			<h3> Abstract</h3>
	    <div>
        <p><strong>Imaging the signals and events that shape embryonic development</strong>.</p>
	      <p><em>Scott E. Fraser<br />
        Anna L Rosen Professor of Biology <br />
        Professor of Engineering and Applied Science</em></p>
	      <p>The explosion of progress in the fields of cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology has offered unprecedented knowledge of the components involved embryonic development.  The dramatic progress of these reductionistic approaches poses the challenge of integrating this knowledge into an understanding of developmental mechanics that pattern and construct the embryo.  Intavital imaging tools offer powerful approaches for eavesdropping on life processes as they take place, and asking questions down to the single cell level.  In parallel, molecular sensors permit ultrasensitive analyses, again to single cell level.  This talk will review our recent advances as well as our applications of these technologies to problems in biology and medicine.  </p>

			<h3>Bio: Scott E. Fraser </h3>
			<p>Scott E. Fraser has a long-standing interest in the imaging and molecular analysis of intact biological systems, and has been active in developing new technologies for novel assays. He has been the Anna L. Rosen Professor of Biology and Director of the Biological Imaging Center at the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology since 1991, and the Director of the Caltech Brain Imaging Center since 2002.  Before coming to Caltech, he served on the faculty and as the Chair of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Fraser earned his B.S. with honors in physics from Harvey Mudd College and his Ph.D. in biophysics with Distinction from Johns Hopkins University. He has been active in the advanced training of interdisciplinary students and post-doctoral fellows.  Dr. Fraser is involved in many professional societies including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society for Developmental Biology, and the American Society for Cell Biology. He is Editor of the journal /Developmental Biology/. His teaching has earned recognition: the Silver Beaker Award for Best Medical School Faculty Member, the Kaiser-Permanente Award for Best Medical School Teaching, and the Caltech Graduate Mentoring Award. Dr. Fraser was also awarded the McKnight Scholar Award, the Marcus Singer Medal, and was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as the European Academy of Science.</p>
