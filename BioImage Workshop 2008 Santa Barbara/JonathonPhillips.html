			<h3> Abstract</h3>

        <div>
          <p align="center"><strong>Evaluations and benchmarking: transitioning from biometrics to bioimaging </strong><br />
          </p>
          <p><em>Dr. P. Jonathon Phillips</em><br />
            <em>Program Manager<br />
          National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) </em></p>
          <p>Techniques and methods for benchmarking and evaluating biometrics are well established. Benchmarking and evaluations have been used to advance algorithm development and measure the state-of-the-art in performance.  In automatic face recognition, these techniques have reduced the error rate by two-orders of magnitude since 1993.  The talk will discuss principles of benchmarking and evaluations that apply to biometrics and bio-imaging.  There are many commonalities between benchmarking biometrics and bio-imaging algorithms; however, for applications covered in this talk, there are also some significant differences.  I will discuss the differences for cancer nodules in CT scans. Finally the talk will present NIST's Biochange 2008 benchmarking effort.  The Biochange 2008 will benchmark algorithms that measure the change in cancer nodule size in CT scans.</p>

			<h3>Bio: Jonathon Phillips </h3>
			<p>Dr. Jonathon Phillips is a leading technologist in the fields of computer vision, biometrics, face recognition, and human identification.  He is at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where is he program manager for the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE), and test director for the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) 2006.  From 2000-2004,  Dr. Phillips was assigned to the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) as program manager for the Human Identification at a Distance program. He was test director for the FRVT 2002. For his work on FRVT 2002 he was awarded the Dept. of Commerce Gold Medal. His current research interests include computer vision, face recognition, biometrics, and computational psycho-physics.  His work has been reported in print media of record including the New York Times and the Economist.  Prior to joining NIST, he was at the US Army Research Laboratory.  He received his Ph.D. in operations research from Rutgers  University. Dr. Phillips is an Associate Editor for IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. He was co-guest editor of the Proceedings of the IEEE special issue on biometrics. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE.</p>
