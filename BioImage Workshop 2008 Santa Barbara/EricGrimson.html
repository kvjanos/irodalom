			<h2>Eric Grimson   -  Abstract and Bio</h2>
			<h3> Abstract</h3>
	    <div>
        <p><strong>On the construction and analysis of patient-specific    models from medical images</strong></p>
        <p><em>Eric Grimson<br>
        Bernard Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering, Associate Department Head  CS/EECS</em></p>
        <p>Algorithmic methods from computer vision and  machine learning are dramatically changing the practice of health care and the  exploration of fundamental issues in neuroscience. By combining knowledge of  expected tissue appearance, atlases of normal anatomy layout, and statistical  models of shape variation, these methods can build detailed, patient-specific  reconstructions of neuroanatomical structure from medical imagery. Such  structural models can be automatically augmented with information about function  (using fMRI), and about connectivity (using DT-MRI) to create detailed models of  a patient’s anatomy. These models are routinely used for surgical planning – how  to reach the target tumor with minimal damage to nearby critical structures; and  for surgical navigation – guiding the surgeon to the target site rapidly and  safely. </p>
        <p>By combining with statistical models of population  variation, these methods can also be used to investigate basic neuroscience  questions – how different are the shapes of structures between normal subjects  and patients with a specific disease (such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s); how  do these shapes change with development in children, or with administration of  pharmaceuticals; how do physiological properties differ between populations  (such as the local structure of fiber orientation in white matter tracts). These  computational methods provide a toolkit for exploring the structure and  connectivity of neuroanatomical structures, in normal subjects and in diseased  patients. <br>

			<h3>Bio: Eric Grimson</h3>
			<p>Professor Eric Grimson is the Bernard  Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering in MIT's Department of Electrical  Engineering and Computer Science. He is a member of MIT's Computer Science and  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and Head of its Computer Vision Group. He  also holds a joint appointment as a Lecturer in Radiology at Harvard Medical  School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital. <br>
			   
			  <br>
			  He received a Bachelor of  Science degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Regina in 1975  and was awarded a Doctorate in Mathematics from MIT in 1980. <br>
			   
			  <br>
			  Professor  Grimson is currently the Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science at MIT. Previously, he served as Associate Department Head for  Computer Science, as well as Education Officer for the  department. <br>
			   
			  <br>
		  Professor Grimson is a Fellow of the IEEE and of AAAI, and  a recipient of the Bose Award for Undergraduate Teaching at MIT. </p>
	    <p>Professor Grimson's research  interests include computer vision and medical image analysis. Since 1975, he and  his research group have pioneered state of the art methods for activity and  behavior recognition, object and person recognition, image database indexing,  site modeling, stereo vision, and many other areas of computer vision. Since the  early 1990s, his group has been applying vision techniques in medicine for  image-guided surgery, disease analysis, and computational anatomy.</p>
