          </p>
          <p>Over the years, many advances have been made in  instrumentation for light microscopy, and image analysis algorithms.  However,  computational cell biology remains out of reach for many investigators because  file formats are proprietary, there are few facilities store, analyze and query  numerical data or analysis results, integration of new algorithms into  proprietary packages is difficult at best, and there are inadequate standards  for sharing image data and results with colleagues.  We have developed an  open-source software framework to address these limitations called the Open  Microscopy Environment (<a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org" target="_blank">http://www.openmicroscopy.org</a>).  OME has three components—an  open data model for biological imaging, standardised file formats and software  libraries for data file conversion and software tools for image data management  and analysis (<a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/downloads/" target="_blank">http://www.openmicroscopy.org/downloads/</a>).  </p>
          <p>The OME Data Model (<a href="http://www.ome-xml.org" target="_blank">http://www.ome-xml.org</a>) has recently been updated to more  fully support fluorescence filter sets, the requirement for unique identifiers,  including LSIDs, and screening experiments using multi-well plates.</p>
          <p>The OME-TIFF file format (<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/ome-tiff.html" target="_blank">http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/ome-tiff.html</a>) and the  Bio-Formats file format library (<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html" target="_blank">http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html</a>) provide an  easy-to-use set of tools for converting data from proprietary file formats.   These resources enable access to data by different processing and visualization  applications, and sharing of data between scientific collaborators.</p>
          <p>The OME Server (<a href="http://openmicroscopy.org/downloads" target="_blank">http://openmicroscopy.org/downloads</a>) is a Perl-based  application for visualising, managing, and analysing microscope images and  metadata. It includes a web browser interface, a threshold segmentation and  tracking application (called "findSpots"), a MatLab interface, support for  VisBio, LDAP, BioFormats.  Now at version 2.6.1, the OME Server is specifically  designed to support complex image analysis processes and includes a distribution  system for parallel analysis.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have recently released the Java-based  OMERO server and client application suite that combines an image metadata  database, a binary image data repository and an image rendering engine for rapid  delivery of rendered images to the user.  OMERO includes OMERO.server, a Java  application running inside a JBOSS application server, a web-based  OMERO.webadmin for user administration (that supports LDAP), OMERO.insight, a  rich client developed in partnership with the Usable Image team (<a href="http://www.usableimage.com" target="_blank">http://www.usableimage.com</a>)  for image data management, visualization, and analysis,  and OMERO.importer, a  client application tool that uses Bio-Formats for proprietary data file import  into an instance of OMERO.server.  The Current release of OMERO.server (Beta2.3; <a href="http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/MilestoneDownloads" target="_blank">http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/MilestoneDownloads</a>)  includes interfaces for C/C++ and Python to support a wider variety of client  applications.  This version of OMERO includes a number of new functions,  including an image tagging system to allow flexible characterization and  searching for image data.  Demos of OMERO functionality are available at <a href="http://openmicroscopy.org/howto/" target="_blank">http://openmicroscopy.org/howto/</a>.  Roadmaps and future  work are available at <a href="http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/roadmap" target="_blank">http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/roadmap</a>.</p>

			<h3>Bio: Jason Swedlow </h3>
			<p>Jason Swedlow earned a BA in Chemistry from Brandeis University in 1982. He performed his PhD in Biophysics with Profs D. A. Agard and J. W. Sedat, finishing in 1994. Dr Swedlow was a postdoctoral fellow with Dr T. J. Mitchison at UCSF and then Harvard Medical School from 1994 and 1998, supported by a Damon Runyon Walter Winchell Cancer Research Fund Fellowship from 1995 to 1997. In 1998, Dr Swedlow established his own laboratory at the Wellcome Trust Biocentre, University of Dundee, Scotland as a Principal Investigator and Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellow. His lab focuses on studies of mitotic and interphase chromosome structure and dynamics and he has published numerous papers in these areas. In 2002, Dr Swedlow was awarded a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship. He participates as Faculty in the Analytical and Quantitative Microscopy Course. He is co-founder of OME (along with Peter Sorger and Ilya Goldberg). </p>
