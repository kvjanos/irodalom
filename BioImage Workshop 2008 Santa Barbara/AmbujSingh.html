			<h3> Abstract</h3>
	    <div>
        <p><strong>Managing uncertainty in bioimage databases</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p><em>Professor  <br>
        Department of Computer Science  <br>
        Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering <br>
          University of California at Santa Barbara </em></p>
        <p>Rapid advances in imaging technologies have  opened the door for a new era of biological research, leading to quantitative  understanding of complex systems. The realization of this potential, however,  critically depends on the availability of tools and technologies to extract  information from imaging data so as to achieve new biological insights and  understanding. The inherent nature of bioimages leads to uncertainty in data,  e.g., to which retinal image layer does a given pixel belong, what is the  thickness of a neurite, how many photoreceptors are there, or what is the length  of a microtubule. Probability distributions are the natural way to model such  phenomena. The aggregation of data (such as the thickness of a layer measured at  different spatial locations or the length of all microtubules in an image) again  leads to probability distributions. I will discuss new probabilistic image  analysis algorithms for measuring biological processes. These include image  segmentation, computing sizes of neurons and their spatial distributions.  Finally, I will discuss new techniques for querying probabilistic data through  index structures that can store distributions at multiple resolutions and scale  to large datasets. <br />
