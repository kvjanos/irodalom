The window on the right is used for specifying training samples, and for validating the automated segmentation and classification results. It displays segmentations as outlines, object ID's, and codes to indicate automated actions (<img src="ldquo.gif" border="0">-G<img src="rdquo.gif" border="0"> implies a glial cell classification, <img src="ldquo.gif" border="0">-X<img src="rdquo.gif" border="0"> indicates a deleted cell). The features of the selected cell are displayed on the lower right. The user can accept, reject, or edit the automated results. By visiting the results in increasing order of segmentation confidence, the user can choose to exit the system once an acceptable confidence is reached. The manual effort is proportional to the number of errors rather than the total number of objects.<br><font size="-2"></font></body>
