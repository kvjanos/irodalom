Cell nuclei (blob-like objects) are shown in green. Blood vessels (tube-like objects) are shown in red, and the unstructured cloud-like object in the third channel (blue) is the Nissl cytoplasmic stain. Notice that three general blob morphologies can be distinguished: larger, dimmer, and more heterogenous neuronal nuclei; smaller, brighter and more uniform glia; and flat, intense endothelial cells. Differences in cloud shape and volume can also be used to distinguish larger pyramidal neurons from other neuron types.<br><font size="-2"></font></body>
