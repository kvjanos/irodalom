V2.7.1   16-May-01  Add new ports: Solaris on PC, MacOS X and Linux on 
                       DEC/Alpha. 
                    Correct bugs in CDFDump program.
                    Correct and enhance CDF-Java APIs and Java Native 
                       Interface (JNI).
                    Add new Java-based tool programs for CDFEdit and CDFExport.
                    Add variable name checking in CDFconvert for compression 
                       option.
                    Add Cygwin port for win32 on PC. Create individual tool
                       programs for Windows using Cygwin libraries.
      	 05-Dec-01  Add a new set of APIs: CDFgetrVarsRecordData, 
                    CDFgetzVarsRecordData, CDFputrVarsRecordData and 
                    CDFputzVarsRecordData to allow a full single 
                    record read/write for a group of r/zVariables.  
         26-Jan-02  Correct a bug in cdfcmp.c for showing dimension size 
                    differences between two zVariables. 
         28-Jun-02  Add a new option in cdfcmp.c to allow tolerance checks
                    while comparing two unequal data values.
         22-Jul-02  Handle f77 Fortran for Cygwin. 
         25-Nov-02  Add 64-bit mode for Solaris/sparc64 for sparcv9. Also,
                    gcc for 64-bit is added.
V2.7.2   08-Apr-04  Change the way that current variable select is being
                    handled.  Keep the current variable selected offset as a 
                    reference for any following variable selection. Originally, 
                    each time a selection of a variable or getting a variable's 
                    field data will start the search for that variable ALWAYS 
                    from the beginning of the variable list. It requires too 
                    many I/Os for accessing a sequence of variables. 
         04-May-04  Corrected a bug that caused the f77 to fail under 64-bit
                    environment.
V3.0     07-Jan-05  Changed file offset from type long (32-bit) to off_t 
                       (64-bit) for the platform on which the data type is 
                       supported.  Changed the file I/O functions accordingly. 
                       The CDF internal file structures are changed. Made the 
                       library backward compatible, meaning programs created 
                       from V3.0 can still access (read/update) the CDF files 
                       of older version.
                    Expanded the length of variable and attribute name from
                       64 to 256.  
                    The CDF/Java was modified to ensure that concurrent 
                       accessing a CDF would be thread-safe.
                    Added a new data type, CDF_EPOCH16, to
                       accommodate more refined time resolution within a
                       second. A new set of functions, similar to those
                       of CDF_EPOCH data type, was added.
                    Modified cdfdump tool program to be more efficient in
                       data reading.
         25-Mar-05  Changed JNI and Java-CDF APIs to ensure proper operations 
                    within the multiple-threaded environment.
V3.1.0   27-May-05  Added new sets of APIs to allow Standard Interface to 
                    interact with zVariables and other CDF-related
                    information.
         11-Jul-05  Added MingW port for PC.
         05-Aug-05  Added new functions to allow creating CDF files in
                    older, V2.7, version, not just the default V3.1. 	 
         18-Jan-06  Modified code, including tools, to handle file path
                    that has ".cdf" or ".skt" extension while it is not
                    expected to be there.
         30-Jan-06  Add FreeBSD port for PCs.
          1-Feb-06  Added Intel C++ and Fortran compilers for Linux port on PCs.
