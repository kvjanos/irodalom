  Update to reflect lp_solve version 2.2 (by changing "2.0" to "2.2"
in various places).  Return solve_result_num and .sstatus to AMPL.
(Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to suggest a starting
basis to lp_solve.)  Shift variables with negative lower bounds
to reflect lp_solve's restriction to variables with nonnegative
lower bounds.

  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

  README, lpsolve.c, makefile: adjust for version 3.0; should future
versions of lp_solve appear, it may suffice to change the LPSOLVE =
line in the makefile to point to the directory for the version of
interest.

 lpsolve.c: portability tweak: change (int) to Intcast.
 makefile: renamed makefile.u (for Unix); makefile.vc added.

Thu Feb  3 22:39:16 EST 2000
  makefile.vc: adjusted reflecting changes to ../makefile.vc.

Tue Oct  3 00:28:07 EDT 2000
  lpsolve.c: fix bug in supplying variable bounds in problems
involving some free variables (-Infinity <= var <= +Infinity)
followed by variables with finite nonzero bounds.  Example:
steelpl5.mod + steelpl5.dat in the AMPL book.
