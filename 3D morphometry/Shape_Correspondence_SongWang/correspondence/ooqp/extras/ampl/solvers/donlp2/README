It uses an SQP algorithm and dense-matrix linear algebra.

File donlp2.o is an object form of DONLP2 source file donlp2.f .

Possible solve_result_num values for donlp2:

0	Success! KKT conditions satisfied
100	nearly feasible with small directional deriv.
101	relaxed KKT conditions satisfied: singular point
101	small QP correction: nearly feasible and singular
200	tiny correction from QP at infeasible point
400	reached maxit steps
500	N too large (the Fortran donlp2 routines must be recompiled)
501	unknown termination reason
510	cannot evaluate constraints
511	cannot evaluate objective
520	dual extended QP failure: singular working set
521	infeasible QP
522	no descent in QP
523	tiny QP step from infeasible point
524	nondescent direction from QP
525	no acceptable step size
527	tiny step
528	more than NRESET small primal corrections
529	max(N,10) small penalty function differences
540	slow primal progress: singular or ill-conditioned problem?


Scaling (new 19980606):  in an AMPL session, if you declare

	option suffix vsclog10;

then variable.vsclog10 (default 0) is passed to donlp2, which scales
the variable internally by 10^-variable.vsclog10.  Thus if variables x
and y are distances in meters that have typical values of a few
centimeters and a few kilometers, respectively, then
	let x.vsclog10 := -2;
	let y.vsclog10 := 3;
woudl probably be appropriate, since it would give the internal
variables typical values around 1.
