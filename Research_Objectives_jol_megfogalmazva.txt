Research Objectives

As biological phenomena are being probed and mapped in ever-greater detail, biologists from a wide range of subdisciplines are facing an exponentially growing volume of increasingly complex-structured data, information, and knowledge.

A fundamental challenge for bioinformaticians and computational biologists is to explore, manage, share, analyse and interpret this information effectively and efficiently. The Systems Biology Research Group was established to address this challenge.

The Groupâ€™s vision is strongly influenced by systems biology as a framework for biology in the post-genomic era. Currently, the Group is engaged in a number of research projects in areas such as the

   1. Application and development of analysis and interpretation methods for biological data using machine learining and statistics,
   2. Application and development of methods for integrating, managing, and sharing of biomedical information using database, data/text mining, data warehousing, and grid technology,
   3. Application and development of methods for processing of image data (e.g. from microscopy) an for modeling of computational geometry of biological structures and processes,
   4. Application and development of methods for system-level modelling and simulation (e.g., gene networks, kinase/phosphatase interaction networks, protein unfolding simulations),
   5. Application and development of methods for predicting subcellular localization of various biochemical entities,
   6. Application and development of methods for analysis and interpretation of scientific articles and texts using text mining and natural language processing,
   7. Application and development grid technologies in biology and Systems Biology.
