"Generalized brain neurodegeneration has been studied
in blue cheese (bchs) Drosophila mutants (Lim and Kraut,
2009), where ubiquitinated protein accumulation and a failure
of degradative trafficking pathways have been implicated (Finley
et al., 2003; Simonsen et al., 2004)."

"We have previously shown that Alfy is ubiquitously
expressed in mouse tissue, with highest levels found in brain
(Simonsen et al., 2004). In Drosophila, expression level of the
Alfy homolog bchs is highest in neurons. Alfy/bchs may be
especially important in nondividing cells, which require more
‘‘help’’ to clear aggregate-prone or aggregated proteins to
prevent accumulation of protein aggregates. Consistent with
this are previously published studies demonstrating that loss of
Bchs leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in fly
neurons (Finley et al., 2003). Our complementary experiment
using overexpression of Alfy in neurons shows..."
