Fig.7. MCF10A cells are growth factor dependent: they proliferate in the presence of growth
factors and undergo apoptosis in their absence. A) 3000 cells/well were seeded on a 96-well plate,
and, when attached, either kept in full medium or starved overnight. At the indicated time points, cell
numbers were deduced by the measurement of mitochondrial activity using the AlamarBlue assay.
Green shows proliferation under full medium, red under starvation conditions. B) 2000 cells/well were
seeded on a 384-well plate and, several hours later, either left untreated or starved. 48 h later,
apoptosis was measured by the caspase-3 activation assay. The fold induction was calculated setting
as reference the values in full medium of each respective cell line. Shown are the mean values and
standard deviations of four measurements. Blue (resp violet) apoptosis in full medium (resp upon
starvation).
