MCF10A 

Human immortalized breast epithelial cell line; ATCC cell
line CRL-10317. These cells are cultivated in
DMEM/Ham12 supplemented with 10% Horse Serum,
2 mM L-Glutamine, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml
Choleratoxin, and 500 ng/ml Hydrocortison.

4.4.1.2.2 Transfection of MCF10A

These cells were transfected by lipofection, using the Effectene transfection reagent
(Qiagen). The day before transfection, 4x10^5 cells/well were seeded onto a 6 well
plate. The next morning, cells were washed with PBS and 1.6 ml full medium
dispensed. 4 µg of DNA were diluted in EC Buffer (100 µl total volume), 8 µl
enhancer were added and mixed by vortexing for 1 sec. The mixture was incubated
at RT for 2-5 min, and spinned down. 25 µl Effectene transfection were dispensed
and mixed by pipetting up and down 5 times, and incubated at RT 5-10 min. 600 µl
full medium were added, mixed again by pipetting up and down twice, and dispensed
dropwise onto the cells, while the plate was gently swirled. 24 h later, selection was
started.

4.4.1.2.3 Generation of stable cell lines
In order to determine the antibiotic concentration to be applied for selection, each cell
line was tested separately. Untransfected cells were plated on 6-well plates, so as to
have them at approx. 90% confluency. The following day, a range of antibiotic
concentrations (specific for each antibiotic) was added to the cells, and the
percentage of dead cells was monitored over the next two weeks. The concentration
chosen for selection was such that it caused the death of >80% of the cells within the
first week, and >95% after the second week. An appropriate concentration should not
kill all cells within 48 h.

24 h after transfection with a specific plasmid, the required antibiotic was added at
the established concentrations. Cells were monitored over the following weeks. Once
large clones had appeared (should be visible with the bare eye around the third or
forth week), they were picked up with a pipette tip and transferred to a 96-well plate.
The clones were expanded and passed into 24, 12, and then 6 well plates. As soon
as cells were available in sufficient number, they were screened for expression of the
desired protein, while they were expanded to prepare a stock of the cell line.

4.4.1.8 Apoptosis analysis
Caspase activation assay: MCF10A cells were seeded in 50 µl on a 384-well plate
and several hours later, when attached, starved overnight. The next morning medium
was changed and EGF was added to the treated group, and 24 h later the 50 µl
caspase substrate (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Rhodamine) dilution to all cells. 3 hours later,
the product (rhodamine) was measured by fluorescence (excitation λ 499 nm,
emission λ 521 nm) with a Spectra Magemini fluorescence reader.
