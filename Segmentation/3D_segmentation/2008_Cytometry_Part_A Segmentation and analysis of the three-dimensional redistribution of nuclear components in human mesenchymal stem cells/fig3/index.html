(<b>A</b>) Maximum intensity projections of single hMSC expressing CenpA-GFP (green) and Trf1-DsRed (Red), before (mock-treated) and after caspase-8 activation (+AP20187, 4 h treatment). (<b>B</b>) Cumulative distribution function plots showing changes in the relative distribution of CenpA and Trf1 signals during caspase-8 activation in a single representative cell. Analyses were carried out in cells expressing the FKC8 vector before and after caspase-8 activation (+AP20187). Four hours after AP20187 treatment, the nucleus showed a round shape and after 6 h a convoluted shape. The plots show that in normal hMSCs, the spatial distribution of CenpA is more central compared with that of Trf1. Upon caspase-8 activation, the cumulative distribution function plots reveal a clear shift in CenpA localization towards the periphery in round-shape nuclei. A very similar distribution of CenpA and Trf1 is found in convoluted nuclei. The <i>P</i> values of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the two sample Kolmogorov- Smirnov test are given by <i>P</i>(W) and <i>P</i>(KS) respectively.<br><font size="-2"></font></body>
