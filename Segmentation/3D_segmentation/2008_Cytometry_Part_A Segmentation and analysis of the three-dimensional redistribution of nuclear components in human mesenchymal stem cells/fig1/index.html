(<b>A</b>) Image representations of the different segmentation methods in one nucleus. The red line outlines the nuclear boundary, which was found by each of the segmentation methods. The <i>n</i> segmentation is calculated from the logarithmic stretched image of the background of the probe signal (i). The <i>nla</i> segmentation is calculated from the logarithmic stretched image of the lamina signal (ii). The <i>la</i> segmentation is calculated from the image of the lamina signal (iii). (<b>B</b>) Cumulative distribution function plot of Trf1-DsRed spatial distribution. Plots show the distribution of pooled data from five cells after activation of caspase-8 at passage 4 using the three segmentation methods, object background (<i>n</i>), lamina in background mode (<i>nla</i>), and the lamina (<i>la</i>). (<b>C</b>) Linear regression analyses of the pooled data (B) reveals that the <i>nla</i> and <i>la</i> segmentation methods are statistically equivalent. The <i>n</i> method, however, gives a good estimation of the spatial localization of the probes in the nucleus, as compared with the other two methods.<br><font size="-2"></font></body>
