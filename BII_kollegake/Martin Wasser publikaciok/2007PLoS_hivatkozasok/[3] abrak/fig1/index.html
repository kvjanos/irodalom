The images are from triple labelings of EAST with pAb ED3 (green), Skeletor with mAb 1A1 (red), and with Hoechst (blue). The composite images (comp) are shown to the left. During prophase, metaphase, and telophase the composite images (comp) show extensive overlap between Megator and Skeletor labeling as indicated by the yellow color. The images are from confocal sections of syncytial embryonic nuclei.
