The relative migration of molecular weight markers in kDa are indicated to the right in grey numerals. <b>B</b>: Immunoprecipitation (ip) of S2 cell lysate was performed using the mAb 5B1 (<b>lane 3</b>) coupled to immunobeads or with immunobeads only as a control (<b>lane 2</b>). The immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using EAST pAb ED3 for detection. EAST pAb ED3 staining of S2 cell lysate is shown in <b>lane 1</b>. EAST is detected in the mAb 5B1 immunoprecipitation sample as a 265 kDa band (lane 3) but not in the control sample (lane 2).<br><font size="-2"></font></body>
