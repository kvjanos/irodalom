The composite images (comp) are shown to the <b>left</b>. At prophase EAST and Megator labeling overlap in the nuclear interior whereas Megator labeling is prominent at the nuclear rim. During metaphase the composite image (comp) shows extensive overlap between EAST and Megator labeling as indicated by the predominantly yellow color. At telophase where EAST begins to redistribute back around the chromosomes Megator appears to be preferentially localized to the spindle midbody. <b>B</b>: The images are from triple labeling of EAST with mAb 5B1 (green), tubulin with a rat anti-<img src="alpha.gif" border="0">-tubulin mAb (red), and DNA with Hoechst (blue). The EAST antibody clearly labels a true fusiform spindle structure that is co-aligned with the microtubule spindle except for the centrosomes. The images in (A) and (B) are from confocal sections of syncytial embryonic nuclei.
