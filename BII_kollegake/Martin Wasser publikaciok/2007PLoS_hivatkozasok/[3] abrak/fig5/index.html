The immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using EAST pAb ED3 for detection. EAST pAb ED3 staining of S2 cell lysate is shown in <b>lane 1</b>. EAST is detected in the Megator ip sample as a 265 kDa band (lane 3) but not in the control sample (lane 2). <b>B</b>: Immunoprecipitation of S2 cell lysate was performed using EAST pAb ED3 (<b>lane 3</b>) coupled to immunobeads or with immunobeads only as a control (<b>lane 2</b>). The immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using Megator mAb 12F10 for detection. Megator mAb 12F10 staining of S2 cell lysate is shown in <b>lane 1</b>.
