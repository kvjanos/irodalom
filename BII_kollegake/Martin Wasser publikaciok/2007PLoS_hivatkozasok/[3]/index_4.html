EAST and Megator also colocalize to the intranuclear space surrounding the chromosomes at interphase. EAST is a novel protein that does not have any previously characterized motifs or functional domains. However, we show by immunoprecipitation experiments that EAST is likely to molecularly interact with Megator which has a large NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal coiled-coil domain with the capacity for self assembly. On the basis of these findings, we propose that Megator and EAST interact to form a nuclear endoskeleton and as well are important components of the putative spindle matrix complex during mitosis. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr align="left" size="1" width="25%">Received: 15 February 2005; Accepted: 10 March 2005<p></p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="mainSectionHeader"><a name="doi">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br>10.1002/jcb.20495&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="help" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/doiinfo.html">About DOI</a><br><p></p><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="mainSectionHeader"><a name="articletext">Article Text</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>During cell division the entire nucleus undergoes a dynamic and tightly orchestrated reorganization. Major structural components of the nucleus such as the nucleolus and the nuclear lamina are completely dismantled and then reassembled in the forming daughter nuclei after chromosome segregation. Many of the proteins making up these structures are either degraded or recycled through incorporation into vesicles [Moir et al., [<a href="#BIB10">2000</a>]; Olson et al., [<a href="#BIB11">2000</a>]]. Other proteins known as <img src="ldquo.gif" border="0">the chromosomal passengers<img src="rdquo.gif" border="0"> become associated with the condensing chromosomes during prophase, accumulate at the inner centromeres in prometaphase, then at the onset of anaphase leave the chromosomes and transfer to the central spindle before concentrating at the midbody at cytokinesis [Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, [<a href="#BIB20">2004</a>]]. A third class of nuclear proteins reorganizes during prophase and/or prometaphase to form or associate with various parts of the mitotic spindle apparatus [Merdes et al., [<a href="#BIB8">1996</a>]; Dionne et al., [<a href="#BIB1">1999</a>]; Wittmann et al., [<a href="#BIB25">2001</a>]; Raemaekers et al., [<a href="#BIB15">2003</a>]].</p><p>In <i>Drosophila</i> we have recently identified three nuclear proteins, Skeletor, Chromator, and Megator [Walker et al., [<a href="#BIB21">2000</a>]; Qi et al., [<a href="#BIB14">2004</a>]; Rath et al., [<a href="#BIB16">2004</a>]] that redistribute during prophase forming a fusiform spindle structure that persists in the absence of polymerized tubulin [Walker et al., [<a href="#BIB21">2000</a>]; Qi et al., [<a href="#BIB14">2004</a>]]. The features of this structure are compatible with those of a spindle matrix which on theoretical grounds has been proposed to provide a stationary substrate that anchors molecules during force production and microtubule sliding [Pickett-Heaps et al., [<a href="#BIB12">1982</a>], [<a href="#BIB13">1997</a>]; Johansen and Johansen, [<a href="#BIB4">2002</a>]]. Two of these proteins, Skeletor and Chromator, are localized to chromosomes during interphase [Walker et al., [<a href="#BIB21">2000</a>]; Rath et al., [<a href="#BIB16">2004</a>]] whereas the third, Megator (Bx34 antigen), occupies the intranuclear space surrounding the chromosomes in addition to being localized to the nuclear rim [Zimowska et al., [<a href="#BIB26">1997</a>]; Qi et al., [<a href="#BIB14">2004</a>]]. Megator is a 260 kDa protein with a large NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal coiled-coil domain and a shorter COOH-terminal acidic region that shows overall structural and sequence similarity to the mammalian nuclear pore complex Tpr protein [Zimowska et al., [<a href="#BIB26">1997</a>]]. Another large protein in <i>Drosophila</i> that associates with an interior non-chromosomal compartment of the interphase nucleus is EAST [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB23">2000</a>], [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. Loss-of-function <i>east</i> mutations lead to an increased frequency of mitotic errors as well as to abnormal congression of chromosomes in prometaphase [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. Here we show using cross-immunoprecipitations and immunocytochemistry that EAST interacts with Megator and that EAST colocalizes with Skeletor and Megator to the putative spindle matrix as it is defined by these proteins during mitosis.</p><p></p><div class="firstLevelHeading"><a name="SEC1-1">MATERIALS AND METHODS</a></div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="#abstract"><img src="sec_up_small.gif" alt="Abstract" border="0"></a></td><td><img src="sec_here_small.gif" alt="MATERIALS AND METHODS" border="0"></td><td><a href="#SEC1-2"><img src="sec_down_small.gif" alt="RESULTS" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#SEC1-3"><img src="sec_down_small.gif" alt="DISCUSSION" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#acknowledgements"><img src="sec_down_small.gif" alt="Acknowledgements" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#references"><img src="sec_down_small.gif" alt="References" border="0"></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class="firstLevelHeading"><a name="SEC2-1"><i>Drosophila</i> Stocks</a></div><p>Fly stocks were maintained according to standard protocols [Roberts, [<a href="#BIB17">1986</a>]].

The correct orientation and reading frame of the inserts were verified by sequencing. The GST-239 and GST-117 fusion proteins were expressed in XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified over a glutathione agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), according to the pGEX manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mAb 5B1 was generated by injection of 50 <img src="mu.gif" align="absbottom" border="0">g of GST-239 into BALB/c mice at 21 day intervals. After the third boost, mouse spleen cells were fused with Sp2 myeloma cells and monospecific hybridoma lines were established using standard procedures [Harlow and Lane, [<a href="#BIB2">1988</a>]].

The embryos were dechorionated in a 50% Chlorox solution, washed with 0.7M NaCl/0.2% Triton X-100 and fixed in a 1:1 heptane:fixative mixture for 20 min with vigorous shaking at room temperature. The fixative was either 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Bouin's fluid (0.66% picric acid, 9.5% formalin, and 4.7% acetic acid). Vitelline membranes were then removed by shaking embryos in heptane-methanol [Mitchison and Sedat, [<a href="#BIB9">1983</a>]] at room temperature for 30 s. Double and triple labelings employing epifluorescence were performed using various combinations of antibodies against Megator (mAb 12F10, IgG1), EAST (mAb 5B1, IgM; pAb ED3; pAb IgY), Skeletor (mAb 1A1, IgM), anti-<img src="alpha.gif" border="0">-tubulin rat IgG2a, and Hoechst to visualize the DNA. The appropriate species and isotype specific Texas Red-, TRITC-, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel/ICN, Southern Biotech) were used (1:200 dilution) to visualize primary antibody labeling. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Leica confocal TCS NT microscope system equipped with separate Argon-UV, Argon, and Krypton lasers and the appropriate filter sets for Hoechst, FITC, Texas Red, and TRITC imaging. A separate series of confocal images for each fluorophor of double labeled preparations were obtained simultaneously with z-intervals of typically 0.5 <img src="mu.gif" align="absbottom" border="0">m using a PL APO 100X/1.40-0.70 oil objective. A maximum projection image for each of the image stacks was obtained using the ImageJ software (<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" target="_top">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a>). In some cases individual slices or projection images from only two to three slices were obtained. Images were imported into Photoshop where they were pseudocolored, image processed, and merged. In some images non-linear adjustments were made for optimal visualization especially of Hoechst labelings of nuclei and chromosomes. Polytene chromosome squash preparations from late third instar larvae were immunostained by EAST antibodies and Megator antibody essentially as previously described by Zink and Paro [[<a href="#BIB27">1989</a>]], Jin et al.

Furthermore, considerable EAST immunoreactivity has been reported to be present around the metaphase plate during mitosis although the exact nature of this labeling was not resolved [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB23">2000</a>], [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. For these reasons, we revisited the issue of EAST antibody labeling during the cell cycle in syncytial <i>Drosophila</i> embryos fixed with Bouin's fluid, a precipitative fixative characterized by its rapid penetration and efficient fixation of nuclear proteins [Johansen and Johansen, [<a href="#BIB5">2003</a>]]. Figure <a href="#FIG1">1</a> shows double labelings with EAST antibody and the mAb 1A1 to the spindle matrix protein, Skeletor [Walker et al., [<a href="#BIB21">2000</a>]]. The EAST antibody is the mouse antiserum (pAb ED3) used in the original EAST localization study by Wasser and Chia, [[<a href="#BIB23">2000</a>]]. The double labeling were made possible by the fact that mAb 1A1 is of the IgM subtype that can be selectively recognized with TRITC-conjugated IgM specific secondary antibody and that EAST pAb ED3 can be detected with FITC-conjugated IgG (IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2A</sub>, IgG<sub>2B</sub>) specific secondary antibody that does not cross react with IgM antibody. Furthermore, control experiments in which pAb ED3 single labeling were incubated with the TRITC-conjugated IgM secondary antibody showed that the EAST antiserum contained no detectable levels of EAST antibody of the IgM subtype at the antibody dilutions used for staining. Therefore, there was no cross reactivity in the detection of the two antigens in the employed labeling protocol. Figure <a href="#FIG1">1</a> shows that as mitosis commences EAST reorganizes during prophase into a fusiform spindle structure the pattern of which during metaphase appears identical to that of the putative spindle matrix protein Skeletor. At telophase both EAST and Skeletor redistribute back to the forming daughter nuclei. This localization of EAST during mitosis was also obtained in single labeling studies with pAb ED3 (data not shown).

One antibody was a chicken antiserum (pAb IgY) that labels a single protein band of <img src="sim.gif" border="0">265 kDa on immunoblots of S2 cell extracts consistent with the predicted molecular mass of EAST of 253 kDa (Fig. <a href="#FIG2">2</a>A). This band is also labeled by the original EAST antibody pAb ED3 (Fig. <a href="#FIG2">2</a>A). A second antibody we generated was a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5B1. mAb 5B1 is of the IgM subtype and did not label immunoblots. However, in immunoprecipitation assays of S2 cell lysates mAb 5B1 immunoprecipitated a 265 kDa protein detected by the EAST antibody pAb ED3 (Fig. <a href="#FIG2">2</a>B). A similarly sized band was labeled by pAb ED3 in the S2 cell lysate but not in the beads only immunoprecipitation control (Fig. <a href="#FIG2">2</a>B). These findings demonstrate that mAb 5B1 immunoprecipitates the EAST protein. Immunocytologically, the staining patterns of pAb IgY and mAb 5B1 were indistinguishable from that of pAb ED3 in the polytene salivary gland and early syncytial embryo preparations examined.

Figure <a href="#FIG3">3</a> shows such labeling with EAST pAb IgY and Megator mAb 12F10 of light squashes of polytene salivary gland nuclei where both EAST and Megator labeling surround the chromosomes. Furthermore, EAST and Megator appear to colocalize as indicated by the predominantly yellow color in the composite image of Figure <a href="#FIG3">3</a>D. Figure <a href="#FIG4">4</a>A shows the relative distribution of EAST as labeled by mAb 5B1 and Megator as labeled by mAb 12F10 during mitosis in syncytial <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. Both proteins reorganize as mitosis commences into fusiform spindle structures at metaphase where the two proteins are colocalized (Fig. <a href="#FIG4">4</a>A) and where the EAST-defined spindle is co-aligned with the microtubule spindle apparatus (Fig. <a href="#FIG4">4</a>B). At telophase EAST redistributes back to the forming daughter nuclei whereas Megator can be observed only in the spindle midbody. Thus, while EAST and Megator mostly are colocalized during the cell cycle their distributions are not identical. Another difference is that Megator shows strong localization to the nuclear rim during interphase and prophase whereas EAST does not (Fig. <a href="#FIG4">4</a>A) suggesting that EAST and Megator may have overlapping as well as distinct functions in the interphase nucleus.

Based on overexpression studies of EAST in polyploid cells, it has been proposed that EAST may be part of an internal nucleoskeleton that at interphase regulates nuclear volume and the distribution of some nuclear proteins such as CP60 and actin [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB23">2000</a>]]. However, recent studies of chromosome behavior in <i>east</i> loss-of-function mutations during mitosis and meiosis suggested that EAST may also play an important role in the congression and alignment of chromosomes during prophase and prometaphase as well as in regulating chromosome movement at metaphase [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. Interestingly, abnormal chromosome localization in <i>east</i> mutants can be observed in prophase of male meiosis before nuclear envelope breakdown and before the chromosomes can establish interactions with microtubules [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. These findings provide evidence that EAST may function to guide or constrain chromosome congression [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]]. Moreover, the continued colocalization of EAST with Megator during prophase suggests that Megator may interact with EAST to play a role in this process as well. When Megator levels were knocked down by RNAi in S2 cell cultures no defects in tubulin spindle morphology or chromosome segregation were apparent; however a significant reduction in the number of cells undergoing mitosis was observed suggesting that depletion of Megator prevents cells from entering metaphase [Qi et al., [<a href="#BIB14">2004</a>]]. These results suggest that both EAST and Megator have important functions in nuclear reorganization during prophase.</p><p>The colocalization of EAST with the Skeletor- and Megator-defined spindle matrix during metaphase suggests that EAST may be involved in spindle matrix function. In its simplest formulation a spindle matrix is hypothesized to provide a more or less stationary substrate that provides a backbone or strut for motor molecules to interact with during force generation and microtubule sliding [Pickett-Heaps et al., [<a href="#BIB13">1997</a>]; Johansen and Johansen, [<a href="#BIB4">2002</a>]]. Thus, a prediction of the spindle matrix hypothesis is that if such a scaffold were interfered with in a way that it could not properly anchor motor proteins, the dynamic behavior of spindle components such as motors would be affected leading to abnormal chromosome alignment and segregation [Rath et al., [<a href="#BIB16">2004</a>]]. Such a phenotype of chromosomes scattered within the metaphase spindle was observed in S2 cells after RNAi depletion of the putative spindle matrix protein Chromator [Rath et al., [<a href="#BIB16">2004</a>]]. Similar abnormal arrangements of chromosomes where the chromosomes strayed away from the metaphase plate and adopted a scattered configuration were also observed by Wasser and Chia [[<a href="#BIB24">2003</a>]] in approximately 50% of <i>east</i> mutant spermatocytes in metaphase. Thus, these findings taken together indicate that EAST is likely to be the fourth member of a group of proteins derived from two different nuclear compartments that reorganize during mitosis to form a spindle matrix.</p><p>EAST is a novel protein of 2,362 amino acids which apart from seven potential nuclear localization sequences and twelve potential PEST sites does not have any other previously characterized motifs or functional domains [Wasser and Chia, [<a href="#BIB23">2000</a>]]. However, we show by immunoprecipitation experiments that EAST is likely to be present in a molecular complex together with Megator. Megator has a large NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal coiled-coil domain and we have demonstrated by expression construct analysis in S2 cells that this domain has the capacity for self assembly [Qi et al., [<a href="#BIB14">2004</a>]]. This raises the intriguing possibility that Megator can form polymers, which could serve as the structural basis for both a possible nuclear extrachromosomal endoskeleton and for the spindle matrix. Because both EAST and Megator localize to the extrachromosomal nuclear compartment at interphase and the spindle matrix at mitosis, it is not clear whether the interaction observed in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments reflected interactions in an interphase complex or interactions on the spindle-like structure or both. The future challenge will be to determine how the reorganization of these proteins is coordinated and how the resulting molecular complex affects chromosome dynamics and cell division.</p><p></p><div class="firstLevelHeading"><a name="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="#abstract"><img src="sec_up_small.gif" alt="Abstract" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#SEC1-1"><img src="sec_up_small.gif" alt="MATERIALS AND METHODS" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#SEC1-2"><img src="sec_up_small.gif" alt="RESULTS" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="#SEC1-3"><img src="sec_up_small.gif" alt="DISCUSSION" border="0"></a></td><td><img src="sec_here_small.gif" alt="Acknowledgements" border="0"></td><td><a href="#references"><img src="sec_down_small.gif" alt="References" border="0"></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We thank members of the laboratory for discussion, advice, and critical reading of the manuscript.
