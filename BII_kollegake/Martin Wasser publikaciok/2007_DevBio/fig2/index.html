<p><img src="0" alt="Image" align="bottom" border="0" height="935" width="363"></p><p>Fig. 2.&nbsp;(A) EAST and Chromator interact in the yeast two-hybrid system. The C-terminal residues 1535–2301 of EAST fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 were used to screen an embryonic cDNA library fused to the transactivating domain of GAL4. We identified 11 independent preys containing the C-terminal end of Chro. The Chro interacting domain (CID) in EAST was narrowed down to residues 1965–2143. In the bar representing Chro, the conserved Chromo-domain (CD) and the putative EAST interacting domain (EID) are indicated. (B) Localization of EAST and Chro in larval salivary glands. Anti-Chro antibody (red) labels the interbands of polytene chromosomes (white) and, like EAST-GFP (green), also localizes to non-chromosomal regions. (C, D) Genetic interactions between <i>east</i> and <i>Chro</i> mutations. (C) Reducing the dosage of <i>east</i> improves the viability of <i>Chro</i> homozygous pupae. Homozygous larvae of three <i>Chro</i> alleles <i>Chro</i><sup>17a</sup>, <i>Chro</i><sup>60a</sup> and <i>Chro</i><sup>109c</sup> develop into eclosing adults at a higher frequency if they are heterozygous for <i>east</i><sup>hop7</sup> compared to animals that carry two wild-type copies of <i>east</i>. Among the eclosing homozygous <i>w;Chro</i> adults we observed both males and females. The surviving <i>Chro</i> homozygous offspring of <i>east/FM7;Chro/TM6B mothers</i> only consisted of <i>east/FM7</i> females; <i>east</i> hemizygous or <i>FM7</i> homozygous did not eclose. <i>east/w and FM7/w</i> progeny was generated by crossing <i>east/FM7;Chro/TM6B</i> females with <i>w;Chro/TM6B</i> males. <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;number of homozygous pupae scored, ‘% homozygous’ represents the proportion of homozygous among total number of pupae scores and ‘% pupae eclosing’ the percentage of <i>Chro</i> homozygous pupae eclosing. (D) Phases of developmental arrest of <i>MHC-tauGFP</i> expressing animals. Shown are the proportions of larvae of the indicated genotypes dying as pupae, as pharate adults, as semi-eclosed adults and as adults emerging from the puparium. Reducing the dosage of <i>east</i> by half leads to more advanced stages of development. However, <i>east</i> hemizygotes are not rescued by reducing the dosage of <i>Chro</i>. <i>east</i> is the abbreviation for <i>east</i><sup>hop7</sup>, <i>FM7</i> stands for <i>FM7i-pAct-GFP</i>.
