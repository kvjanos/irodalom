<p><img src="0" alt="Image" align="bottom" border="0" height="461" width="578"></p><p>Fig. 1.&nbsp;Mutations in <i>east</i> and <i>Chro</i> interfere with the differentiation of adult muscles. Muscles of pharate adults were labeled with <i>MHC-tauGFP</i>. Compared to controls (A), testis muscles (green) of <i>east</i><sup>hop7</sup> (B) pharate adults are ruptured causing the tip of the testis to bulge out. DNA in panels A and B were stained with TOPRO3 (blue). (C–H) Dorsal views of live pharate adults. The <i>MHC-tauGFP</i> reporter (white) labels the temporary dorsal internal oblique muscles (TDIOM) of abdominal segments I to V and the indirect flight muscles (IFM in panel C) of the thorax. (C) Pattern of TDIOMs in a control pharate adult. Individual TDIOMs in segments II and III are indicated (#, arrow, arrowhead). (D, E) <i>east</i><sup><i>hop7</i></sup> mutants display various defects including missing (# in panel D) and morphologically abnormal muscles in terms of size (arrow in panel D) and shape (arrowhead in panel E). Other defects include abnormal orientations (arrow in panel E) and fused muscles (* in panel E). (F) <i>Chro</i> mutants display absent or malformed abdominal musculature (arrow). Their abdomens are filled with <i>MHC-tauGFP</i>-labeled debris that produces a diffuse fluorescence. (H) <i>east</i><sup>hop7</sup><i>/MHC-tauGFP;Chro</i><sup>109c</sup> pharates show a rescue of muscle development compared to their (G) <i>FM7c/MHC-tauGFP;Chro</i><sup>109c</sup> siblings. Pharates in panels G and H were dissected out of the pupal case prior to image acquisition due to the weaker signals in animals heterozygous for the <i>MHC-tauGFP</i> reporter. Scale bars: 100&nbsp;μm in panel A also applies to panel B; 100&nbsp;μm in panel C also applies to panels D–H.
