(A) Wild-type salivary 12&nbsp;h APF. Filamentous actin labeled by phalloidin (red) outlines the cell cortex while TOPRO3 was used to visualize the polytene chromosomes (white). At 15&nbsp;h APF, shrinkage of the glands, condensation and fragmentation of polytene chromosomes (arrow) and aggregates of filamentous actin (arrowhead) indicate that the cells are undergoing programmed cell death. At 18&nbsp;h, the glands cannot be detected anymore. (B) Salivary glands cells overexpressing EAST-GFP (green) at 15&nbsp;h do not show the cytoskeletal and nuclear changes associated with apoptosis in wild-type. Cells maintaining EAST-GFP expression (white arrow) at 20&nbsp;h APF contain chromosomes without signs of apoptosis. However, they are intermingled with clumps of DNA (yellow arrow) characteristic of apoptotic nuclei. The absence of cortical actin at 20 APF hours is accompanied by the formation of actin aggregates found in dying cells in wild-type (arrowhead). (C) Breakdown of the lamina in EAST-GFP expressing cells. The nuclear lamina labeled by nuclear Lamin antibody (red) disintegrates between 14 and 19&nbsp;h APF. However, the organization of polytene chromosomes remains intact. Differential interference contrast (DIC) also suggests a breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Smaller nuclei in the vicinity of giant nucleus are stained by anti-nuclear Lamin (arrow).
