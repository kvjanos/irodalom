Biologists distinguish different mitotic
phases, which correspond in this context to the following observed char-
acteristics:
• Prophase : Fragmentation of the nucleus enveloppe and condensation
of the chromosomes, along with changes in nucleus shape and increased
brightness. There is also a deformation of the cell membrane from
elliptic to spheric.
• Prometaphase : Changes in volume and convexity of nucleus shape.

• Metaphase : Planar arrangement of the chromosomes in the future cell
division plane.
• Anaphase : Separation of the two sets of chromosomes yielding two
nuclei within a single cell membrane.
• Telophase : Membrane constriction in the cell division plane.
• Cytokinesis : Separation of the daughter cells.
