    <h2>
      Mitosis--A General background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mitosis (or the division of threads) is the term used by
      Flemming (1879) to describe the progressive and visible
      structural changes that occur in the cell nucleus as it
      divides--which happens in the adult human approx. 25
      million times every second! Subsequently, the definition of
      mitosis was expanded to also include division of the
      cytoplasm (cytokinesis) which occurs during or just after
      nuclear division. During division of the nucleus
      (karyokinesis) the replicated chromosomes, that contain the
      genetic blueprints (i.e., DNA) for the organism, are
      segregated equally into two daughter cells. Errors in this
      process produce daughter cells containing unequal numbers
      of chromosomes (<em>i.e.,</em> aneuploid cells) that can
      ultimately lead to birth defect syndromes and cancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      During mitosis the cell constructs a transient but
      elaborate bipolar microtubule-based structure, known as the
      spindle, that produces and directs the forces for
      chromosome motion (see picture on home page). The spindle
      is also involved in defining the plane along which the cell
      will ultimately pinch in half (<em>i.e.,</em> the cleavage
      furrow). Spindle formation in vertebrate cells involves an
      interaction between the replicated and separated
      centrosomes, or spindle poles, and the kinetochores---two
      tiny plate-like structures that are located on opposite
      sides of each replicated chromosome. Clearly, in order to
      understand how mitosis works one needs to understand the
      structure, function and composition of centrosomes and
      kinetochores, and how these cellular organelles
      interact---all of which are topics of research in our
      laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the major goals of mitosis research is to define the
      molecular mechanisms responsible for chromosome motion. In
      this context models for this process must be consistent
      with how chromosomes behave in the living cell--and this
      behavior is constantly being redefined as new microscopic
      technologies are developed. In our lab we use
      state-of-the-art light microscopic approaches to define the
      behavior of normal and experimentally manipulated cells,
      and subsequent 3-D electron microscopic approaches to
      determine the structural correlations that underlie this
      behavior.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Cells That We Use In Our Studies.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For our cell-based studies we use material from two
      different vertebrates--and the choice depends primarily on
      the goal of the study. When examining the behavior of
      centrosomes and chromosomes we use <em>Taricha
      granulosa</em> (newt) pulmonary epithelial cells which we
      grow in primary culture from lung explants (see C.L. Rieder
      and R. Hard, Internat. Rev. Cytol., 122:153-220, 1990).
      These hearty cells are the largest in the vertebrate
      kingdom and are the most amenable for high resolution light
      microscopic studies. Because of their size they are not,
      however, particularly fun to work with at the EM level.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      We also use cells from the PtK<sub>1</sub> line (2N = 11)
      which was originally established from a female rat kangaroo
      (<em>Potorous tridactilus)</em> kidney (the PtK<sub>2</sub>
      line, in which 2N = 14, was established from a male rat
      kangaroo kidney). The cells in this line are large, contain
      only 11 chromosomes, and under the proper culture
      conditions they remain flat throughout mitosis. However,
      once grown beyond passage #100 (starting at #62), we throw
      them out and thaw new ones. It is our experience that no
      matter what the culture conditions, PtK<sub>1</sub> cells
      get progressively "sicker" as the line ages
      (something like Hayflick's syndrome). In this context
      the checkpoint control that inhibits anaphase onset in the
      presence of unattached kinetochores (see below), is strong
      in low passage number cultures but it appears to get
      sloppier as the passage number increases past 100.

    </p>
    <p>
      After watching many newt lung and PtK<sub>1</sub> cells
      divide we are convinced that both type of cells, and indeed
      all vertebrate somatic cells, play by the same rules,
      <em>i.e.</em>, there are no discernible differences between
      cells from different vertebrates in how the spindle forms
      or in how the chromosomes behave throughout the division
      process.

    <h2>
      The Centrosome or "Central Body" <span class="c6">(Boveri and Van Beneden, ~1880)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the end of mitosis each cell inherits a single
      centrosome which had defined one of the poles of the former
      spindle. In the non dividing (interphase) cell this
      centrosome organizes an elaborate array of cytoplasmic
      microtubules that are used as roadbeds for transporting
      material.

      surface of one of the newly generated G1 nuclei.

      is in the process of replication. Note that a primary
      cilium is associated with the oldest centriole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In growing cells the centrosome is normally replicated near
      the time of DNA synthesis (when the chromosomes are
      replicated). Obviously, this process is carefully
      controlled because too few or too many centrosomes lead to
      monopolar or multipolar spindles (and aneuploidy). Part of
      our research involves studying the composition and
      structure of centrosomes, how they work, and how their
      numbers are controlled. For the most part these studies are
      conducted on sea urchin zygotes in collaboration with Dr.
      Greenfield Sluder (Worcester Foundation for Biomedical
      Research, Shrewsbury, MA), and in lysates of surf clams
      oocytes in collaboration with Dr. Robert Palazzo (Univ. of
      Kansas, Lawrence). Much of this work is done during the
      summer months at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods
      Hole, MA.

      angles, in our new 400 kV intermediate voltage electron
      microscope. 3-nm is about the thickness of 20 water
      molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once replicated the centrosome acts as a single functional
      unit until the onset of mitosis. During the first visible
      stages of mitosis the replicated chromosomes begin to
      condense within the nucleus. Near the end of this prophase
      stage the two replicated centrosomes begin to separate to
      define the poles of the nascent spindle. This separation is
      coincident with the destruction of cytoplasmic microtubules
      and with the nucleation, by each centrosome, of a robust
      radial array of dynamically unstable microtubules known as
      an aster.

      this dual exposure epi-fluorescent picture, and those that
      follow, the cell was fixed in glutaraldehyde and stained
      for indirect immuno-fluorescent localization of spindle
      microtubules using a antibody to alpha tubulin. The
      chromosomes were stained with Hoechst 33342.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakdown of the nuclear envelope liberates the
      chromosomes into the cytoplasm where they interact, via
      their kinetochores (see below), with the asters to form the
      spindle.

      The Kinetochore <span class="c6">(Sharp, 1939)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time of nuclear envelope breakdown each replicated
      chromosome possesses two sister kinetochores that are
      positioned on opposite sides of the chromosome. These
      kinetochores attach the chromosome to the spindle by
      trapping microtubules growing from the asters. Over time
      each kinetochore acquires a bundle of microtubules, known
      as a kinetochore fiber, that provides a scaffold for
      transmitting and/or producing the forces for poleward
      chromosome motion. Exactly how these forces are generated
      remain to be determined and is another subject of our
      research efforts.

    <p>
      Once both the sister kinetochores become attached to the
      opposing spindle poles the chromosome moves or
      "congresses" to the equator of the forming
      spindle. Again, the mechanism(s) by which the forces are
      produced and balanced during congression remain ambiguous
      and are a subject of our research efforts. Laser
      microsurgery experiments from our laboratory, and that of
      our collaborator Dr. E.D. Salmon (Univ. of North Carolina,
      Chapel Hill), reveal that congressing chromosomes are under
      the influence of two sets of forces. One, known as the
      polar ejection force or "polar wind", acts along
      the length of the chromosome to push it away from the
      closest pole. This force depends on the presence of aster
      and half-spindle microtubules, and its magnitude appears
      positively correlated with microtubule density. We believe
      that it is generated by growing microtubule (+) ends that
      constantly impact on the chromosome arms, but others feel
      that it is mediated by microtubule based molecular
      (kinsein-like) motors that reside along the chromosome
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other force component for congression is pole-directed
      and acts on the kinetochore. It is produced by the
      kinetochore and/or by the kinetochore fiber--but the
      relative contributions of each remain controversial and may
      differ between organisms. Recent experiments from our
      laboratory reveal that when not experiencing a poleward
      directed force, the kinetochore on a congressing chromosome
      exists in a "neutral" state that allows it to
      coast away from its associated pole on the tips of
      elongating kinetochore fiber microtubules (Khodjakov and
      Rieder, 1996). In this manner when one of the kinetochores
      on a congressing chromosome is moving towards its pole, the
      other is coasting away from its pole in response to the
      proximal polar ejection field and the poleward motion of
      its (opposing) sister kinetochore. The stimulus that
      induces kinetochores to switch between poleward and neutral
      states remains to be determine, but it likely involves
      tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dogma of mitosis is that a chromosome must have two
      sister kinetochores in order to congress. Indeed,
      chromosome biorientation, in which the sister kinetochores
      acquire an attachment to the opposing spindle poles, is
      considered to be a prerequisite for and a hallmark of a
      congressing chromosome. However, we have recently shown
      that chromosome fragments that contain only one
      kinetochore, created in living mitotic cells by laser
      microsurgery, often congress (Khodjakov <em>et al</em>.
      ,1997)! This result implies that kinetochores consist of
      multiple identical subunits, that the activity of these
      subunits is independently regulated, and that each contains
      the complete molecular machinery for kinetochore function.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all of the replicated chromosomes become aligned near
      the spindle equator they separate or "disjoin"
      into individual chromatids. These then move towards their
      respective poles in a process known as anaphase. We believe
      that the poleward motion of anaphase chromosomes is likely
      powered by the same mechanism that produces the poleward
      directed forces for congression--but others disagree. It is
      also likely that during this time the polar ejection forces
      diminish, disappear or are redirected.

      Checkpoints Controlling Progress Through the Mitosis
      Portion of the Cell Cycle.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cell cycle is defined as the series of events that
      prepare a growing cell for division. Progress through the
      cell cycle is regulated by a series of "checkpoint
      controls" that slow or arrest the cell cycle until the
      event(s) being monitored are completed. Recently it has
      become evident that progress through the mitosis portion of
      the cell cycle is also regulated by checkpoints and this is
      an area that our laboratory is also actively involved in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vertebrate somatic cells the first mitosis checkpoint
      controls nuclear envelope breakdown and thus entry into
      prometaphase--which represents the first point of no return
      during mitosis. This checkpoint is likely related to the
      RAD 9 checkpoint that arrests the cell cycle in response to
      DNA damage. Nuclei that are excessively irradiated up until
      late prophase return to interphase, but after late prophase
      they proceed into prometaphase regardless of the radiation
      level.

      (6:39) until the damage is repaired
    </p>
    <p>
      Work from our lab, and those of others, demonstrates that
      entry into anaphase (and thus exit from mitosis) is also
      controlled by a checkpoint (<em>see,</em> Rieder <em>et
      al</em>. , 1995). This checkpoint monitors kinetochore
      attachment and a single unattached kinetochore is
      sufficient to inhibit anaphase onset in PtK<sub>1</sub>
      cells for many hours. At present the molecular events
      associated with kinetochore attachment that are monitored
      by this checkpoint are unknown, but they likely involve
      tension at the kinetochore generated as it acquires
      microtubules and begins to experience poleward forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The target of the inhibitory signal released by unattached
      kinetochores is also unknown. However, ongoing work in our
      laboratory on cells containing two independent spindles
      (Rieder <em>et al.,</em> 1997) indicates that this target
      is closely associated with the spindle containing the
      unattached kinetochore.
