Abstract Studies of Drosophila metamorphosis have been hampered by our inability to visualize many of the remarkable changes that occur within the puparium. To circumvent this problem, we have expressed GFP in speciﬁc tissues of living prepupae and pupae and compiled images of these animals into time-lapse movies. These studies reveal, for the ﬁrst time, the dynamics and coordination of morphogenetic movements that could only be inferred from earlier studies of dissected staged animals. We also identify responses that have not been described previously. These include an unexpected variation in some wild-type animals, where one of the ﬁrst pairs of legs elongates in the wrong position relative to the second pair of legs and then relocates to its appropriate location. At later stages, the antennal imaginal discs migrate from a lateral position in the head to their ﬁnal location at the anterior end, as leg and mouth structures are reﬁned and the wings begin to fold. The larval salivary glands translocate toward the dorsal aspect of the animal and undergo massive cell death following head eversion, in synchrony with death of the abdominal muscles. These death responses fail to occur in rbp5 mutants of the Broad-Complex (BR-C), and imaginal disc elongation and eversion is abolished in br5 mutants of the BR-C. Leg malformations associated with the crol3 mutation can be seen to arise from defects in imaginal disc morphogenesis during prepupal stages. This approach provides a new tool for characterizing the dynamic morphological changes that occur during metamorphosis in both wild-type and mutant animals. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Introduction Few biological events have captured the human imagination as much as insect metamorphosis. The transformation of a crawling larva into a highly mobile and sexually reproductive adult insect raises a wide range of biological questions and provides an ideal system for studying developmental timing and terminal differentiation.

ingly, studies of metamorphosis have focused largely on lepidopteran insects, facilitated by their size, well-characterized hormone titers, and the ability to precisely stage their development (Gilbert et al., 1996). Over the past decade, however, our understanding of metamorphosis in the relatively small Dipteran insect, Drosophila melanogaster, has advanced signiﬁcantly as a result of intensive molecular genetic analyses. These studies have provided insights into the molecular basis of metamorphosis, yielding initial clues regarding how hormonal effects on gene expression are transduced into such a remarkable variety of stage- and tissue-speciﬁc biological responses (Richards, 1997; Russell and Ashburner, 1996; Thummel, 1996). In Drosophila, as in all holometabolous insects, metamorphosis is controlled by changes in the titer of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (henceforth referred to as

ecdysone). A high-titer ecdysone pulse at the end of the third larval instar triggers puparium formation, signaling the onset of metamorphosis and the prepupal stage in development (Riddiford, 1993). This is followed by another pulse of ecdysone, approximately 10 –12 h after puparium formation. This prepupal ecdysone pulse triggers pupation, deﬁned by eversion of the adult head, marking the prepupal– pupal transition. Pupal development continues for several days accompanied by a high ecdysone titer, resulting in terminal differentiation of the adult ﬂy. Detailed anatomical and histological studies have revealed many biological changes that occur within the puparium in response to these sequential pulses of ecdysone (Bodenstein, 1965; Robertson, 1936). Most larval tissues are destroyed by programmed cell death in a stage-speciﬁc manner, while new adult tissues and structures develop from small clusters of progenitor cells. The larval midgut is destroyed in early prepupae as islands of imaginal precursor cells proliferate and fuse to form a new adult gut (Bodenstein, 1965; Jiang et al., 1997). The salivary glands are also destroyed, but not until after the prepupal ecdysone pulse, replaced by an adult salivary gland that differentiates from an imaginal ring of cells at the anterior end of the gland (Robertson, 1936). Salivary gland death occurs by autophagy, with DNA fragmentation, formation of autophagic vacuoles, and caspase activation (Lee and Baehrecke, 2001). The larval muscles are also destroyed in a stagespeciﬁc manner, with most anterior muscles destroyed in prepupae and most abdominal muscles destroyed after head eversion (Robertson, 1936). The residual larval muscles act as templates for the formation of adult muscles during pupal development (Bate, 1993; Bodenstein, 1965). Major contractions by the abdominal muscles play a key role in driving the morphogenetic events that accompany pupation (Chadﬁeld and Sparrow, 1985; Robertson, 1936). Sequential pulses of ecdysone are also critical for proper morphogenesis of the adult appendages from the leg and wing imaginal discs (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). These epithelial sheets undergo coordinated changes in cell shape during prepupal development in the absence of proliferation, resulting in initial elongation and eversion of the appendages (Condic et al., 1991; von Kalm et al., 1995). Extensive studies have shown that the late larval ecdysone pulse is required for leg disc elongation and eversion, and the subsequent decrease in ecdysone titer in mid-prepupae is required for pupal cuticle deposition (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). Final elongation and differentiation of the legs and wings is then driven by the prepupal and pupal pulses of ecdysone. Ecdysone exerts its effects on development via hormonetriggered regulatory cascades (Richards, 1997; Russell and Ashburner, 1996; Thummel, 1996). A number of ecdysoneinducible regulatory genes play a key role in controlling larval tissue cell death and/or the formation of adult structures, including the Broad-Complex (BR-C) and crooked legs (crol). The BR-C encodes a family of zinc ﬁnger pro-

teins that function as transcription factors, and is genetically deﬁned by three lethal complementation groups (DiBello et al., 1991; Kiss et al., 1988). The br (broad) and 2Bc functions are required for imaginal disc evagination and fusion, respectively. The rbp (reduced bristles on palpus) function is necessary for the destruction of the larval salivary gland and for the development of speciﬁc adult thoracic muscles (Restifo and White, 1992). crol encodes at least three zinc ﬁnger protein isoforms and crol mutants die during pupal development with defects in head eversion and leg morphogenesis (D’Avino and Thummel, 1998). A major impediment in our understanding of insect metamorphosis has been the difﬁculty in visualizing changes that occur within the intact puparium. As a result, past researchers have depended on either histological sections or whole-mount analysis of dissected tissues from staged animals. These static images do not convey the speed or coordination of developmental responses to ecdysone during metamorphosis. In addition, more subtle morphogenetic changes may escape detection by these methods. Finally, a means of visualizing speciﬁc responses to ecdysone, such as leg formation or salivary gland cell death, would allow us to easily identify defects in these pathways in mutant animals. Here we describe the use of GFP as a marker to follow the fate of the larval salivary glands, larval muscles, and imaginal discs in intact living animals during the onset of metamorphosis. We show that this system can be used to observe the dynamics of larval tissue cell death as well as the formation of the basic body plan of the adult insect. We also show that this system can be used in different mutant backgrounds to study how speciﬁc mutant phenotypes arise in ecdysone-triggered developmental pathways.

Materials and methods Drosophila strains Fly stocks were maintained at room temperature on standard cornmeal molasses medium. 34B-GAL4 (P{GawB}34B) is on the second chromosome and was used to express GFP in the larval salivary glands (Bloomington stock no. 1967). 24B-GAL4 (P{GawB}how24B) is on the third chromosome and was used to express GFP in the larval muscles (Bloomington stock no. 1767). Dll-GAL4 (P{GawB}Dllmd23) is on the second chromosome and was used to express GFP in the distal portion of the imaginal discs and adult appendages (Bloomington stock no. 3038). The Dll-GAL4 and 24BGAL4 drivers also show some expression in the larval salivary glands. Two UAS-GFP reporter stocks were used: P{UAS-GFP.S65T}T2 (Bloomington stock no. 1521) and P{UAS-GFP.S65T}T10 (Bloomington stock no. 1522). For GFP studies in mutant animals, GAL4 drivers and GFP reporters were introduced into different mutant backgrounds using appropriate crosses. crol3 is a strong hypomorphic

allele (D’Avino and Thummel, 2000). The Dll-GAL4 driver was recombined onto the crol3 chromosome for visualizing imaginal discs in a crol mutant background. br5 is a null allele and rbp5 is a strong hypomorphic allele for these two lethal complementation groups of the BR-C (Belyaeva et al., 1980, 1982; Kiss et al., 1988). Imaging of GFP expression in living animals Late third instar larvae were selected from the appropriate crosses and monitored every 10 –15 min for pupariation. A wild-type animal (usually mutant allele/balancer) was selected for each mutant study at the same stage of development to provide an internal control for developmental timing. Movies of muscle and imaginal discs were started at an early prepupal stage, while salivary gland movies were started in late prepupae. Because salivary gland glue can give background ﬂuorescence, a moist paintbrush was used to remove the glue from the surface of the animal before positioning it for microscopy. Staged prepupae were placed on a glass microscope slide covered with a piece of white or black ﬁlter paper. The slide was placed in a humid chamber to maintain viability. This chamber was comprised of a glass petri dish containing an elevated glass slide supported by glass blocks. Water was added to the bottom of the petri dish and ﬁlter paper strips were used to wick water from the bottom of the chamber to the slide. The chamber was covered with a plastic petri dish cover with a 2-cm hole bored in the middle, directly over the animals. Animals were maintained at ambient temperature in the room, 22–27°C. Head eversion occurred at 11–13 h after puparium formation in wild-type animals and was delayed by several hours in mutants, as described previously (D’Avino and Thummel, 1998; Karim et al., 1993). A Zeiss Axiophot microscope modiﬁed for digital imaging was used to capture epiﬂuorescence time-lapse images of animals expressing GFP in Figs. 1– 4, 6, and 7. The modiﬁcations included stage (X–Y) and focus (Z) controls, shutter control, ﬁlter wheel, a SensiCamQE high-performance digital CCD camera, and Slidebook 3.0 on a Macintosh G4 computer. Time-lapse images were captured using the following parameters: 2.5 /0.075 Plan-neoﬂuar objective, UV light (528 nm), 2 2 binning (640 512 pixels ﬁnal), 300- to 2500-ms exposures (images of mutants that carry only one copy of the transgenes required longer exposure times), 50 –300 time points at 10- or 20-min intervals. For salivary gland movies, we used multipoint visitation to simultaneously capture images from multiple animals. For muscle movies, we used a 4D capture protocol to obtain several focal planes, from which one was selected to generate the movies (3– 6 Z sections at 50 m steps for each time point). Long-term exposure ( 2 days) to brief bursts of UV light had no apparent effect on viability or development. A Zeiss Axioplan microscope attached to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser was used to image GFP expres-

sion in imaginal discs in Figs. 5 and 8, using a Zeiss 2.5 objective. An argon laser was used with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 527 nm. Using the equation Rd 1.4n0 /NA2, where Rd is the depth resolution (in nm), n0 is the refractive index of the medium (1.0), is the excitation wavelength, and NA is the numerical aperture of the lens (0.075), we calculate that the depth resolution of our scans is approximately 0.12 mm. This would cover approximately 15% of the depth of a pupa, which is less than 1 mm in diameter. Laser power was set at 10% and images were captured with Kalman averaging N 2. An automated timed series of images were collected using either 600-s (10 min) or 900-s (15-min) intervals for a total of 71–121 images. The laser scans had no effect on the development of wild-type animals, all of which eclosed normally. The box size for each collection was set to 640 480 to have the images in NTSC format, ready for video transfer. The images were stored on a OS/2 driven Dell 2300 computer. Image processing and video transfer Images from the digital camera on the Axiophot were exported from SlideBook 3.0 as a series of individual TIFF ﬁles. Each TIFF ﬁle in a sequence was adjusted, and times were added (h:min), using Adobe Photoshop. These modiﬁed images were imported into Adobe Premier and exported as a QuickTime movie. Images from the confocal microscope were exported using Bio-Rad LaserSharp processing software as a series of individual Apple PICT ﬁles. Text depicting the time (h:min) was added to each image and the Video:NTSC color ﬁlter was used to prepare each image for video, using Adobe Photoshop. This series was imported into Adobe Premier and exported as a QuickTime movie. Selected images from each movie were used to generate the ﬁgures in Adobe Photoshop.

Results Destruction of the larval salivary glands and muscles in early pupae The 34B-GAL4 driver was used to express GFP in the larval salivary glands. Animals were collected as newly formed prepupae, aged for 6 –9 h at 25°C, and images were collected at 10-min intervals until 21–25 h after puparium formation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, the large lobes of the larval salivary glands can be easily visualized along the ventral surface of the animal prior to head eversion (12:00). The glands contract slightly, then rapidly move toward the dorsal region of the animal as the head everts, with only the most anterior portion of the gland remaining in focus. GFP ﬂuorescence gradually diminishes with only a faint signal visible by 8 h after head eversion (20:00). A lateral view of the salivary glands, shown in Fig. 1B, more clearly illustrates the sudden movement of the

salivary glands toward the dorsal aspect of the animal at head eversion. This is followed by a slight contraction and gradual dissolution of the glands. See Online supplementary data for Quicktime movies of Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B. Similar responses were observed in six different animals. The larval muscles in the abdomen have been reported to be destroyed in synchrony with the salivary glands, in early pupae (Robertson, 1936). To visualize this response, the 24B-GAL4 driver was used to express GFP in the larval muscles, and images were collected at 20-min intervals through prepupal and early pupal development. The characteristic array of larval muscles can be seen in the prepupal abdomen (Fig. 2, 2:00, 10:00). The muscles begin to break up and become disorganized about 2 h before head eversion (Fig. 2, see boxed region in 10:00 –12:00). Muscles are still evident at early times after head eversion (Fig. 2, 12:20, 12:40), followed by their rapid dissolution until the individual muscles are no longer seen (Fig. 2, 14:20, 16:20). See

Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 2. Similar responses were observed in three different animals. We also attempted to visualize the destruction of the anterior larval muscles in these animals, which occurs during the ﬁrst half of prepupal development (Robertson, 1936). Clear images of these muscles, however, could not be obtained, despite numerous attempts. One reason for this is that the 24B-GAL4 driver, as well as e22c-GAL4 and rp298-GAL4 (Menon and Chia, 2001), all of which are muscle-speciﬁc in embryos, gave more nonspeciﬁc GFP expression in prepupae. It was thus difﬁcult to detect the larval muscles above the background ﬂuorescence. This was compounded by the contraction of the early prepupa which occurs shortly after puparium formation, shifting the anterior larval muscles into a wide range of focal planes. In contrast, the abdominal larval muscles, as viewed from the ventral surface, remain within a relatively narrow focal plane and thus can be readily visualized as they progress through cell death (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Destruction of the larval abdominal muscles. Images were collected at 20-min intervals from the ventral side of a 2-h prepupa that carries the 24B-GAL4 driver and UAS-GFP reporter. A z-series stack of six images was collected for each time point and one section was selected from each stack to create the time-lapse movie in Online supplementary data. Representative images from this movie are depicted, with the corresponding times shown below in hours:minutes. The boxed region highlights larval muscles that degenerate prior to head eversion.

Larval salivary glands and muscles fail to die in rbp5 mutants To determine how effectively the GAL4/GFP system could be used to analyze defects in the destruction of larval tissues during metamorphosis, we followed the fate of the larval salivary glands and abdominal muscles in rbp5 mutants of the BR-C. Although these mutants display a high

penetrance of salivary gland cell death defects, the effects of this mutation on larval muscle cell death have not been reported (Jiang et al., 2000; Restifo and White, 1992; Zhimulev et al., 1995). The 34B-GAL4 driver and UAS-GFP responder were introduced into an rbp5 mutant background to follow salivary gland cell fate. Images were collected at 10-min intervals from mutant late prepupae until 9 h after head ever-

These were compiled into a time-lapse movie that can be seen as Online supplementary data. Representative images from this movie are depicted. A control wild-type pupa is shown on the right (wt) for comparison. Head eversion is delayed by 3 h in the rbp5 mutant prepupa relative to the wild-type, thus the wild-type 21:00 image is equivalent in developmental time to the 24:00 mutant timepoint.

sion. Fig. 3 shows that the larval salivary glands look normal during prepupal development, with one gland moving on top of the other in this animal (14:50). The glands then dive at head eversion but do not fall apart and there is little, if any, reduction in GFP ﬂuorescence throughout the time course (Fig. 3, 24:00). In contrast, a control wild-type animal shows only a low level of residual ﬂuorescence from the salivary glands (Fig. 3, wt 21:00). GFP expression can still be detected in the mutants several days after head eversion (data not shown). See Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 3. A similar phenotype was observed in dozens of rbp5 mutant animals. The 24B-GAL4 driver and UAS-GFP responder were crossed into an rbp5 mutant background to follow abdominal muscle cell fate. Images were collected at 20-min intervals from mutant animals, starting at 2– 8 h and ending at 24 –28 h after puparium formation. Fig. 4 shows the normal array of abdominal muscles in an rbp5 mutant prepupa, with a prominent gas bubble appearing after 09:00. The muscle degeneration that is apparent 2 h before head eversion in wild-type prepupae is not seen in the rbp5 mutant animals (Figs. 2 and 4, boxed regions), although the muscles appear less organized than at earlier stages. Similarly, intact muscles can be seen after head eversion in rbp5 mutant pupae, more than 1 day after puparium formation (Fig. 4, arrows). Signiﬁcant muscle contractions are apparent in early rbp5 mutant pupae, starting at head eversion (13:20 in the animal in Fig. 4) and continuing for as long as 5 h, consistent with the ability of the persistent muscles to remain active. Muscle contractions in wild-type animals are only evident for 2.7– 3.0 h after head eversion (n 5). See Online supplementary

data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 4. Similar phenotypes were observed in ﬁve different rbp5 mutant animals. The imaginal discs undergo rapid and coordinate morphogenesis We used Dll-GAL4 to drive GFP expression in the imaginal discs of newly formed prepupae as a ﬁrst step toward observing the dynamics of adult tissue development during metamorphosis. Images were collected from wild-type animals at 15-min intervals through prepupal and early pupal development and compiled to form a movie. As viewed from a ventral perspective, the legs become visible in a reproducible order as they elongate within the puparium. The second pair of legs (T2 legs) are already elongated and visible in a newly formed prepupa (Fig. 5, 00:00). The ﬁrst (T1) and third (T3) pair of legs elongate in synchrony with the second pair; however, the T1 legs are initially buried underneath the T2 legs and the T3 legs are located laterally. The T1 legs move in an anterior direction, out from underneath the T2 legs, and become visible between 03:00 and 04:00 (Fig. 5). One leg in each pair often overlaps the other at ﬁrst and then moves laterally to assume its normal position next to the other (this can be seen for the T2 legs in Fig. 5, 00:00 and 03:00). The third pair of legs come into view last, between 04:30 and 06:00, moving from their initial lateral location toward the ventral region of the animal. Starting at 05:00, the legs bend back upon themselves as they begin the process of eversion. The legs then fold back further and evert rapidly, moving outside the puparium between 05:30 and 05:45. The wings elongate laterally and

Fig. 5. Imaginal disc morphogenesis and head eversion establish the basic body plan of the adult ﬂy. Images were collected at 15-min intervals from the ventral side of a 0-h prepupa that carries the Dll-GAL4 driver and UAS-GFP reporter. These images were compiled into a time-lapse movie that can be seen as Online supplementary data. Representative images from this movie are depicted, with the corresponding times shown below in hours:minutes. The arrows at 06:00 mark the everted wings. Salivary glands can be seen throughout most of prepupal development.

ﬁrst become visible, from a ventral perspective, between 05:00 and 06:00 (Fig. 5, 06:00, arrows). The legs do not appear to undergo further elongation between 06:00 and 09:00 and form an ordered regular array along the ventral surface of the animal. The wings continue to elongate along the lateral sides of the animal between 06:00 and 08:00.

From 09:00 to 10:30, the legs undergo a second, more minor, step in their elongation. Head eversion occurs between 13:00 and 13:15 in Fig. 5. The eye-antennal imaginal discs rapidly rotate out to the sides of the everting adult head as the mouthparts begin to form (Fig. 5, 13:00, 13:15). In addition, the legs straighten and, together with the wings,

396

R.E. Ward et al. / Developmental Biology 256 (2003) 389 – 402

undergo a ﬁnal signiﬁcant elongation between 13:00 and 13:15. By 15:00, the basic body plan of the adult ﬂy has been established (Fig. 5). See Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 5. Similar responses were observed in dozens of wild-type animals. We noted an unusual variation that occurred in 14% of wild-type animals (ﬁve experiments with sample sizes of 9–29 animals per experiment) where one of the T1 legs moves out on the wrong side of a T2 leg shortly after puparium formation. This can be seen in a second movie of wild-type animals where images were captured at 10-min intervals from 00:00 to 50:00 h relative to puparium formation (Fig. 6). As the T1 legs begin to move out in an anterior direction from underneath the T2 legs, one of the T1 legs moves out on the wrong side of its corresponding T2 leg (Fig. 6, 03:30, arrow), rather than between the pair of T2 legs as is seen in the majority of wild-type animals (Fig. 5, 04:00). The T1 leg then moves back underneath the T2 leg to assume its appropriate location next to its partner (Fig. 6, 04:20– 05:00, arrow). This movement is always complete immediately before disc eversion, which occurs at 05:10 – 05:20 in this animal. Continuing this movie from head eversion until 50 h after puparium formation reveals remarkable reﬁnement of the imaginal disc-derived adult cuticular structures. Dll expression in the eye-antennal disc marks only the antennal portion, revealing a slow migration of these structures from an initial lateral position on the head to their appropriate ﬁnal location at the anterior end of the puparium by 12 h after head eversion (Fig. 6, 11:00–23:30). This movement has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously. As the antennal discs complete their migration, the legs reveal their segmented structure. This continues through the end of the time course, as the mouthparts become reﬁned. Folds can also be seen to form within the developing wings during the ﬁnal 10 h of the time course (Fig. 6, arrows, 41:00– 47:10). See Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 6. Similar responses were observed in three wild-type animals. br5 and crol3 mutants display defective adult leg morphogenesis Earlier studies have shown that br5 and crol3 mutations result in leg malformations that can be detected during prepupal and early pupal development (Kiss et al., 1988; D’Avino and Thummel, 1998). We have examined the origin of these phenotypes in living animals using the DllGAL4 driver and UAS-GFP reporter in br5 and crol3 mutant backgrounds (Figs. 7 and 8). In agreement with earlier studies (Kiss et al., 1988), the br5 mutation results in a complete block in leg morphogenesis, with no eversion or elongation (Fig. 7). The leg discs move around slowly in these animals, but show no developmental changes. These animals undergo a series of contractions beginning at 16:00 and increasing in intensity between 18:00 and 19:00 that appear to reﬂect an attempt at head eversion. One leg imaginal disc is often forced away from the others by these

contractions (Fig. 7, 18:00 –19:00). Similar strain variations have been reported in the timing of the prepupal ecdysone pulse that triggers these muscle contractions (Richards, 1981). See Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 7. Similar responses were observed in ﬁve different movies generated from this genotype. crol3 mutants also display defects in leg disc morphogenesis (Fig. 8). The T1 and T2 legs appear at the proper times relative to wild-type. Interestingly, however, all four crol3 mutants examined revealed initial mislocalization of one T1 leg, as reported above for a minority of wild-type prepupae (Fig. 8, 02:50 – 03:50, arrow). Figure 8 represents the least severe mutant examined; the other three crol3 mutants more closely displayed the degree of T1 movement depicted in Fig. 6. The T2 legs begin to fold at 04:30. The T3 legs appear between 05:40 and 08:00, as the legs evert to the outside, revealing a 1 to 2-h delay in disc eversion relative to wild-type. crol3 mutant legs also fail to form the clearly ordered array that is evident upon completion of eversion in wild-type prepupae and they undergo no signiﬁcant elongation after 08:00 (Fig. 8). As a result, the ﬁnal leg elongation that occurs at head eversion, which is delayed in crol3 mutants to between 15:30 and 16:00 (Fig. 8), results in legs that are signiﬁcantly shorter than those seen in wild-type pupae (Fig. 8, 20:00, arrow). The legs are also malformed at this stage, with one of the third legs wrapped around the edge of the wing (Fig. 8, 20:00, arrowhead) (see also Fig. 2B, D’Avino and Thummel, 1998). See Online supplementary data for a Quicktime movie of Fig. 8. Similar responses were observed in four crol3 mutant animals.

Discussion The past 15 years have seen major strides forward in our understanding of the genetic regulation of Drosophila embryogenesis and pattern formation. In contrast, our understanding of metamorphosis remains relatively poor. In large part, this disparity can be attributed to our inability to see the remarkable morphogenetic changes that occur within the puparium. Here, we show that tissue-speciﬁc expression of GFP can be used to follow the fates of different tissues in living animals during the early stages of Drosophila metamorphosis. We have also used this method to gain insight into the origin of lethal phenotypes associated with mutations in ecdysone-inducible regulatory genes. This approach provides a new means of studying the temporal coordination of key developmental events associated with insect metamorphosis. Visualization of larval salivary gland and muscle cell death during metamorphosis Prior to this report, our understanding of larval salivary gland cell death was derived from end-point analysis, by either dissecting or sectioning staged pupae. These studies

imaging shows a gradual reduction in GFP ﬂuorescence after the glands shift away from the ventral surface of the animal at head eversion, with signal still evident several

hours after the glands can no longer be dissected (Fig. 1, 18:00). It is not until 20 h after puparium formation when GFP levels become signiﬁcantly reduced. It is likely that this gradual decrease in signal derives from GFP protein that is slowly degraded within the dying salivary gland. Dissection of staged pupae revealed that the GFP-expressing salivary glands fall apart when removed from animals older than 16 h after puparium formation. Thus, the GFP ﬂuorescence marks the remnants of this tissue within the animal, allowing us to visualize them at later stages than

otherwise possible. Our imaging also reveals a dramatic translocation of the salivary glands toward the dorsal region of the animal at head eversion, a movement that has not been described previously and that would be difﬁcult to see with other methods of analysis. It is likely that this translocation is a passive response to the major movements that accompany adult head eversion. Larval muscle cell death has not been studied as extensively as that of the salivary glands because it is so difﬁcult to visualize. The muscles can only be seen in sections or by

carefully opening the pupal case that surrounds the puparium. The GAL4/GFP system allows us, for the ﬁrst time, to follow the dynamics of larval muscle cell death in a living animal. Our observations correspond well with earlier studies. As described by Crossley (1978), the abdominal muscles are “decimated” beginning at pupation. Robertson (1936) reports that these muscles show distinct signs of degeneration immediately after pupation, with many broken up within the body cavity by 2 h later. This agrees with the rapid breakdown of muscles that we see immediately after head eversion (Fig. 2). In addition, we see clear indications of a loss of abdominal muscle integrity starting approximately 2 h before head eversion (Fig. 2, boxes). The long muscles begin to fragment and break apart during this time. This was not reported in earlier studies, although Robertson (1936) refers to “slight liquifaction” of the doomed abdominal muscles during prepupal stages. The abdominal muscles must still be capable of exerting signiﬁcant force at pupation, despite their partial degeneration. Rhythmic contractions by the abdominal muscles move a gas bubble that forms in mid-prepupae toward the posterior end of the animal and then along the sides to the anterior end (Chadﬁeld and Sparrow, 1985; Robertson, 1936). This translocation pushes the animal to the posterior region of the puparium, providing space at the anterior end for the future adult head. Major muscle contractions then force the head to evert from within the thoracic sac, to occupy its ﬁnal location at the anterior end of the animal. Several studies have concluded that this morphogenetic movement is driven by hydrostatic pressure, caused by the abdominal muscles forcing hemolymph into the developing head capsule (Bodenstein, 1965; Chadﬁeld and Sparrow, 1985; Robertson, 1936; Wahl, 1914). Immediately after these contractions, the abdominal muscles die. We also examined the effects of the BR-C rbp5 mutation on larval muscle and salivary gland cell death. Consistent with earlier studies (Jiang et al., 2000; Restifo and White, 1992; Zhimulev et al., 1995), the salivary glands fail to die in rbp5 mutants (Fig. 3). Similarly, degeneration of the abdominal muscles that is apparent immediately before head eversion in wild-type animals is not seen in rbp5 mutants (Figs. 2 and 4, boxed regions), and intact larval muscles that extend along the abdomen can be detected beyond 24 h after puparium formation (Fig. 4, arrows), a phenotype that is never observed in wild-type animals. Interestingly, the persistent abdominal muscles in rbp5 mutant pupae continue to contract for up to 5 h after head eversion, indicating that they remain functional. This observation also suggests that the rapid disintegration of wildtype abdominal muscles immediately after head eversion may be a consequence of their self-destruction, with the muscles tearing themselves apart as their cells undergo programmed cell death. We conclude that the BR-C plays a critical role in larval abdominal muscle cell death during metamorphosis.

Ecdysone pulses coordinate major morphogenetic changes that form the basic body plan of the adult ﬂy Our studies reveal a remarkable series of rapid and coordinated morphogenetic responses to the late larval and prepupal pulses of ecdysone. The legs can be followed during their elongation, initially within the puparium and later everting to the outside where they undergo ﬁnal stages of elongation and differentiation. The overlapping T1 and T2 legs that we see in early wild-type prepupae as well as the movement of the T1 legs relative to the T2 legs have not been reported previously, revealing the dynamics of imaginal disc morphogenesis triggered by the late larval pulse of ecdysone. It is important to note that this movement represents only the distal portion of the leg, reﬂecting the pattern of Dll-GAL4 expression in the tarsal and distal tibia of the leg (Cohen, 1993). We assume that the more proximal region of the leg discs are relatively static at this stage, undergoing fusion to form part of the adult thorax (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). It should be noted, however, that Usui and Simpson (2000) have reported that wild-type wing imaginal discs move dorsally after eversion, prior to spreading and fusing along the midline. The discs may thus be capable of limited movement, ensuring that they will occupy their appropriate position in the animal prior to their ﬁnal morphogenesis and differentiation. We ﬁnd that leg disc eversion occurs within a 10- to 20-min interval at 5.5– 6 h after puparium formation, in agreement with earlier observations (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993; Robertson, 1936). This is preceded by signiﬁcant folding of the elongating legs inside the animal, which is evident for 30 – 45 min before eversion. This most likely arises from the contracting peripodial epithelium which eventually pushes the elongating legs through the disc stalk to the outside of the puparium (Milner et al., 1984). Both leg elongation and peripodial epithelial contraction occur by ecdysone-triggered changes in cell shape which drive morphogenesis (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). The Dll-GAL4 driver allows us to follow the dynamics of adult head eversion in an intact living animal. This response occurs immediately after the ecdysone pulse that deﬁnes the end of prepupal development, at 13 h after pupariation in the animal shown in Fig. 5. Head eversion has been reported to occur in less than 15 min (Chadﬁeld and Sparrow, 1985; Robertson, 1936), a time frame that is in close agreement with our observations. The most dramatic manifestation of this response is the rapid translocation of the eye-antennal imaginal discs from their larval position to a lateral location in the adult head. The imaginal discs that comprise the adult head must fuse during prepupal development to allow a uniﬁed response to the muscular contractions that drive head eversion. This fusion most likely occurs during mid-prepupal stages, in parallel with fusion of the thoracic imaginal discs (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). Following the animal through later stages of pupal

400

development reveals that the antennae slowly move along the head to assume their ﬁnal location at the anterior end of the puparium, while the mouthparts are reﬁned (Fig. 6). The legs and wings undergo rapid and dramatic elongation at head eversion, increasing signiﬁcantly in length, establishing their adult form (Figs. 5 and 6). This process is reported to occur in a manner similar to that of head eversion, in which the discs are inﬂated by hydrostatic pressure in response to strong abdominal muscle contractions (Fristrom and Fristrom, 1993). The length and form of the ﬁnal adult structures are then ﬁxed in place by deposition of a rigid cuticle. As a result of these coordinated responses, the animal assumes the basic plan of the adult ﬂy, with a head, thorax, abdomen, wings, and legs. Final differentiation occurs over the ensuing days of pupal development as the legs acquire their adult form and the wings become folded (Fig. 6). Adult legs fail to evert and elongate normally in br5 and crol3 mutant prepupae We have used the Dll-GAL4 driver to follow the dynamics of leg imaginal disc morphogenesis in living br5 and crol3 mutant prepupae (Figs. 7 and 8). Our observations conﬁrm and extend earlier phenotypic studies of these mutants. br5 mutants display a complete arrest in leg morphogenesis with no signs of eversion or elongation (Fig. 7), consistent with earlier work (Kiss et al., 1988). Unexpectedly, these animals show a series of apparent muscular contractions at 18 h after pupariation, reﬂecting an aberrant attempt at head eversion and conﬁrming that the animals are still alive at these later stages (Fig. 7). We also often see one leg imaginal disc aberrantly forced away from the others by these contractions, consistent with the known inability of these discs to fuse properly during prepupal development (Kiss et al., 1988). crol3 mutants are also characterized by defects in adult leg morphogenesis (D’Avino and Thummel, 1998). Leg discs were dissected from 6-h crol3 mutant prepupae in an effort to understand the origins of this phenotype, revealing that they are often distorted and reduced in length at this early stage in their development (D’Avino and Thummel, 1998). This effect is seen in movies of crol3 mutant prepupae, although we can also discern several other defects in leg morphogenesis. One of the T1 legs moves to the wrong position relative to its corresponding T2 leg in all four crol3 mutants examined, suggesting an increase in the penetrance of this phenotype that is normally seen in only 14% of wild-type animals. crol3 mutant legs also display a 1- to 2-h delay in disc eversion, fail to form an organized array along the ventral surface as is seen in wild-type mid-prepupae, and fail to undergo elongation in late prepupal stages. As a result of these defects, crol3 mutant legs do not straighten or elongate properly at head eversion (Figs. 5 and 8). The movies thus provide a detailed and dynamic understanding of the origins of the leg malformation caused by crol mutations.

GAL4-mediated GFP expression provides a new method for observing developmental changes in living animals undergoing metamorphosis Earlier studies of Drosophila metamorphosis have depended on static images obtained by dissecting or sectioning staged prepupae and pupae. In contrast, the automated capture of ﬂuorescent GFP images allows us to follow the dynamics of ecdysone-triggered developmental responses in living animals during metamorphosis. This approach reveals the speed and coordination of these events in both wild-type and mutant genetic backgrounds. For example, the rapid dorsal translocation of the larval salivary glands at head eversion has not been reported previously, most likely because it is difﬁcult to follow the fate of this fragile dying tissue without the noninvasive approach of GFP imaging. Similarly, the Dll-GAL4/GFP expression patterns during prepupal and pupal stages dramatically convey the morphogenetic changes that occur as the animal converts its body plan from that of a crawling larva to an adult ﬂy. Although many of these events have been described as early as Robertson’s classic study in 1936, some have not. Moreover, the GFP movies reveal the beauty of these responses as well as uncover subtleties that would otherwise be missed. The noninvasive nature of this method also provides a more accurate characterization of mutant phenotypes than is otherwise possible. For example, although the rbp5 mutation results in persistent larval salivary glands that can be easily dissected from pupae many hours after head eversion, persistent glands in other mutant backgrounds are often fragile, making them difﬁcult to score. The GAL4/GFP system provides a rapid and simple means of visualizing salivary glands in an intact animal, allowing one to easily score large numbers of animals for salivary gland death defects. Similarly, we have found it difﬁcult to characterize defects in leg morphogenesis during prepupal development by more conventional approaches. Simply dissecting and mounting prepupal leg imaginal discs can often result in malformations, even in wild-type animals (J. Gates, unpublished results). Thus, it has been difﬁcult to determine how a leg malformation that is evident in early pupae might have arisen during prepupal stages. The GAL4/GFP system provides a rapid and simple means of determining the origins of leg malformations, as well as revealing subtle mutant phenotypes such as the asynchrony of leg eversion and translocation of the T1 legs. Several technical considerations, however, must be kept in mind when using this method. Visualization by confocal microscopy is only useful when a relatively narrow depth of focus is of interest. Thus, for example, the destruction of the larval salivary glands cannot be followed by confocal microscopy because this tissue dives toward the dorsal side of the puparium at head eversion. In contrast, imaginal disc eversion and elongation, which occurs along the ventral surface of the animal, can be clearly visualized under the confocal microscope. In addition, the GAL4 drivers selected

for this method need to be expressed at relatively high levels, particularly when attempting to visualize tissues that lie deep within the body. This allows one to use rapid shutter speeds, minimizing exposure of the animal to UV or laser light and providing sharp images. The drivers also need to be highly tissue speciﬁc at the stages of interest, reducing background ﬂuorescence. It will be interesting to expand this study to follow other morphogenetic responses during metamorphosis—for example, dorsal closure of the thorax or histoblast development. Combined with optimized GFP reporters, these drivers could reveal new developmental pathways and dynamic responses that had not been previously detectable. Finally, the GAL4/GFP system provides a new approach to design genetic screens for defects in speciﬁc ecdysonetriggered developmental pathways. Individual tissues can be readily observed in living animals by simply rolling vials under a dissecting microscope equipped to detect GFP ﬂuorescence. For example, we currently have a screen underway using salivary gland-speciﬁc GFP expression to score for defects in steroid-triggered programmed cell death (A. Bashirullah, unpublished results). Similar screens could be designed for defects in other ecdysone-regulated developmental responses. Taken together, the use of the GAL4 system to drive GFP expression during metamorphosis should provide a valuable new tool for deﬁning the molecular mechanisms that regulate this critical transition in the insect life cycle.
