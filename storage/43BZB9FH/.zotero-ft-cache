Small silencing RNAs: an expanding universe
Megha Ghildiyal and Phillip D. Zamore

Abstract | Since the discovery in 1993 of the first small silencing RNA, a dizzying number of small RNA classes have been identified, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These classes differ in their biogenesis, their modes of target regulation and in the biological pathways they regulate. There is a growing realization that, despite their differences, these distinct small RNA pathways are interconnected, and that small RNA pathways compete and collaborate as they regulate genes and protect the genome from external and internal threats.
The defining features of small silencing RNAs are their short length (~20–30 nucleotides), and their association with members of the Argonaute family of proteins, which they guide to their regulatory targets, typically resulting in reduced expression of target genes. Beyond these defining features, different small RNA classes guide diverse and complex schemes of gene regulation. Some small silencing RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), derive from dsRNA, whereas others, such as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), do not. These different classes of regulatory RNAs also differ in the proteins required for their biogenesis, the constitution of the Argonaute-containing complexes that execute their regulatory functions, their modes of gene regulation and the biological functions in which they participate. New small RNA classes and new examples of existing classes continue to be discovered, such as the recent identification of endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) in flies and mammals. Here, we provide an overview of small silencing RNAs from plants and metazoan animals. For each class, we describe its biogenesis, function and mode of target regulation, providing examples of the regulatory networks in which each participates (TABLE 1). Finally, we highlight several examples of unexpected, and often unexplained, complexity in the interactions between distinct small RNA pathways. both plants and nematodes, spreading from cell to cell2. In C. elegans, RNAi is also heritable: silencing can be transferred to the progeny of the worm that was originally injected with the trigger dsRNA3. Viral infection, inverted-repeat transgenes or aberrant transcription products all lead to the production of dsRNA. dsRNA is converted to siRNAs that direct RNAi. siRNAs were discovered in plants4 and were later shown in animal extracts to serve as guides that direct endonucleolytic cleavage of their target RNAs5,6. siRNAs can be classified according to the proteins involved in their biogenesis, their mode of regulation or their size. In this Review, we differentiate the major types of siRNAs according to the molecules that trigger their production — a classification scheme that best captures the biological distinctions among small silencing RNAs. siRNAs derived from exogenous agents. Early examples of RNAi were triggered by exogenous dsRNA. In these cases, long exogenous dsRNA is cleaved into doublestranded siRNAs by Dicer, a dsRNA-specific RNase III family ribonuclease7 (FIG. 1). siRNA duplexes produced by Dicer comprise two ~21 nucleotide strands, each bearing a 5′ phosphate and 3′ hydroxyl group, paired in a way that leaves two-nucleotide overhangs at the 3′ ends5,8,9. The strand that directs silencing is called the guide, whereas the other strand, which is ultimately destroyed, is the passenger. Target regulation by siRNAs is mediated by the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC), which is the generic name for an Argonaute–small RNA complex 6. In addition to an Argonaute protein and a small RNA guide, the RISC might also contain auxiliary proteins that extend or modify its function; for example, proteins that redirect the target mRNA to a site of general mRNA degradation10.

Argonaute
Argonaute proteins are the effectors of small RNA-directed silencing. Small RNAs guide Argonautes to their RNA targets; Argonautes carry out the regulation. Argonaute proteins are characterized by two domains — Piwi (a ribonuclease domain) and PAZ (a ssRNA-binding module).

The discovery of RNAi In 1998, Fire and Mello established dsRNA as the silencing trigger in Caenorhabditis elegans1. Their experiments overturned the contemporary view that antisense RNA induced silencing by base pairing to its mRNA counterpart, thereby preventing its translation into protein. In worms and other animals, siRNA-mediated silencing is known as RNAi. Remarkably, RNAi is systemic in

Mammals and C. elegans each have a single Dicer that makes both microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs11–14, whereas Drosophila species have two Dicers: DCR-1 makes miRNAs, whereas DCR-2 is specialized for siRNA production15. The fly RNAi pathway defends against viral infection, and Dicer specialization might reduce competition for Dicer between precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and viral dsRNAs. Alternatively, DCR-2 and Argonaute2 (AGo2) specialization might reflect the evolutionary pressure on the siRNA pathway to counter rapidly evolving viral strategies to escape RNAi. In fact, dcr‑2 and ago2 are among the most rapidly evolving Drosophila genes16. C. elegans might achieve similar specialization with a single Dicer by using the dsRNA-binding protein RNAi defective (RDE-4) as the gatekeeper for entry into the RNAi pathway 17. However, no natural virus infection has been documented in C. elegans 18. By contrast, mammals might not use the RNAi pathway to respond to viral infection, having evolved an elaborate, protein-based immune system19–21. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of the 5′ ends of the two siRNA strands in the duplex determines the identity of the guide and passenger strands22–24. In flies, this thermodynamic difference is sensed by the dsRNAbinding protein R2D2, the partner of DCR-2 and a component of the RISC loading complex (RlC)25,26. The RlC recruits AGo2, to which it transfers the siRNA

duplex. AGo2 can then cleave the passenger strand as if it were a target RNA 27–31. AGo2 always cleaves its RNA target at the phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides that are paired to nucleotides 10 and 11 of the guide strand8,9. Release of the passenger strand after its cleavage converts pre-RISC to mature RISC, which contains only single-stranded guide RNA. In flies, the guide strand is 2′-O-methylated at its 3′ end by the S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase HEN1 (also known as piRNA methyltransferase, PIMET), completing RISC assembly 32,33. In plants, both miRNAs and siRNAs are terminally methylated, a modification that is crucial for their stability 34–36. Plants exhibit a surprising diversity of small RNA types and the proteins that generate them. The diversification of RNA silencing pathways in plants might reflect the need of a sessile organism to cope with biotic and abiotic stress. The number of RNA silencing proteins can vary enormously among animals too, with C. elegans producing 27 distinct Argonaute proteins compared with 5 in flies. Phylogenetic data suggest that nearly all of these ‘extra’ C. elegans Argonautes act in the secondary siRNA pathway37, perhaps because endogenous secondary siRNAs are so plentiful in worms. Arabidopsis thaliana has four Dicer-like (DCl) proteins and 10 Argonautes, with both unique and redundant functions. In plants, inverted-repeat transgenes or coexpressed sense and antisense transcripts produce two

Figure 1 | Small RNA silencing pathways in Drosophila. The three small RNA silencing pathways in flies are the Nature Reviews | Genetics small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways. These pathways differ in their substrates, biogenesis, effector proteins and modes of target regulation. a | dsRNA precursors are processed by Dicer-2 (DCR-2) to generate siRNA duplexes containing guide and passenger strands. DCR-2 and the dsRNA-binding protein R2D2 (which together form the RISC-loading complex, RLC) load the duplex into Argonaute2 (AGO2). A subset of endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) exhibits dependence on dsRNA-binding protein Loquacious (LOQS), rather than on R2D2. The passenger strand is later destroyed and the guide strand directs AGO2 to the target RNA. b | miRNAs are encoded in the genome and are transcribed to yield a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript, which is cleaved by Drosha to yield a short precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Alternatively, miRNAs can be present in introns (termed mirtrons) that are liberated following splicing to yield authentic pre-miRNAs. pre-miRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they are further processed by DCR-1 to generate a duplex containing two strands, miRNA and miRNA*. Once loaded into AGO1, the miRNA strand guides translational repression of target RNAs. c | piRNAs are thought to derive from ssRNA precursors and are made without a dicing step. piRNAs are mostly antisense, but a small fraction is in the sense orientation. Antisense piRNAs are preferentially loaded into Piwi or Aubergine (AUB), whereas sense piRNAs associate with AGO3. The methyltransferase HEN1 adds the 2′-O-methyl modification at the 3′ end. Piwi and AUB collaborate with AGO3 to mediate an interdependent amplification cycle that generates additional piRNAs, preserving the bias towards antisense. The antisense piRNAs probably direct cleavage of transposon mRNA or chromatin modification at transposon loci. SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine.

sizes of siRNAs: 21 and 24 nucleotides38,39. The 21-nucleotide siRNAs are produced by DCl4, but in the absence of DCl4, DCl2 can substitute, producing 22-nucleotide siRNAs40–44. The DCl4-produced 21-mers typically associate with AGo1 and guide mRNA cleavage. The 24-mers associate with AGo4 (in the major pathway) and AGo6 (in the surrogate pathway), and promote the formation of repressive chromatin45.

In plants, exogenous sources of siRNAs are not confined to dsRNAs. Single-stranded sense transcripts from tandemly repeated or highly expressed single-copy transgenes are converted to dsRNA by RDR6, a member of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) family that transcribe ssRNAs from an RNA template46 (BOX 1). RDR6 and RDR1 also convert viral ssRNA into dsRNA, initiating an antiviral RNAi response47. The

RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) amplify the silencing response. Primary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), Nature Reviews | which are derived from exogenous triggers by Dicer processing, bind their mRNA targets and direct cleavage by Genetics Argonaute (AGO) complexes204. In plants, RdRPs (including RDR6) use these cleaved transcript fragments as templates to synthesize long dsRNA; the dsRNA is then diced into secondary siRNAs41,42,44,46,205–207 (see figure). Secondary siRNAs are formed by DICER-LIKE 4 (DCL4) both 5′ and 3′ of the primary targeted interval, suggesting that mRNA cleavage, rather than priming of RdRP by primary siRNAs, is the signal for siRNA amplification. Other data suggest that production of secondary siRNAs in Arabidopsis might sometimes be primed208. RdRP amplification of siRNAs is especially important in defending plants against viral infection. In Caenorhabditis elegans, primary siRNAs are amplified into secondary siRNAs by a different mechanism204. In worms, primary siRNAs are bound to RDE-1, a ‘primary Argonaute’ (REFS 209,210). The primary siRNAs guide RDE-1 to the target mRNA, to which it recruits RdRPs that synthesize secondary siRNAs211,212 (see figure). Worm secondary siRNAs have a 5′ diphosphate or triphosphate, indicating that they are produced by transcription rather than by dicing209,210,213 and, at least in vitro, secondary siRNA production does not require Dicer212. How the length of siRNA transcription is controlled is perplexing but, in vitro, the Neurospora crassa RdRP, QDE1, can directly transcribe short RNA oligomers of ~22 nucleotides from a much longer template213. As a consequence of their production by an RdRP, secondary siRNAs in C. elegans are exclusively antisense to their mRNA targets209,214. Secondary siRNAs function when bound to secondary Argonautes (SAGOs), such as CSR-1, which can cleave its mRNA targets in the same way as fly and human AGO2 proteins212. The presence of siRNA amplification in plants, worms, fungi and, according to some early reports, flies, led to the speculation that RdRPs are a universal feature of RNAi. An amplification step in human RNAi could produce secondary siRNAs bearing homology to other genes — a significant impediment to the use of RNAi as a target discovery tool or as therapy for human diseases. However, the success of allele-specific RNAi in cultured human cells and in mice makes it unlikely that an RdRP-catalysed amplification step occurs in mammals215–219. Similarly, extensive biochemical and genetic studies have shown that the fly RNAi pathway does not use an RdRP enzyme5,39,220–223.

resulting dsRNA is cleaved by Dicer into siRNAs that are terminally 2′-O-methylated by HEN1 (REF. 36). It is poorly understood why plant RNAs that are expressed from transgenes are converted by RDR6 into dsRNA

Figure 2 | Plant endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) biogenesis. Cis-acting siRNAs (casiRNAs), Nature Reviews | Genetics trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) and natural antisense transcript-derived siRNAs (natsiRNAs) are derived from distinct loci. Several of the proteins involved in their biogenesis are genetically redundant, whereas others have specialized roles. a | casiRNAs are the most abundant endogenously produced siRNAs in plants. The RNA polymerases POL IV and RDR2 are proposed to generate dsRNA precursors, which are then diced by DICER-LIkE 3 (DCL3) to generate 24-nucleotide casiRNAs. The methyltransferase HEN1 adds the 2′-O-methyl modification at the 3′ end. These small RNAs load into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) and perhaps AGO6, and promote heterochromatin assembly by targeting DNA methylation and histone modification at the corresponding loci. b | tasiRNA biogenesis requires microRNA (miRNA)-mediated cleavage of transcripts from the TAS loci (pre-tasiRNA), which triggers the production of dsRNA by RDR6. The dsRNA is diced into 21-nucleotide tasiRNAs by DCL4 and acts through either AGO1 or AGO7. c | natsiRNAs are derived from overlapping regions of convergent transcripts and require DCL1 or DCL2, POL IV, RDR6 and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) for their biogenesis.

example, those lacking a 5′ cap or 3′ poly(A) tail — act as substrates for RdRPs. Highly expressed transgenes might overwhelm normal RNA quality-control pathways, escape destruction and be converted to dsRNA by RdRPs47–49.

endo-siRNAs The first endo-siRNAs were detected in plants and C. elegans38,50,51, and the recent discovery of endo-siRNAs in flies and mammals suggests that endo-siRNAs are ubiquitous among higher eukaryotes.
Plant endo-siRNAs. In plants, cis-acting siRNAs (casiRNAs) originate from transposons, repetitive elements and tandem repeats such as 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and comprise the bulk of endo-siRNAs44 (FIG. 2). casiRNAs are predominantly 24 nucleotides and are methylated by HEN1. Their accumulation requires DCl3 and the RNA polymerases RDR2 and Pol IV, and either AGo6 (primarily) or AGo4, which acts redundantly 44,51–60. casiRNAs promote heterochromatin formation by

directing DNA methylation and histone modification at the loci from which they originate38,44,51,52,61–63. Another class of plant endo-siRNAs illustrates how distinct small RNA pathways interact. Trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) are endo-siRNAs generated by the convergence of the miRNA and siRNA pathways in plants64–68 (FIG. 2). miRNA-directed cleavage of certain transcripts recruits the RdRP enzyme RDR6. RDR6 then copies the cleaved transcript into dsRNA, which DCl4 dices into tasiRNAs that are phased. This phasing suggests that DCl4 begins dicing precisely at the miRNA cleavage site, making a tasiRNA every 21 nucleotides68. The site of miRNA cleavage is crucial, because in determining the entry point for Dicer it establishes the target specificity of the tasiRNA produced. one of the determinants that seems to predispose a transcript to produce tasiRNAs after its cleavage by a miRNA is the presence of a second miRNA- or siRNA-complementary site on the transcript. of particular note is the TAS3 locus, the RNA transcript of which has two binding sites for miR-390. only one of these sites is efficiently cleaved

by miR-390, but binding of the miRNA to both sites seems to be required to initiate conversion of the TAS3 transcript to dsRNA by RDR6 (REFS 69,70). Natural antisense transcript-derived siRNAs (natsiRNAs) are produced in response to stress in plants71,72 (FIG. 2). They are generated from a pair of convergently transcribed RNAs: typically, one transcript is expressed constitutively, whereas the complementary RNA is transcribed only when the plant is subject to environmental stress, such as high salt levels. Production of 21- and 24-nucleotide siRNAs from region of overlap between the two transcripts requires DCl2 and/or DCl1, RDR6, SGS3 (SuPPRESSoR oF GENE SIlENCING 3, probably an RNA-binding protein)73 and Pol IV71,72. The natsiRNAs then direct cleavage of one of the mRNAs of the pair, and in one such case, trigger the DCl1dependent production of 21-nucleotide secondary siRNAs72. In addition to natsiRNAs, ‘long’ siRNAs (lsiRNAs) in Arabidopsis species also originate from natural antisense transcript pairs and are stress induced. unlike natsi-RNAs, lsiRNAs are 30–40 nucleotides and require DCl1, DCl4, AGo7, RDR6 and Pol IV for their production74. Animal endo-siRNAs. Plant and worm endo-siRNAs are typically produced through the action of RdRPs (BOX 1). The genomes of flies and mammals do not seem to encode such RdRP proteins, so the recent discovery of endo-siRNAs in flies and mice was unexpected.

The first mammalian endo-siRNAs to be reported corresponded to the long interspersed nuclear element (l1) retrotransposon and were detected in cultured human cells75. Full-length l1 contains both sense and antisense promoters in its 5′ uTR that could, in principle, drive bidirectional transcription of l1, producing overlapping complementary transcripts to be processed into siRNAs by Dicer. However, the precise mechanism by which transposons trigger siRNA production in mammals remains unknown. More recently, endo-siRNAs have been detected in somatic and germ cells of Drosophila species and in mouse oocytes. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from germline and somatic tissues of Drosophila and of AGo2 immunoprecipitates revealed a population of small RNAs that could readily be distinguished from miRNAs and piRNAs76–81. These small RNAs are nearly always exactly 21 nucleotides, are present in both sense and antisense orientations, have modified 3′ ends and, unlike miRNAs and piRNAs, are not biased towards beginning with uracil. Production of the 21-mers requires DCR-2, although in the absence of DCR-2 a remnant of the endo-siRNA population inexplicably persists. Fly endo-siRNAs derive from transposons, heterochromatic sequences, intergenic regions, long RNA transcripts with extensive structure and, most interestingly, from mRNAs (FIG. 3). Expression of transposon mRNAs increases in both dcr‑2 and ago‑2 mutants,

implicating an endogenous RNAi pathway in the silencing of transposons in flies, as reported previously for C. elegans 82,83. siRNAs derived from mRNAs are over ten times more likely to come from regions that are predicted to produce overlapping convergent transcripts than expected by chance76, suggesting that endo-siRNAs originate from the endogenous dsRNA that is formed when these complementary transcripts pair. A subset of fly endo-siRNAs derives from ‘structured loci’, RNA transcripts of which can fold into long intramolecularly paired hairpins77–79. Accumulation of these siRNAs requires DCR-2 and the dsRNA-binding protein loquacious (loQS) — which is typically considered the partner of DCR-1, the Dicer that produces miRNA — rather than R2D2 (REF. 84), the usual partner of DCR-2 (FIG. 1). Although surprising, a role for loQS in the biogenesis of endo-siRNAs from structured loci was anticipated by the earlier finding that loQS has a role in the production of siRNAs from transgenes that are designed to produce long intramolecularly paired inverted-repeat transcripts that trigger RNAi in flies85. endo-siRNAs have also been identified in mouse oocytes 86,87. As in flies, mouse endo-siRNAs are 21 nucleotides, Dicer-dependent and derived from a variety of genomic sources (FIG. 3). The mouse endosiRNAs were bound to AGo2, the only mammalian Argonaute protein thought to mediate target cleavage, although it is not known if they also associate with any of the other three mouse Argonaute proteins. Mammalian AGo2 is not, however, the orthologue of fly AGo2, the sequence of which is considerably diverged from other Argonaute proteins. A subset of mouse oocyte endo-siRNAs maps to regions of protein-coding genes that are capable of pairing to their cognate pseudogenes, and to regions of pseudogenes that are capable of forming invertedrepeat structures (FIG. 3). Pseudogenes can no longer encode proteins, but they drift from their ancestral sequence more slowly than would be expected if they were simply junk DNA. Perhaps some pseudogene sequences are under evolutionary selection to retain the ability to produce antisense transcripts that can pair with their cognate genes to produce endo-siRNAs88. A key challenge for the future will be to understand the biological function of endo-siRNAs, especially those that can pair with protein-coding mRNAs. Do they regulate mRNA expression? And can endo-siRNAs act like miRNAs, tuning the expression of large numbers of genes? regulation. In 2001, tens of miRNAs were identified in humans, flies and worms by small RNA cloning and sequencing, thereby establishing miRNAs as a new class of small silencing RNAs93–95. miRBase (release 12.0), the registry that coordinates miRNA naming, now lists 1,638 distinct miRNA genes in plants and 6,930 in animals and their viruses96. miRNA biogenesis. miRNAs derive from precursor transcripts called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) 97–100. Several miRNA genes are present as clusters in the genome and probably derive from a common pri-miRNA transcript. liberating a 20–24-nucleotide miRNA from its pri-miRNA requires the sequential action of two RNase III endonucleases, assisted by their dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) partner proteins (FIG. 1). First, the pri-miRNA is processed in the nucleus into a 60–70-nucleotide pre-miRNA by Drosha, acting with its dsRBD partner — DGCR8 in mammals and Pasha in flies97,101–105. The resulting pre-miRNA has a hairpin structure: a loop flanked by base-paired arms that form a stem. Pre-miRNAs have a two-nucleotide overhang at their 3′ ends and a 5′ phosphate group, which are indicative of their production by an RNase III. The nuclear export protein Exportin 5 carries the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm bound to Ran, a GTPase that moves RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore106–109. In the cytoplasm, Dicer and its dsRBD partner protein, TRBP in mammals and loQS in flies, cleaves the pre-miRNA7,11–13,85,110–113. Dicer — like Argonaute proteins but unlike Drosha — contains a PAZ domain, presumably allowing it to bind the two-nucleotide 3′-overhanging end left by Drosha. Dicer cleavage generates a duplex containing two strands, termed miRNA and miRNA*, corresponding to the two sides of the base of the stem. These correspond to the guide and passenger strands of an siRNA, and similar thermodynamic criteria influence the choice of miRNA versus miRNA*22,23. miRNAs can arise from either arm of the pre-miRNA stem, and some pre-miRNAs produce mature miRNAs from both arms, whereas others show such pronounced asymmetry that the miRNA* is rarely detected even in high-throughput sequencing experiments (BOX 2). In flies, worms and mammals, a few pre-miRNAs are produced by the nuclear pre-mRNA splicing pathway instead of through processing by Drosha115–119. These pre-miRNA-like introns, termed mirtrons, are spliced out of mRNA precursors. The spliced introns first accumulate as lariat products that require 2′–5′ debranching by a lariat-debranching enzyme. Debranching yields an authentic pre-miRNA, which can then enter the standard miRNA biogenesis pathway. In plants, DCl1 fills the roles of both Drosha and Dicer, converting pri-miRNAs to miRNA–miRNA* duplexes44,120–122. DCl1, assisted by its dsRBD partner Hyl1, converts pri-miRNAs to miRNA–miRNA* duplexes in the nucleus, after which the miRNA– miRNA* duplex is thought to be exported to the

The lin‑4 locus produces a 22-nucleotide RNA that is partially complementary to sequences in the 3′ uTR of its regulatory target, the lin‑14 mRNA90–92. miRNA binding to partially complementary sites in mRNA 3′ uTRs is now considered to be a hallmark of animal miRNA

Box 2 | High-throughput sequencing and small RNA discovery
Much of the credit for the identification of small RNAs rests with advances in high-throughput sequencing. Currently, there are three commercial ‘high depth’ sequencing systems: the Roche 454 GS FLX Genome Analyzer, the Illumina Solexa Genome Analyzer and, most recently, the Applied Biosystem SOLiD System. REF. 224 describes how each method works. Whereas 454 has the advantage of sequencing >250 bp per read, compared with ~35–50 bp for Solexa and SOLiD, the Solexa and SOLiD platforms provide 70-fold to 400-fold greater sequencing depth. All three platforms have been used successfully to identify novel small RNA species and to discover new small RNA classes in plants and animals. Using less than 10 μg of total RNA, high-throughput sequencing, together with advances in small RNA library preparation, has revealed the length distribution, sequence identity, terminal structure, sequence and strand biases, isoform prevalence, genomic origins, and mode of biogenesis for millions of small RNAs. Initial small RNA sequencing experiments sought simply to identify novel small RNA species and classes. Increasingly, high-throughput sequencing is being used to profile small RNA expression across the stages of development and in different tissues and disease states. Profiling by deep sequencing provides quantitative information about small RNA expression, as would PCR or microarray-based approaches, but can also precisely detect subtle changes in small RNA sequence or length. Perhaps the most problematic step in small RNA sequencing is preparing the small RNA library. The most frequently used cloning protocols require the small RNAs to have a 5′ phosphate and a 3′ hydroxyl group — the hallmarks of Dicer products. This approach identifies small RNAs with the expected termini, but alternative methods must be used to find small RNAs, such as Caenorhabditis elegans secondary siRNAs, with other terminal structures. Additionally, finding every possible small RNA in a cell using exhaustive deep sequencing is an approach with diminishing returns. For example, although many microRNAs have been sequenced hundreds of thousands or even a million times, the C. elegans miRNA lsy‑6, which is apparently expressed in less than ten cells of the adult, has so far eluded high-depth sequencing225.

specificity determinant for target selection. The small size of the seed means that a single miRNA can regulate many, even hundreds, of different genes 143,144. Intriguingly, recent data suggest that the nuclear transcriptional history of an mRNA influences whether a miRNA represses its translation at the initiation or the elongation step145. As plant miRNAs are highly complementary to their mRNA targets, they can direct mRNA target cleavage. Nonetheless, AGo1-loaded plant miRNAs can also block translation, suggesting a common mechanism between plant and animal miRNAs, despite the absence of specific miRNAs shared between the two kingdoms146. Functions of miRNAs. like transcription factors, miRNAs regulate diverse cellular pathways and are widely believed to regulate most biological processes in plants and animals, ranging from housekeeping functions to responses to environmental stress. Covering this vast body of work is beyond the scope of this article; the cited reviews provide valuable insight 147–149. The study of miRNA pathway mutants provided early evidence for the influence of miRNAs on biological processes in both plants and animals. loss of Dicer or miRNA-associated Argonaute proteins is nearly always lethal in animals, and such mutants show severe developmental defects in both plants and animals. In Drosophila species, dcr‑1 mutant germline stem-cell clones divide slowly; in Arabidopsis species, embryogenesis is abnormal in dcl1 mutants; in C. elegans, dcr‑1 mutants display defects in germline development and embryonic morphogenesis; zebrafish lacking both maternal and zygotic Dicer are similarly defective in embryogenesis; and mice lacking Dicer die as early embryos, apparently devoid of stem cells14,120,150–153. loss of Dicer in mouse embryonic fibroblasts causes increased DNA damage and, consequently, the upregulation of signalling by the tumour suppressor proteins p19ARF and p53, which induces premature senescence154. Many miRNAs function in specific biological processes, in specific tissues and at specific times155. The importance of small silencing RNAs goes far beyond the RNA silencing field: long-standing questions about the molecular basis of pluripotency, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, cell identity and so on are finding answers in small RNAs147,156.

cytoplasm by HASTy, an Exportin 5 homologue (hasty mutants develop precociously, hence their name) 65,122–124. unlike animal miRNAs, plant miRNAs are 2′-O-methylated at their 3′ ends by HEN1 (REFS 34,120,125). HEN1 protects plant miRNAs from 3′ uridylation, which is thought to be a signal for degradation36. HEN1 probably acts before miRNAs are loaded into AGo1, because both miRNA* and miRNA strands are modified in plants34. Target regulation by miRNAs. The mechanism by which a miRNA regulates its mRNA target reflects both the specific Argonaute protein into which the small RNA is loaded and the extent of complementarity between the miRNA and the mRNA126–128. A few miRNAs in flies and mammals are nearly fully complementary to their mRNA targets; these direct endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA129–133. Such extensive complementarity is considered the norm in plants, as target cleavage was thought to be the main mode of target regulation in plants39,62,134. However, in flies and mammals, most miRNAs pair with their targets through only a limited region of sequence at the 5′ end of the miRNA called the ‘seed region’; these miRNAs repress translation and direct degradation of their mRNA targets 135–140. The seed region of all small silencing RNAs contributes most of the energy for target binding 141,142. Thus, the seed is the primary

piRNAs: the longest small RNAs piRNAs function in the germ line. piRNAs are the most recently discovered class of small RNAs and, as their name suggests, they bind to the Piwi clade of Argonaute proteins. (Animal Argonaute proteins can be subdivided by sequence relatedness into Argonaute and Piwi subfamilies.) The Piwi clade comprises Piwi, Aubergine (AuB) and AGo3 in flies, MIlI, MIwI and MIwI2 in mice (also called PIwIl1, PIwIl2 and PIwIl4, respectively), and HIlI, HIwI1, HIwI2 and HIwI3 in humans (also called PIwIl2, PwIl, PIwIl4 and PIwIl3, respectively).

piRNAs were first proposed to ensure germline stability by repressing transposons when Aravin and colleagues discovered in flies a class of longer small RNAs (~25–30 nucleotides) associated with silencing of repetitive elements157. later, these ‘repeat associated small interfering RNAs’ — subsequently renamed piRNAs — were found to be distinct from siRNAs: they bind Piwi proteins and do not require DCR-1 or DCR-2 for their production, unlike miRNAs and siRNAs33,158,159. Moreover, they are 2′-O-methylated at their 3′ termini, unlike miRNAs but similar to siRNAs in flies32,158,160–162. High-throughput sequencing of vertebrate piRNAs revealed a class of piRNAs unrelated to repetitive sequences87,163–169. Mammalian piRNAs can be divided into pre-pachytene and pachytene piRNAs, according to the stage of meiosis at which they are expressed in developing spermatocytes. like piRNAs in flies, pre-pachytene piRNAs predominantly correspond to repetitive sequences and are implicated in silencing transposons, such as l1 and intracisternal A-particle (IAP)166. In male mice, gametic methylation patterns are established when germ cells arrest their cell cycle 14.5 days post-coitum, resuming cell division 2–3 days after birth170,171. Both MIlI and MIwI2 are expressed during this period, and Miwi2- and Mili-deficient mice lose DNA methylation marks on transposons172. The pre-pachytene piRNAs, which bind MIwI2 and MIlI, might serve as guides to direct DNA methylation of transposons. In contrast to pre-pachytene piRNAs, the pachytene piRNAs mainly arise from unannotated regions of the genome, not transposons, and their function remains unknown166. Three recent studies report that the previously discovered germline ‘21u’ RNAs in C. elegans are piRNAs114,173–175. These small RNAs were initially identified by high-throughput sequencing 114. They are precisely 21 nucleotides, begin with a uridine 5′-monophosphate and are 3′ modified. They bind Piwi-related gene (PRG-1), a C. elegans Piwi protein. Each 21uRNA might be transcribed separately, as they all are flanked by a common upstream motif. like piRNAs in Drosophila species, the 21u-RNAs are required for maintenance of the germ line and fertility, and like Drosophila AuB and other piRNA pathway components, PRG-1 is found in specialized ‘P granules’, which are associated with germline function, in a perinuclear ring called nuage. worm piRNAs resemble pachytene piRNAs in mammals: their targets and functions are largely unknown.

production of distal piRNAs up to 168 kb away. Thus, an enormously long, ssRNA transcript seems to be the source of the piRNAs that derive from the flamenco locus177. The current model for piRNA biogenesis was inferred from the sequences of piRNAs that are bound to Piwi, AuB and AGo3 (REFS 177,184). piRNAs bound to Piwi and AuB are typically antisense to transposon mRNAs, whereas AGo3 is loaded with piRNAs corresponding to the transposon mRNAs themselves (FIG. 1). Moreover, the first 10 nucleotides of antisense piRNAs are frequently complementar y to the sense piRNAs found in AGo3. This unexpected sequence complementarity has been proposed to reflect a feed-forward amplification mechanism — ‘piRNA ping-pong’— that is activated only after transcription of transposon mRNA177,184 (FIG. 4). A similar amplification loop has been inferred from high-throughput piRNA sequencing in vertebrates, implying that it has been conserved through evolution163,172. Many aspects of the ping-pong model remain speculative. why AGo3 seems to bind only sense piRNAs derived from transposon mRNAs is unknown. An untested idea is that different forms of RNA Pol II transcribe primary piRNA transcripts and transposon mRNAs, and that the specialized RNA Pol II that transcribes the primary piRNA precursor recruits Piwi and AuB, but not AGo3. How the 3′ ends of piRNAs are made is also not known. piRNA function and regulation. Piwi family proteins are indispensable for germline development in many, perhaps all, animals; but they have thus far been most extensively studied in Drosophila species. Piwi is restricted to the nucleoplasm of Drosophila germ cells and adjacent somatic cells. Piwi is required to maintain germline stem cells and to promote their division; the protein is required in both the somatic niche cells that support germline stem cells and in the stem cells themselves185,186. In the male germ line, AuB is required for the silencing of the repetitive Stellate locus, which would otherwise cause male sterility. Expression of Stellate is controlled by the related repetitive Suppressor of Stellate locus, the source of antisense piRNAs that act through AuB to repress Stellate157,158,187. aubergine was originally identified because it is required for specification of the embryonic axes188. The loss of anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral patterning in embryos from mothers lacking AuB is an indirect consequence of the dsDNA breaks that occur in the oocyte in its absence189. The breaks seem to activate a DNA-damage checkpoint that disrupts patterning of the oocyte and, consequently, of the embryo. The defects in patterning, but not in silencing repetitive elements, are rescued by mutations that bypass the DNA damage signalling pathway, suggesting the breaks are caused by transposition. That activation of a DNA damage checkpoint should inappropriately reorganize embryonic polarity was unexpected, but further underscores the vital part piRNAs play in germline development.

Biogenesis of piRNAs. piRNA sequences are stunningly diverse, with more than 1.5 million distinct piRNAs identified thus far in flies, but collectively they map to a few hundred genomic clusters77,79,81,159,176–178. The best studied cluster is the flamenco locus. flamenco was identified genetically as a repressor of the gypsy, ZAM and Idefix transposons33,179–183. unlike siRNAs, flamenco piRNAs are mainly antisense, suggesting that piRNAs arise from long, single-stranded precursor RNAs. In fact, disruption of flamenco by insertion of a P-element near the 5′ end of the locus blocks the

Figure 4 | Feed-forward or ‘ping-pong’ model for Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) amplification. According to this model, antisense piRNAs in Piwi or Aubergine (AUB) first bind transposon mRNAs and cleave them across from Nature Reviews | Genetics position 10 of the antisense piRNA guide. The 5′ end of the cleaved product is thought to then load into AGO3 and generate an AGO3-bound sense piRNA. The sense piRNA can, in turn, guide cleavage of an antisense piRNA precursor transcript, fuelling the feed-forward amplification loop. A key postulate of the model is that the intracellular concentrations of piRNA-loaded Piwi and AUB are much greater than of piRNA-loaded AGO3. The amplification loop is proposed to facilitate piRNA surveillance of transposon transcription in the germ line. The methyltransferase HEN1 adds the 2′-O-methyl modification at the 3′ end.

piRNAs outside the germ line? The role of piRNAs in the fly soma is hotly debated. Piwi and AuB are required to silence tandem arrays of white, a gene required to produce red eye pigment 190. It is not understood if piRNAs are produced in the soma as well as in the germ line, or if piRNAs that are present during germline development deposit long-lived chromatin marks that exert their effects days later. Both piRNAs and endo-siRNAs repress transposons in the germ line, where mutations caused by transposition would propagate to the next generation. siRNAs, which are produced by the RNAi pathway, probably provide a rapid response to the introduction of a new transposon into the germ line, a challenge not dissimilar to a viral infection. By contrast, the piRNA system seems to provide a more robust, permanent solution to the acquisition of a transposon. In the

soma, however, endo-siRNAs are the predominant transposon-derived small RNA class, and their loss in dcr‑2 and ago2 mutants increases transposon expression76,77,79,81. Somatic piRNA-like small RNAs have been observed in ago2 mutant flies76. Perhaps, in the absence of endo-siRNAs, piRNAs are produced somatically and resume transposon surveillance. Such a model implies significant cross-talk between the piRNA and endo-siRNA–generating machineries.

Intertwined pathways The RNAi, miRNA and piRNA pathways were initially believed to be independent and distinct. However, the lines distinguishing them continue to fade. These pathways interact and rely on each other at several levels, competing for and sharing substrates, effector proteins and cross-regulating each other.

Competition for substrates during loading. Both the siRNA and miRNA pathways load dsRNA duplexes containing an ~19 bp double-stranded core flanked by 3′ overhangs of two nucleotides. An siRNA duplex contains guide and passenger strands and is complementary throughout its core; a miRNA–miRNA* duplex contains mismatches, bulges and Gu wobble pairs. In Drosophila species, biogenesis of small RNA duplexes is uncoupled from its loading into AGo1 or AGo2 (REFS 191,192). Instead, loading is governed by the structure of the duplex: duplexes bearing bulges and mismatches are sorted into the miRNA pathway and hence loaded into AGo1; duplexes with greater double-stranded character partition into AGo2, the Argonaute protein that is associated with RNAi. The partitioning of small RNAs between AGo1 and AGo2 also has implications for target regulation. AGo1 primarily represses translation, whereas AGo2 represses by target cleavage, reflecting the faster rate of target cleavage by AGo2 compared with AGo1 (REF. 192). Sorting creates competition between the two pathways for substrates191,192. In Drosophila, loading of a small RNA duplex into one pathway decreases its association with the other pathway. Different dsRNA precursors require distinct combinations of proteins to produce small silencing RNAs. For example, Drosophila endo-siRNAs derived from structured loci require loQS rather than R2D2 (REFS 77–79). we presume that under some circumstances the endosiRNA and miRNA pathways might therefore compete for loQS. The endo-siRNA and RNAi pathways probably also compete for shared components. In contrast to Drosophila, plants load small RNAs into Argonautes according to the identity of the 5′ nucleotide of the small RNA69,193. AGo1 is the main effector Argonaute for miRNAs, and the majority of miRNAs begin with uridine; AGo4 is the major effector of the heterochromatic pathway and is predominantly loaded with small RNAs beginning with an adenosine194. AGo2 and AGo5, however, have no characterized function in plants194. Changing the 5′ nucleotide from adenosine to uracil shifts the loading bias of plant small RNAs from AGo2 to AGo1, and vice versa. Similarly, Arabidopsis AGo4 binds small RNAs that begin with adenosine, whereas AGo5 prefers cytidine. piRNAs bound to AuB and Piwi typically begin with uracil, whereas those bound to AGo3 show no 5′ nucleotide bias. It remains to be determined if this reflects a 5′-nucleotide preference like the situation for the plant Argonautes or some feature of an as yet undiscovered piRNA-loading machinery that sorts piRNAs between Piwi proteins. Cross talk. Small RNA pathways are often entangled. tasiRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis is a classic example of such cross talk between pathways. miRNAdirected cleavage of tasiRNA-generating transcripts initiates tasiRNA production and subsequent regulation of tasiRNA targets64–68. In C. elegans at least one piRNA has been implicated in initiating endo-siRNA production173,174, and in flies the endo-siRNA pathway might

repress expression of piRNAs in the soma76. Moreover, small RNA levels might be buffered by negative feedback loops in which small RNAs from one pathway alter the expression levels of RNA silencing proteins that act in the same or in other RNA silencing pathways195–199.

Conclusions Despite our growing understanding of the mechanism and function of small RNAs, their evolutionary origins remain obscure. siRNAs are present in all three eukaryotic kingdoms — plants, animals and fungi — and provide antiviral defence in at least plants and animals. Thus, the siRNA machinery was present in the last common ancestor of plants, animals and fungi. By contrast, miRNAs have only been found in land plants, in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in metazoan animals, but not in unicellular choanoflagellates or fungi200–202. Deep-sequencing experiments have found no miRNAs shared by plants and animals, suggesting that miRNA genes, unlike the miRNA protein machinery, arose independently at least twice in evolution. Finally, piRNAs seem to be the youngest major small RNA family, having been found only in metazoan animals202. Although Dicer proteins have been identified only in eukaryotes, Argonaute proteins can also be found in eubacteria and archaea, raising the prospect that small nucleic acids might have served as guides for proteins at the dawn of cellular life, and even though the machinery might be ancient, the small RNA guides have diversified over time to acquire specialized roles. The history of small silencing RNAs makes predicting the future particularly daunting, as new discoveries have come at a breakneck pace, with each new small RNA mechanism or function forcing a re-evaluation of cherished models and ‘facts’. Several longstanding but unanswered questions, however, are worth highlighting. First, does RNAi — in the sense of an siRNA-guided defence against external nucleic acid threats, such as viruses — exist in mammals? Second, how do miRNAs repress gene expression? Do several parallel mechanisms coexist in vivo, or will the current, apparently contradictory models for miRNA-directed translational repression and mRNA decay ultimately be unified in a larger mechanistic scheme? Third, can miRNAregulated genes ever be identified by computation alone, or will computational predictions ultimately give way to high-throughput experimental methods for associating individual miRNA species with their regulatory targets? will network analysis uncover themes in the relationships between miRNAs and their targets that reveal why miRNA regulation is so widespread in animals? Fourth, how are piRNAs made? The feed-forward amplification ‘ping-pong’ model is appealing, but probably underestimates the complexity of piRNA biogenesis mechanisms. we do not yet know how piRNA 3′ ends are generated. Nor do we have a coherent model for how long, antisense transcripts from piRNA clusters are fragmented into piRNAs. Finally, will the increasing number of examples of small RNAs carrying epigenetic information across generations3,203 ultimately force us to re-examine our Mendelian view of inheritance?
