Data Processing and Analysis. Mass spectral data was processed using CompPASS, as previously described1 with modifications discussed below. Briefly, Sequest summary files were processed into a high threshold dataset based on a 2% protein false-positive rate by keeping the XCorr thresholds for each charge state constant while varying the ΔCn (thresholds: XCorr 2+ ≥ 2.5; XCorr 3+ ≥ 3.2; XCorr 4+ ≥ 3.5; +1 charge states were not collected). These processed data sets were merged for each duplicate run and used to populate a “stats table” consisting of each dataset for the AIN as well as 102 unrelated proteins (Dubs and their selected HCIPs1; N https://harper.hms.harvard.edu/CompPASS_Dubs.html). The D -score and Z-score are calculated from total spectral counts (TSCs) for each protein found in association with each bait. Because CompPASS was originally designed for analysis of mostly non-reciprocal datasets, we devised a new weighted DN-score (WDN-score) (Supplementary Fig. S2), which aids in the identification of HCIPs that are associated with multiple baits in a network. WDN-scores were calculated as:

where ωj is the weight factor for interactor j (Eq. 3), σj is the standard deviation of the TSCs for interactor j and the raw WD-score is divided by the threshold WD-score determined in the same manner as for the D-score described previously 1. The previously described D-score is Eq. 1 without ωj. The analyzed files, the primary output from CompPASS, were used for all analysis described here. As described below, we found significant interconnectivity in the network. Proteins identified in each LC-MS/MS experiment with a WDN-scores ≥ 1 and a p-value ≤ 4.9 x10-6 are considered HCIPs. Comparison of HCIP abundance. In order to compare the abundance of HCIPs found in the wild type and mutant ATG8 protein IP-MS/MS experiments we used the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) approach previously applied to determine the abundance of proteins found in IP-

MS/MS datasets2. For each interactor in each IP-MS/MS experiments, the NSAF was calculated and then difference in NSAF values for that protein in wild type control and mutant experiment was determined. In order to plot the data using the log2 values of this difference while maintaining the proper sign of the value (positive for increase and negative for decrease), the conventional NSAF was multiplied by 100,000 so that each value was ≥ 1 before taking the log2 of the difference. Gene Ontology Analysis of the AIN and ATG8 networks. Gene Ontology (GO) process analysis was performed on both the HCIPs (WDN-score > 1.0) from the AIN and separately for the HCIPs from the ATG8 sub network using inhouse software. GO process terms were manually grouped into 25 broad categories for simplicity (Supplemental Table S7). HCIPs from each IP-MS/MS experiment were assigned a broad GO category where a single HCIP could have multiple category assignments, but only 1 per category. A final table of broad GO terms (Using the March 6, 2010 release) and their percentage found across all HCIPs was generated. This was repeated for non-HCIP proteins as well and was used to generate a mean and standard deviation for each broad GO category, representing the values found for each in the background protein dataset. GO term values for HCIPs were compared to these background values and p-values were calculated (Supplemental Fig. S5a). We feel that this method better reflects the enrichment of GO terms in our data rather than using the distributions for GO terms found across the entire human proteome because our IPMS/MS procedure does not truly randomly sample all proteins in the proteome. Indeed, inspection of GO enrichment for background proteins shows that GO terms relating to canonical background proteins (such as “folding”, “translation”, and “cytoskeleton”) are significantly enriched in our background data when compared to the expected values for the human proteome (Supplemental Fig. S5a).

PIK3C3 Development of a module within CompPASS to collapse networks ATG3 UVRAG using available protein interaction databases and its application to the autophagy KBTBD6 TMEM160 ATG16L1 TECPR1 interaction network (AIN). a, Since the nature of the interactions identified in our IPKBTBD7 RABGAP1 MS/MS data cannot be determined to be ATG10 either MAP1LC3C NEK9 indirect, we chose to analyze direct or NSMAF these interactions at a more conservative level by collapsing known multimeric protein complexes (present in BIOGRID, MINT and STRING) into a single representative node. For example, ifPrimary baitbait hub the 6 hub proteins known to form a complex are found as HCIPs for a given Secondary bait, it cannot be hub HCIP determined to which of these 6 the bait directly interacts. Therefore, HCIP hub 6 rather than reportingedgeinteractions for this bait, we report a single interaction to a known Subthreshold HCIP hub protein complex comprised edge those 6 interacting proteins. In this manner, we feel that of Primary bait we are not over-representing the number of interactions and can also better report HCIP HCIP associations withedge known protein complexes. b, Summary of novel and known interactions found using the Network Collapse function in CompPASS (panel a).

Functional and structural analysis of the autophagy interaction network. a, Enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) process descriptors for HCIPs (WDNscore ≥1.0, p < 10-5) in the autophagy interaction network (AIN, left panel), the ATG8 sub-network (center panel), and proteins with WDN-scores13 ≥ 1.0 (right panel). Enrichments were determined as described in the Supplemental Methods section. b, Hierarchical clustering of proteins found associated with 65 bait proteins, with the number of PFAM domains present indicated by the heat map. c, Distribution of PFAM domains found among baits (red bars) and HCIPs (blue bars). d, Analysis of hubs in the AIN. Hubs were identified based on their presence as HCIPs in IP-MS/MS experiments from 3 different baits with WDN-Score ≥3 each and an average WDN-Score ≥2 acrcoss all IP-MS/MS experiments in which a hub candidate was present based on TSCs. Primary and secondary bait refers to the classification in Fig 1. Figure S6.

Figure S4. Development of a module within CompPASS to collapse networks using available protein interaction databases and its application to the autophagy interaction network 115 (AIN). a, Since the nature of the interactions identified115in our IP115 MS/MS data cannot be determined to be either direct or indirect, we chose to analyze 64 64 64 these interactions at a more conservative level by collapsing known multimeric protein complexes (present in26BIOGRID, MINT and STRING) into a single representative node. 26 26 For example, if the 6 proteins known to form a complex are found as HCIPs for a given bait, it cannot be determined to which of these 6 the bait directly interacts. 115 Therefore, 115 115 rather than reporting 6 interactions for this bait, we report a single interaction to a known 64 64 64 protein complex comprised of those 6 interacting proteins. In this manner, we feel that we are not over-representing the number of interactions and can also better report 26 26 26 associations with known protein complexes. b, Summary of novel and known interactions found using the Network Collapse function in CompPASS (panel a).

Figure S13. RNAi analysis of genes in the autophagy interaction network. a, Representative images of GFP-MAPLC3B expressing U2OS cells after transfection with the indicated siRNAs in the presence and absence of Rapamycin (200 nM, 6h). DRAQ5 is used to mark nuclei. The GFP images are the same as those used in Fig. 5a in the main paper. b, Normalized integrated spot signal per cell (N-ISSC) for U2OS cells expressing GFP-MAP1LC3B either alone or 6 h after treatment with rapamycin or Torin1 (200 nM). c, α-LC3 blot of U2OS cells with the indicated treatments. d, Representative images of GFP-GABARAP expressing U2OS cells after transfection with the indicated siRNAs in the presence. DRAQ5 is used to mark nuclei. e, ISSC values for cells transfected with 296 siRNAs targeting 74 genes. f, Normalized ISSC (N-ISSC) for GFPGABARAP with or without Rapamycin (6 h) (4 siRNAs/gene). Unless noted otherwise, p < 0.01 using Students T-test; *, p<0.05; white rectangles, p>0.05. g, Quantitative RT30 PCR results for depletion of the indicated genes in U2OS cells. Error bars, Standard Deviation, n = 3. h, Validation of siRNA mediated depletion of CDC37, PDCD6IP, PI4K2A, ATG12, ATG5, and NEDD4. Four siRNAs targeting the indicated genes were transfected into U2OS cells and after 72 h, cells were lysed and probed with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Blots were re-probed with PCNA as a loading control. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies, with the exception of anti-PI4K2A, which was from Novus. i, Validation of flow cytometry flux assay. Color-coding for histogram and bar-graph correspond. GFP-MAP1LC3B U2OS cells or empty U2OS cells were subjected to flow cytomety. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined using FLOWJO. Torin1 activated flux through the autophagy pathway and this was reversed by BafA1 treatment. Error bars, Standard Deviation, n = 2.
