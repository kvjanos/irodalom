MECHANISMS OF DISEASE

Molecular mechanisms of muscular dystrophies: old and new players
Kay E Davies* and Kristen J Nowak‡

Abstract | The study of the muscle cell in the muscular dystrophies (MDs) has shown that mutant proteins result in perturbations of many cellular components. MDs have been associated with mutations in structural proteins, signalling molecules and enzymes as well as mutations that result in aberrant processing of mRNA or alterations in post-translational modifications of proteins. These findings have not only revealed important insights for cell biologists, but have also provided unexpected and exciting new approaches for therapy.

The term muscular dystrophy (MD) encompasses over 30 different inherited diseases, all involving progressive weakness and degeneration of skeletal muscle (BOX 1). MDs can be devastating diseases with weakened skeletal muscles leading to loss of ambulation, difficulties in breathing and eating and, in most cases, premature death. Key features of dystrophic muscle include central nuclei, small regenerating fibres and accumulation of connective tissue and fatty tissue (see FIG. 1 for cross-sections of normal and dystrophic muscle). MDs do not usually involve the central nervous system or peripheral nerves (although some do), despite the close anatomical relationship between skeletal muscle and nerves, but they can affect the heart and other organs. Traditionally the MDs have been grouped according to their clinical and pathological manifestations (see Supplementary information S1 (box) for the more common types of MD). Genetically, MDs can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner or, in many cases, caused by de novo mutations, which are therefore sporadic. As the genetic causes have become apparent, MDs have been named to reflect the defective gene, for example, ‘laminopathies’, ‘titinopathies’, ‘dystrophinopathies’ and ‘dysferlinopathies’, with the same defective gene possibly causing more than one disease phenotype; these genedescribing titles sometimes group clinically distinct diseases together. For example, mutations in the gene that encodes the giant sarcomeric protein titin can cause both tibial MD (TMD) and the more severe limb girdle MD (LGMD2J), depending on whether the patient is heterozygous for the mutation (TMD) or homozygous for the mutation (LGMD2J)1. Moreover, some mutated genes not only cause more than one clinically distinct MD, but can also cause diseases that do not primarily affect skeletal muscle. Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear

proteins lamin A and lamin C can cause MDs2,3 as well as other diseases such as the premature ageing disease Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome4–9. To further complicate the situation, more than one gene can produce the same MD phenotype; for example, Emery–Dreifuss MD (EDMD) can be caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the LMNA gene3 or X-linked mutations in the gene encoding another nuclear protein, emerin10. Dystrophin was the first mutant protein shown to cause MD. Mutations of the dystrophin gene, the largest gene in the human genome, cause the most common MD, Duchenne MD (DMD), as well as the milder phenotype of Becker MD (BMD)11. Differing mutations within the dystrophin gene determine whether a patient shows a DMD or BMD phenotype. DMD results from an absence of dystrophin or expression of a non-functional protein, whereas BMD has been associated with reduction of wild-type dystrophin or expression of a partially functional protein. Although DMD was first described in the 1830s, it was not until 1975 that electron microscopy and biochemical analyses indicated that patients with DMD had a defect in the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) of muscle fibres12. The gene was located to Xp21 using linkage analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms13. The causative gene was identified in 1987 and encodes the dystrophin protein11 (so-called because its deficiency causes dystrophy), which is localized at the sarcoplasmic surface of the sarcolemma. This was one of the first genes to be identified by positional cloning and its discovery led to the identification of other genes involved in MDs. In this review, we discuss the vast array of skeletalmuscle proteins that are currently associated with MD (FIGS 2,3). Historically, defects in structural proteins have been predominantly associated with MD. However, we

The fundamental unit of muscle contraction, which extends from one Z-line to another.

Skeletal muscle is the muscle attached to the skeleton. Hundreds or thousands of muscle fibres bundle together to make up an individual skeletal muscle. Muscle fibres (myofibres) are long, cylindrical structures that are bound by a plasma membrane (the sarcolemma) and an overlying basal lamina and when grouped into bundles (fascicles) they make up muscle. The sarcolemma forms a physical barrier against the external environment and also mediates signals between the exterior and the muscle cell. The sarcoplasm is the specialized cytoplasm of the striated-muscle fibre that contains the usual subcellular elements along with the Golgi apparatus, abundant myofibrils, a modified endoplasmic reticulum known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), glycogen granules, myoglobin and mitochondria. Transverse (T)-tubules invaginate the sarcolemma (see the figure), which allows action-potential signals to penetrate the cell and activate the SR. As shown in the figure, the SR forms a network around the myofibrils, storing and providing the Ca2+ that is required for muscle contraction. Myofibrils are contractile units that consist of an ordered arrangement of longitudinal myofilaments. Myofilaments can be either thick filaments (comprised of myosin) or thin filaments (comprised of actin). Together they produce movement by contraction through the sliding filament model. The characteristic ‘striations’ of skeletal and cardiac muscle are readily observable by light microscopy as alternating light and dark bands on longitudinal sections (see the figure). The light band, (known as the I-band) is made up of thin filaments and is isotropic in polarized light, whereas the dark band (known as the A-band) is made up of thick filaments and is anisotropic. The M-line (for ‘mittelscheibe’ or middle disc) bisects the A-band and the Z-line (‘zwischenscheibe,’ or between disc; also known as the Z-disk or Z-band) defines the lateral boundary of each sarcomeric unit. Contraction of the sarcomere occurs when the Z-lines move closer together, making the myofibrils contract, and therefore the whole muscle cell and then the entire muscle contracts. Protein assemblies known as costameres, which are located on the peripheral myofibrils of the myofibre, line up with the Z-disk. Costameres physically link the sarcomeres, which produce force through contraction, with the sarcolemma and, are proposed to transmit this force across the sarcolemma to the extracellular matrix and on to neighbouring muscle cells. So, during both contraction and relaxation, sarcomere length remains consistent between muscle cells within skeletal muscle.

of the muscle cell at the sarcolemma, in the extracellular matrix (ECM), at the nuclear membrane or within the muscle cell in the sarcoplasm or the sarcomeres, location does not seem to dictate whether a mutant protein can cause MD. Proteins that are involved in

post-translational modifications can also cause MD, as can expansions or deletions of nucleotide-repeat sequences that are not necessarily in protein-coding regions of the genome (BOX 2). For further information about the more common MDs, associated mutant proteins and their known binding partners, see Supplementary information S1 (box) and Supplementary information S2 (table). As we begin to decipher the intricate web of protein interactions within the skeletal-muscle fibre, new strategies for the development of effective treatments for these disorders are becoming apparent (BOX 3).

Dystrophin helps link the ECM and cytoskeleton Despite being the first mutant protein shown to cause MD, the exact function of dystrophin has not yet been elucidated. Dystrophin anchors the sarcolemma to the actin cytoskeleton in the sarcoplasm and therefore has an important structural role during muscle contraction and muscle stretch. Dystrophin is expressed at the sarcolemma and is enriched at the costameres and sites of cell–cell contact, namely the myotendinous junction and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Dystrophin is thought to be an elastic and flexible protein owing to triple helical repeats located in its rod domain14 and therefore dystrophin probably protects the muscle cell from the stresses caused by the force created during muscle contraction. Muscle fibres that lack dystrophin are less stiff than normal fibres15.

The protective role of dystrophin. The N terminus of dystrophin shares high homology with spectrins and α-actinins and therefore dystrophin belongs to the spectrin superfamily11. The N terminus and spectrin repeats of dystrophin bind to the cytoskeleton through filamentous (F)-actin16,17. The ~1,200 amino acids that are found between these two regions of dystrophin provide an extended lateral connection between dystrophin and F-actin, with 1 dystrophin molecule binding to the equivalent of 24 actin monomers, which are present as polymerized actin18 (FIG. 2). The actin that binds to dystrophin (γ-actin) is a different type of actin from that found in the thin filaments of sarcomeres (α-actin)19. Accordingly, in the absence of dystrophin, costameric actin (γ-actin) disappears, whereas the actin in the contractile apparatus (α-actin) is retained19. Dystrophin also binds to dystroglycan through the cysteine-rich domain and to α-dystrobrevin through the C-terminal domain (see FIG. 2); dystroglycan and α-dystrobrevin are involved in various MDs (see below). The C terminus of dystrophin binds to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), a group of proteins that can be purified as a macromolecular structure from muscle-fibre membranes that have been solubilized by detergents20,21. The DAPC consists of cytoplasmic, transmembrane and extracellular proteins, and therefore provides a strong mechanical link and mediates interactions between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the ECM22 (FIGS 2,3).

nNOS interacts with α1-syntrophin and β1-syntrophin26 (FIGS 2,3) and it is thought that the disruption of signalling facilitated by nNOS leads to disease, which emphasizes the role of α-dystrobrevin in signalling. Overexpression of nNOS in dystrophin-deficient mice greatly improves the integrity of the sarcolemma of muscle fibres and therefore lessens the degree of dystrophy, perhaps owing to the anti-inflammatory properties of nNOS27. Syntrophin links to the ECM through dystrophin (two syntrophin proteins bind to one dystrophin protein) and is thought to associate with kinases, ion channels and several signalling proteins (for example, GRB2 (REF. 28)). Therefore, by localizing signalling molecules, syntrophin creates signal-transduction complexes at the DAPC. Knockout mice for either syntrophin29 or nNOS30 do not have an MD phenotype, although they have abnormal NMJs. However, α-syntrophin and nNOS31 are not found at the sarcolemma in the absence of dystrophin, which indicates that the ability of syntrophin to associate with the sarcolemmal DAPC depends solely on its interaction with dystrophin. By contrast, α-syntrophin localizes to the NMJ in the absence of dystrophin, raising the possibility that the protein responsible for its localization at this site is utrophin (a functional autosomal paralogue of dystrophin that is expressed at the NMJ32). The lack of utrophin in the abnormal NMJs of α-syntrophin-knockout mice further supports this notion29. Syntrophin and α-dystrobrevin are required for normal muscle function, despite not obviously having a mechanical role in conjunction with dystrophin, which supports the suggestion that these proteins might have roles in signalling. In the absence of dystrophin, both α-dystrobrevin and α-syntrophin are almost completely lost from the sarcolemma. However, these proteins can be restored at the sarcolemma in mice that express truncated forms of dystrophin transgenes that lack the α-dystrobrevin- and syntrophin-binding sites33. In these mice, the structure and function of the muscle is normal33, indicating that both syntrophin and α-dystrobrevin can function maximally despite losing their link to dystrophin. These findings therefore imply that syntrophin and α-dystrobrevin might have a role(s) other than structural (for example, in signalling) and that syntrophin and α-dystrobrevin associate with the DAPC in other ways apart from through dystrophin. In vitro studies have shown that α-dystrobrevin might associate with the sarcoglycans34. Binding partners of α-dystrobrevin. The other binding partners of α-dystrobrevin include the intermediatefilament proteins synemin35, dysbindin36 and syncoilin37. Syncoilin is localized to the NMJ and costameres and binds to desmin38 (FIG. 3). As desmin interacts directly with proteins at the Z-line of the sarcomere, syncoilin and desmin link α-dystrobrevin at the sarcolemma to the site of contraction. Although the amounts of α-dystrobrevin can be affected in some MDs, mutations in α-dystrobrevin itself have so far only been shown to cause congenital heart disease39. Synemin is present at the sarcomeric Z-line where it binds to desmin, vimentin40 and α-actinin41. Synemin also binds

Figure 2 | Dystrophin binds to the DAPC at the sarcolemma. Dystrophin, which is localized at the sarcolemma, has a long central rod domain made up of spectrin repeats, which are interspersed with hinge regions. The C terminus is preceded by a cysteine-rich domain. Dystrophin binds to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) through its C terminus. The DAPC is comprised of sarcoplasmic proteins (α-dystrobrevin, syntrophins and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)), transmembrane proteins (β-dystroglycan, the sarcoglycans, caveolin-3 and sarcospan) and extracellular proteins (α-dystroglycan and laminin). Many members of the DAPC are also associated with muscular dystrophy, either owing to mutations in the genes that encode them (for example, α-, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan, laminin or caveolin-3), or through mutant binding partners (for example, nNOS, syntrophin, α-dystrobrevin, α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan or sarcospan). The N terminus of dystrophin binds to the cytoskeleton through filamentous (F)-actin. Therefore, the DAPC provides a strong mechanical link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Loss of sarcolemmal integrity is thought to occur when a mutant protein of the DAPC is expressed, resulting in muscle fibres that are more susceptible to damage.

It is thought that mutant protein members of the DAPC cause a loss of sarcolemmal integrity and therefore render muscle fibres more vulnerable to damage23. In the absence of dystrophin, the DAPC becomes destabilized, leading to diminished levels of the other DAPC proteins20,21. Therefore, the protective role of dystrophin and the other members of the DAPC; that is, anchoring the sarcolemma to the internal actin cytoskeleton and to the ECM, is lost. The increasingly fragile sarcolemma is subjected to mechanical injury, which results in progressive muscle-fibre damage and sarcolemmal leakage. Regeneration gradually fails as the pool of endogenous satellite cells ceases to compensate for the damaged muscle fibres. The extent of necrosis and membrane weakness is exacerbated by physical exercise, but is improved by muscle immobilization.

Although the DAPC is retained, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is displaced from the sarcolemma into the sarcoplasm in the absence of α-dystrobrevin24, probably through the loss of the interaction between α-dystrobrevin and syntrophin25.

For simplicity, only one myofibril and one T-tubule are indicated within the sarcoplasm, and the T-tubule has not been drawn the whole way through the myofibre. The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounds the sarcolemma and consists of collagen and laminin. Laminin binds to integrin and α-dystroglycan at the sarcolemma. α-Dystroglycan is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), a group of proteins (including the sarcoglycans and α-dystrobrevin) that binds to dystrophin. Dystrophin links the ECM with the sarcomere where contraction occurs — at the sarcolemma, dystrophin binds to α-dystrobrevin, which in turn binds to syncoilin. Syncoilin interacts with desmin, a protein that localizes to the Z-disk of the sarcomere. This link can also occur through laminin binding to integrin, which in turn binds to filamin-C; this protein binds to myotilin at the sarcomere (not shown). Mutations in proteins that are associated with the nucleus (lamin A and lamin C, PABPN1 and emerin), the sarcoplasmic reticulum (POMT1, DMPK and selenoprotein N) as well as the Golgi apparatus (fukutin, FKRP, POMGnT1 and LARGE) can cause muscular dystrophy when mutated.

The dystroglycans: important DAPC members Loss of dystroglycan results in embryonic lethality in the mouse43, perhaps explaining why no dystroglycan mutations have been identified in humans so far. However, if dystroglycan is selectively disrupted in mature muscle

fibres it leads to an instability and degeneration of the fibres44. Dystroglycan is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan, which remain non-covalently linked45. α-Dystroglycan is attached to the extracellular cell surface through the transmembrane β-dystroglycan subunit, whereas β-dystroglycan binds directly to α-dystrobrevin (FIGS 2,3). The presence of glycan carbohydrate moieties on α-dystroglycan is necessary for binding to ECM proteins such as laminin, agrin and perlecan46. The dystroglycan complex is associated with the sarcoglycan complex (FIGS 2,3).

Box 2 | Repeat instability: expansions and deletions
Expansions or deletions of nucleotide repeats, not necessarily contained within the coding region of a gene, can cause muscular dystrophies (MDs). These repeats are variable in number in the normal human genome and disease has been associated with a decreased or increased number of repeats. The dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK)118 and zinc finger protein-9 (ZNF9)119 genes cause myotonic dystrophy (DM) type-1 and type-2 respectively. DM1 is the most common inherited MD that affects adults. These gene expansions are transcribed into RNA but do not modify the protein-coding region of any other gene. Instead, it has been shown that they modify the splicing of other genes such as the chloride channel (in the case of DM1) and the insulin receptor (in the case of DM2)120, which helps to explain why MD affects other organs in addition to skeletal muscle. An expansion of alanines within the coding region of the poly(A)-binding protein, nuclear-1 gene (PABPN1) produces MD121. The ubiquitously expressed PABPN1 is involved in mRNA synthesis and trafficking and regulates the length of mRNA poly(A) tails122. The normal protein can shuttle between the nucleus and the sarcoplasm123; however, PABPN1 expansions cause filamentous intranuclear aggregates that concentrate into discrete ‘speckles’ in the nucleus124. Deletions of repeated 3.3-kb units located on chromosome 4 (4q35.2) also cause MD125. As no transcribed genes have been identified within these repeats, one suggestion is that the deleted repeats derepress neighbouring genes by a position effect and lead to their upregulation (reviewed in REF. 126). Transgenic mice that overexpress one of these genes, FRG1, develop an MD similar to facioscapulohumeral MD in humans127, indicating that dysregulation of FRG1 might be the cause of this MD. FRG1 is a nuclear protein that is thought to splice pre-mRNA and aberrant splicing of genes was confirmed in this study in the affected mice127.

The expression of mutant dystrophin proteins that lack the ability to bind to β-dystroglycan produces a marked loss of all sarcoglycan proteins, as well as α-dystroglycan47, indicating that the sarcoglycan complex is assembled and anchored in the DAPC through β-dystroglycan. The sarcoglycan complex. In skeletal and cardiac muscle the predominant sarcoglycan complex consists of β-sarcoglycan and δ-sarcoglycan together as a core, bound by α-sarcoglycan and γ-sarcoglycan48 (FIGS 2,3). Despite being transmembrane components of the DAPC, none of the sarcoglycans bind to dystrophin directly in vivo. The absence of dystrophin usually initiates disruption and destabilization of the sarcoglycan complex, making the sarcolemma leaky. Mutations in the genes that encode α-, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan cause limb girdle MDs (reviewed in REF. 49; see Supplementary information S2 (table)). In most instances the protein encoded by the mutated sarcoglycan gene is absent in patients with MD, with a reduction or complete loss of the other sarcoglycans. Although the exact function of the sarcoglycan complex is not known, it seems to have mechanical, non-mechanical and signalling roles50. At the surface of the muscle cell, each member of the sarcoglycan complex forms a functional unit by associating closely with sarcospan, which has four transmembrane regions51 (FIGS 2,3). Extracellularly, the sarcoglycan complex binds to a small proteoglycan, biglycan, through α-sarcoglycan and γ-sarcoglycan52 and through biglycan the sarcoglycan complex then binds to α-dystroglycan (FIG. 3). Intracellularly, the sarcoglycan complex interacts with the cytoskeletal protein filamin-C through the sarcoplasmic tails of γ-sarcoglycan and δ-sarcoglycan53 (FIG. 3). Filamin-C also binds to the integrin complex and closely links to the sarcomere through the Z-line53 (FIG. 3). In dystrophin-deficient mice, filamin-C is upregulated and recruited away from the sarcomere to the sarcolemma53.

Caveolin-3 and dysferlin. The β-dystroglycan subunit also binds to caveolin-3 in the DAPC, as well as the adaptor protein GRB2 (FIG. 3)54. Caveolin-3 is the muscle-specific isoform of the caveolin family55 and is the main structural component of caveolae at the sarcolemma. Caveolin-3 is also located in T-tubules during muscle development and therefore it is not surprising that caveolin-3-null mice have T-tubule defects56. Other putative functions of caveolin-3 include inhibition of nNOS enzymatic activity57, interactions with several signalling molecules58 and involvement in the regulation of energy metabolism59. Overexpression of caveolin-3 results in an MD phenotype in mice, leading to a marked reduction in the amounts of dystrophin and other DAPC members60. These findings might result from the excess caveolin-3 displacing dystrophin as both proteins bind to the same site on β-dystroglycan61. As β-dystroglycan anchors dystrophin to the sarcolemma, this linkage is destroyed or reduced and therefore results in a dystrophic phenotype. By contrast, dominant expression of mutant caveolin-3 proteins in patients with MD often causes a loss or reduction of the total amounts of caveolin-3, but preservation of dystrophin and the DAPC62. However, sometimes α-dystroglycan and nNOS are selectively absent63 or dysferlin is mislocalized64. Dominant expression of a mutant caveolin-3 protein can result in targeting of the mutant caveolin-3 as well as the wild-type caveolin-3 to the proteasomal-degradation pathway, with retention at the Golgi complex65, which explains the absence of both these proteins in the sarcolemma of patients. Caveolin-3 binds to dysferlin64, which is a ubiquitously expressed member of the ferlin protein family. The novel, integrin-linked kinase-binding protein affixin was recently identified as a binding partner for dysferlin66 (FIG. 3). As affixin also interacts with α-actinin and F-actin67, it links integrin, dysferlin and caveolin-3 to the cytoskeleton. However, dysferlin mutations are not thought to cause MD solely through a disruption of the link between integrins and the cytoskeleton. Instead, there is strong evidence that MD probably arises owing

Box 3 | Potential therapies for MDs
Currently there is no cure for any of the muscular dystrophies (MDs), with only palliative and symptomatic treatment available for patients. The identification of the causative gene for Duchenne MD and Becker MD nearly 20 years ago was accompanied by a surge of optimism that a therapy or cure would soon follow. Unfortunately, translating the knowledge of the causative gene and its mutation into genetic therapy for MDs has proven to be a difficult task. There have been studies of possible treatments that function at the molecular level (chimeroplasts, short fragment homologous recombination and antisense oligonucleotide exon skipping), the cellular level (delivery of myoblasts, stem cells, viruses and plasmids) and the pharmacological level (myostatin blockade, upregulation of an alternative gene, proteasomedegradation prevention and stop-codon read-through using aminoglycoside antibiotics) (reviewed in REFS 128,129). Two promising therapeutic approaches are the delivery of a normal replacement for the defective gene using adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors130 and the use of antisense oligonucleotides to induce exon skipping of the mutationcontaining exon or to extend a deletion. This produces an in-frame transcript that is translated into a functional, albeit smaller, protein131. One of the main hurdles facing therapeutic approaches is effective delivery of the therapeutic product to skeletal muscle, which makes up 30–40% of the total human body mass. Fortunately, recent success with systemic delivery has shown significant promise. For example, weekly intravenous injections of a morpholino oligonucleotide into the dystrophin-null mouse model, mdx, produced body-wide expression of dystrophin132. Also, a single injection of an AAV8 virus into hamsters produced sustained expression of the previously missing δ-sarcoglycan protein in both skeletal muscle and heart for longer than 12 months133. A novel combination of both viral delivery and antisense technology was accomplished in mdx mice, in which a single tail-vein injection of an AAV vector expressing an antisense U1 small nuclear RNA led to successful body-wide expression of a dystrophin isoform for at least 12 weeks134.

to defective muscle-membrane repair and maintenance processes68. Although, to survive, all cells must have a fast and proficient way to reseal their membranes after injury, highly active tissues such as skeletal muscle have a more crucial need for this repair process. A membraneresealing action that requires Ca2+ is disrupted in mouse myofibres that lack dysferlin68.

Myoblast
An undifferentiated, mononucleated cell that is a precursor of a muscle cell.

Glycosylation of α-dystroglycan Although the primary sequence of α-dystroglycan is predicted to have a molecular mass of 72 kDa, the molecular mass in mammalian skeletal muscle is 156 kDa, which reflects post-translational modifications (predominantly O-linked glycosylation)45,69. No human disease has been shown to be caused by dystroglycan mutations so far, but many proteins that glycosylate α-dystroglycan, or are thought to do so, have been identified as causing MD when mutated70. Aberrant glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (but not β-dystroglycan) is the primary cause of a range of MDs that are characterized by muscle weakness and sometimes by brain and ocular abnormalities71–77. Common to all these disorders is a uniform or variable reduction of glycosylation, which produces an α-dystroglycan protein that is less glycosylated70. This decrease in glycosylation affects the binding of α-dystroglycan to agrin, laminin and neurexin. Proteins of the Golgi apparatus and the sarcoplasmic reticulum mediate post-translational modifications, such as the attachment of carbohydrate molecules to form glycoproteins. Mutations in four proteins of the Golgi apparatus (fukutin, fukutin-related protein (FKRP), LARGE and protein O-linked mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1)) and two proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (protein O-mannosyltransferase-1 (POMT1) and selenoprotein N) have been shown to cause an MD phenotype. Although the exact biochemical function of each of these proteins remains unknown, all except selenoprotein N are glycoproteins that potentially modify and process α-dystroglycan post-translationally.

Proteins of the Golgi apparatus. The LARGE gene was initially identified as having deletions in meningioma tumours, and is ubiquitously expressed, although the LARGE protein is most predominantly found in skeletal muscle, heart and brain and this protein is predicted to have two putative glycosyltransferase domains78. POMGnT1 is constitutively expressed and is involved in the synthesis of O-mannose glycan79, a reaction that is rarely found in mammals, although O-mannose glycan is a laminin-binding ligand of α-dystroglycan 80. MD arises from loss-of-function mutations in the POMGnT1 gene and patients have reduced amounts of α-dystroglycan and laminin-α2 (REF. 79). Fukutin, which is thought to have a role in neuronal migration, has a hydrophobic Golgi-signal-anchor sequence that coincides with its transmembrane region and so is found in secretory granules and Golgi bodies81,82. Similar to patients with POMGnT1 mutations, patients with a mutant fukutin gene have reduced amounts of α-dystroglycan and laminin-α2 and therefore have a disrupted basal lamina83. FKRP is highly enriched in skeletal muscle and heart75. Although the enzymatic activity of FKRP has not yet been proven, an alteration of dystroglycan processing was seen after overexpression of FKRP in vitro81. Patients with FKRP mutations have a variable reduction of laminin-α2 and α-dystroglycan levels84; the severity of α-dystroglycan depletion directly correlates with the severity of the MD phenotype85. O-mannosylation: from yeasts to humans. Protein O-mannosyltransferases are conserved throughout evolution from yeasts to humans and have been shown to be crucial in yeasts owing to their important roles in the maintenance of cell integrity and cell-wall rigidity. Although rare in humans, O-mannosylation occurs in skeletal muscle, brain and nerve. In mammals, POMT1 and POMT2 are both required for O-mannosyltransferase activity, which produces a functional α-dystroglycan86. Mutant POMT1 proteins cause a range of congenital

MDs with variable severity, some of which can be associated with mental retardation87. Patients with POMT1 mutations lack glycosylated α-dystroglycan74. The glycosylation of α-dystroglycan is essential for its interaction with intracellular and extracellular binding partners. An increasing number of potential glycoproteins have been identified, which when mutated lead to disruption of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and subsequent MD, indicating similar pathways of disease pathogenesis.

Sarcomere-associated proteins and MD Myotilin, telethonin, titin, the Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ-motif protein (ZASP; also known as cypher), calpain-3 and tripartite motif-32 (TRIM32) are all sarcomere-associated proteins that are involved in MDs. Calpain-3 and TRIM32 are also found in the sarcoplasm.
Anchoring titin. Telethonin is implicated in signal transmission in myofibrillogenesis and it anchors titin to the Z-line96. Telethonin interacts with the growth factor myostatin, which is a negative regulator of myoblast proliferation and therefore probably promotes muscle regeneration and growth97. MD patients with an absence of telethonin have preservation of Z-lines and other sarcomeric features as well as retention of DAPC members at the sarcolemma98. This finding indicates that MD arises from disruption of the signalling roles, rather than the structural roles, of telethonin. A Ser residue near the C terminus of telethonin (Ser157) is phosphorylated by the kinase activity of titin in early differentiating myocytes99. Titin is the largest protein known, having a molecular weight in humans of 4,200 kDa. Titin forms a continuous filament system with each titin molecule spanning half a sarcomere from the Z-disk to the M-line. It is known as a ‘molecular spring’ because its I-band region has elastic properties and as a ‘ruler’ because it functions as a principal sarcomeric template and stabilizer during myofibrillogenesis. Recent findings indicate that, owing to its pseudosymmetric structure, telethonin mediates the antiparallel assembly of two titin molecules, perhaps explaining how sarcomeric filaments are crosslinked and stabilized100. The most N-terminal 30 kDa of titin proteins from adjacent sarcomeres are anchored at the Z-line; the proteins continue for approximately 1 µm until the C-terminal 250 kDa regions of opposing titins localize at the M-line, the middle of the sarcomere where actin and myosin filaments overlap. Proteins that affect sarcomere formation. The C terminus of titin binds to calpain-3. The calpains are intracellular, Ca2+-activated, non-lysosomal cysteine proteases that function in several signalling pathways. Calpain-3 is the sole skeletal-muscle-specific isoform101 and cleaves the C-terminal portion of filamin-C, moderating the interaction between filamin-C and the sarcoglycans102 (FIG. 3). Filamin-C binds to the sarcoglycan proteins and to integrin89 at the sarcolemma, and also to myotilin103 and FATZ1 (filamin, actin and telethonin-binding protein at the Z-disk) at the sarcomere89. Patients with titin mutations can have a secondary calpain-3 deficiency104. Calpain-3 is implicated in processes that involve remodelling of the cytoskeleton during myoblast fusion and repair. Mutated calpain-3 was the first enzyme, rather than a structural protein, to be associated with MD101. An increase in apoptosis is seen in muscle that is deficient in calpain-3 (REF. 105) with studies in mice indicating that calpain-3 is required for sarcomere formation and the maintenance of sarcomeric structural integrity106, perhaps owing to its binding with titin.

Basement membrane
Amorphous extracellular matrix material, composed of proteins such as collagen, laminin and fibronectin, that surrounds individual muscle fibres. It is comprised of two layers, the basal lamina and the reticular lamina.

Myofibrillogenesis
The transition from premyofibril to myofibril, which is a long, highly organized bundle of contractile proteins or filaments in the sarcoplasm of the myofibre.

ECM proteins associated with MD The ECM enhances the elastic properties of myofibres, adds strength to the sarcolemma and is involved in tissue differentiation, repair and regeneration. The ECM is composed of a meshwork of insoluble proteins with carbohydrate chains, such as collagen, proteoglycans, laminins and fibronectins. Among the ECM proteins, collagen VI and laminin have been identified as causing MD when mutated. Collagen VI is a ubiquitous cell-adhesion protein that does not bind directly to the DAPC. It forms a microfibrillar network in the ECM in close association with the basement membrane where it interacts with many other proteins. Laminin-α2 forms the link between α-dystroglycan at the sarcolemma and the basal lamina45 (FIGS 2,3) and has a role in organizing a structured basement membrane as well as linking the basement membrane from neighbouring cells through receptors on the cell surface. Laminin-α2 also binds to the heterodimeric receptor α7β1 integrin at the sarcolemma88, which in turn binds to filamin-C89 (see below and FIG. 3). Interaction between α7β1 integrin and laminin-2 seems to be essential for the maintenance of mature skeletal muscle90. Integrin binds to laminin in the ECM through an extracellular domain, whereas intracellularly it interacts with cytoskeletal actin through molecules such as talin91 (FIG. 3). Upregulation of α7β1 integrin has been observed in muscle biopsies from patients with DMD92. Despite the mechanism being unknown, amelioration of the severe phenotype of mice lacking both dystrophin and utrophin was achieved when these mice were crossed with transgenic mice that overexpress α7BX2 integrin93. Double α7 integrin- and γ-sarcoglycan-knockout mice have profound, rapid muscle degeneration, which leads to death before 1 month of age94, which indicates a weakened cellular attachment to the ECM. Proteins of the sarcolemma and ECM have traditionally been those most readily associated with MDs, especially as many were first identified owing to their involvement in these diseases. As the pathogenesis of MD involves weakened muscle-cell membranes, it is perhaps not difficult to understand how mutant sarcolemmal and ECM proteins would cause this defect. However, more recently, mutations in genes that encode proteins of other cell compartments, such as the sarcomere (which has been conventionally associated with muscle diseases other than dystrophies, such as the myopathies95), have been shown to produce MDs. These findings have broadened our knowledge of disease mechanisms in skeletal muscle.

TRIM32 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that is involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway of protein degradation107. TRIM32 binds to the head and neck region of myosin and ubiquitylates actin, a finding which led to the suggestion that TRIM32 is involved in the maintenance and degradation of myofibrils during muscle remodelling107. It is hypothesized that disruption of the ubiquitin-degradation pathway leads to a disruption of the internal equilibrium of myofibre proteins. Myotilin (which is a myofibrillar protein with titinlike immunoglobulin domains) is thought to have a crucial role during sarcomere assembly by stabilizing and anchoring thin filaments at the Z-line — patients with myotilin mutations show Z-line streaming and myofibre degeneration108. Myotilin is expressed mainly in striated muscle; its N-terminal half binds to α-actinin109 and its C terminus binds to filamin-C103, with myotilin, α-actinin and filamin-C all binding to actin. α-Actinin is the main Z-line protein, which explains the Z-line streaming seen in patients with myotilin mutations. ZASP is also located at the Z-line and binds to α-actinin110. It is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and, like nNOS and syntrophin, it contains PDZ motifs110. Mutations in these proteins that are at the ‘frontline’ of muscle contraction, that is, at the sarcomere, cause MD. Similar to proteins of the DAPC, it is now recognized that sarcomeric proteins not only have important structural roles but also have signalling roles, such as those involved in muscle-cell proliferation, fusion, maintenance, regeneration and repair. It is perhaps defects in these signalling functions that are more likely to produce MD. that the nuclear envelope of muscle cells is more susceptible to the absence of emerin than other cell types. Alternatively, there might be as-yet-unknown interactions between emerin and other muscle-specific proteins that are disrupted only in muscle, or there might be a functionally similar protein(s) in non-striatedmuscle cells that can compensate for the absence of emerin. As muscle nuclei endure external physical forces during contraction, mechanical destruction owing to a weakened lamina is likely to be a pathological cause of these types of MD. Emerin-null mice do not have any overt phenotype despite abnormal amounts of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb1) and MyoD115. Both Rb1 and MyoD regulate muscle differentiation and are crucial for muscle development. As a result, the emerin-null mice show a delay in the rate of both muscle regeneration and myotube formation115. These findings indicate that loss of emerin produces inefficient responses to differentiation signals when cells are required to exit from the cell cycle and begin to terminally differentiate115. Lamins are associated with many diseases. Lamins provide the nuclear envelope with mechanical stability by forming a meshwork arrangement, the nuclear lamina, under the inner nuclear membrane. As discussed above, LMNA (which encodes lamin A and lamin C) is a perfect example of how the same mutant gene can be involved in a spectrum of clinical phenotypes with a range of age of onsets, severities and rates of progression. So far, a genotype–phenotype correlation between mutant lamin A and lamin C and the tissue-specific diseases they cause has not been elucidated. It is unknown why only certain muscles of the body are affected in some diseases when the causative mutant protein is expressed ubiquitously. A possible explanation could be that certain mutations disrupt interactions with binding partners that are found only in some tissues (and therefore only these tissues are affected) or, conversely, that selective tissues have compensatory proteins that protect that particular tissue from disease. The exact reasons for the differing disease phenotypes remain to be unravelled. An in-depth microarray study using muscle mRNA from patients with a range of neuromuscular disorders has shown that, similar to emerin, mutations in LMNA lead to disruption of the interaction between the nuclear envelope and Rb1 and MyoD116. In support of this finding, a decrease in the amounts of MyoD and therefore decreased differentiation potential was found in myoblasts that were deficient for lamin A and lamin C117. The similar expression profiles revealed by these two studies indicate that mutations in two different genes might cause MD through a common pathway.

How do nuclear proteins cause MD? Each skeletal-muscle fibre is multinucleated as these cells originate from the fusion of many myoblasts. Lamin A, lamin C, emerin and nesprin all contribute to the nuclear membrane and nuclear envelope, which link the cytoskeleton to the inside of the nucleus, maintain the physical architecture of the nucleus and function as a scaffold for other nuclear proteins that are involved in transcription, DNA replication and chromatin organization. Emerin and lamin A and C interact with each other directly, are localized at the inner nuclear membrane in almost all tissues and cause MD when mutated3,10.
Emerin is involved in differentiation. Although the exact function of emerin has not yet been elucidated, proposed functions include nuclear assembly, stabilization of the nuclear envelope and the regulation of gene expression111. Both emerin and lamin C must bind to lamin A for correct localization to the nuclear envelope112. Most mutations in the emerin gene result in a deficiency of emerin protein113, which makes nuclei more fragile because of destabilization of the peripheral nuclear lamina114. Although emerin is ubiquitously expressed, the complete loss of emerin seems to affect skeletal and cardiac muscle only. Why emerin mutations selectively affect certain organs is so far unclear; however, it is possible

Z-line streaming
A common pathological feature in which the dense Z-line material extends into one or both of the adjacent I-bands and, in advanced cases, into the whole sarcomere.

PDZ motif
Protein–protein interaction domain that is thought to have a role in directing intracellular proteins to several protein complexes.

Conclusions Several proteins of the skeletal-muscle fibre can produce one or more types of MD when mutated. A dystrophic phenotype can occur owing to expression of a mutant protein at the sarcolemma, the sarcomere, the nuclear membrane or the sarcoplasm. More than one gene can cause the same clinical disease and, furthermore, the

same gene can produce a spectrum of MD phenotypes, as well as diseases that do not necessarily affect the musculature. The field has moved forward from a belief that MDs are caused predominantly by absent or defective structural proteins to a realization that signalling molecules, enzymes and proteins involved in post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, also cause MDs. The study of MD is leading to a better understanding of skeletal-muscle function through the analysis of muscle dysfunction. However, the causative mechanisms behind some MDs remain to be elucidated. Although no curative therapy is currently available for any of the MDs, immense progress is being made using several approaches (BOX 3). The more we improve therapeutic delivery systems and the more we understand about the protein network of the skeletal-muscle fibre, the better armed we shall be in the crusade against MD.
