Nanoscale Platforms for Medical Research

Molecular or personalized medicine is the future of patient management and
molecular imaging plays a key role towards this goal. Recently, nanoplatform-based molecular imaging has emerged as an interdisciplinary field, which involves chemistry, engineering, biology, and medicine. Possessing unprecedented potential for early detection, accurate diagnosis, and personalized treatment of diseases, nanoplatforms have been employed in every single biomedical imaging modality, namely, optical imaging, computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, singlephoton-emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. Multifunctionality is the key advantage of nanoplatforms over traditional approaches. Targeting ligands, imaging labels, therapeutic drugs, and many other agents can all be integrated into the nanoplatform to allow for targeted molecular imaging and molecular therapy by encompassing many biological and biophysical barriers. In this Review, we will summarize the current stateof-the-art of nanoplatforms for targeted molecular imaging in living subjects.

1. Introduction
Nanotechnology, an interdisciplinary research field involving chemistry, engineering, biology, medicine, and more, has great potential for early detection, accurate diagnosis, and personalized treatment of diseases. Nanoscale devices are typically smaller than several hundred nanometers and are comparable to the size of large biological molecules such as enzymes, receptors, and antibodies. With a size about 100 to 10 000 times smaller than human cells, these nanoscale devices can offer unprecedented interactions with biomolecules both on the surface of and inside cells, which may revolutionize disease diagnosis and treatment. The most well-studied nanomaterials include quantum dots (QDs),[1, 2] carbon nanotubes,[3, 4] nanoshells,[5] paramagnetic nanoparticles,[6] and many others (Figure 1).[7, 8] Over the last decade, there have been numerous nanotechnology centers established worldwide.[9, 10] In the United States alone, more than $ 6 bn has been invested in nanotechnology research and more than sixty centers, networks, and facilities, funded by various agencies, are in operation or soon to open.[11] After establishing an interdisciplinary nanotechnology workforce, it is expected that nanotechnology will mature into a clinically useful field in the near future. One of the major applications of nanotechnology is in biomedicine. Nanoparticles can be engineered as nanoplatforms for effective and targeted delivery of drugs and imaging labels by overcoming the many biological, biophysical, and biomedical barriers. For in vitro and ex vivo applications, the advantages of state-of-the-art nanodevices (nanochips, nanosensors, and so on) over traditional assay methods are obvious.[8, 12] Several barriers exist for in vivo applications in preclinical animal models and eventually clinical translation of nanotechnology, among which are the biocompatibility, in vivo kinetics, targeting efficacy, acute and chronic toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. In this Review, we will summarize the current state-of-the-art of nanoplatforms for targeted molecular imaging in living subjects.

2. Molecular Imaging
Molecular imaging refers to the characterization and measurement of biological processes at the cellular and/or molecular level.[13, 14] It can give whole-body readout in an intact system, dramatically decrease the workload and reduce the cost of biomedical research and drug development, provide more statistically relevant results since longitudinal studies can be performed in the same animals, aid in early lesion detection in patients and patient stratification, and help in individualized treatment monitoring and dose optimization.[15] Molecular imaging modalities include optical bioluminescence, optical fluorescence, targeted ultrasound, molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET).[14] Many hybrid systems that combine two or more of these modalities are already commercially available and a few others are under active development.[16–18] Although computed tomography (CT) is generally not considered as a molecular imaging modality, the use of nanoparticles as CT contrast agents will be included in this Review. The use of a molecularly targeted nanoplatform affords many advantages over conventional approaches. First, hundreds, thousands, or even more imaging labels or a combination of labels for different imaging modalities can be attached to a single nanoparticle, which can lead to dramatic signal amplification. Second, multiple, potentially different, targeting ligands on the nanoparticle can provide enhanced binding affinity and specificity. Third, the ability to integrate a means to bypass biological barriers can enable enhanced targeting efficacy. Ultimately, the combination of different targeting ligands, imaging labels, therapeutic drugs, and many other agents may allow for effective and conACHTUNGREtrolled delivery of therapeutic agents in patients, which can be noninvasively monitored in real time. With continuous efforts by multidisciplinary approaches, the use of nanoplatform will shed new light on molecular diagnostics and molecular therapy. Nanoparticles usually suffer from poorer extravasation when compared to small molecules or proteins. Thus, the

majority of naoplatform-based research is so far limited to vasculature-related diseases. In the context of cancer, nanoparticles may also be delivered to tumors through passive targeting mechanisms based on enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects.[19, 20] This Review will focus on targeted molecular imaging, and the passive targeting of nanoplatforms will only be briefly mentioned where appropriate.

3. Optical Imaging
Optical imaging is a relatively low-cost method suitable primarily for small-animal studies. In fluorescence imaging, excitation light illuminates the subject and the emission light is collected at a shifted wavelength.[21] The major disadvantage of fluorescence imaging is that it is typically not quantitative and the image information is surface-weighted due to tissue absorption.[13] In most cases, significant background signal is also observed because of tissue autofluorescence. A few recently developed techniques such as spectral imaging, where fluorescence signals can be separated based on the emission spectra of different fluorophores,[22, 23] and fluorescence-mediated tomography[24, 25] can significantly help interpreting the fluorescence imaging data.

3.1. Quantum Dots The most widely studied nanoparticles for optical imaging applications are quantum dots. QDs are inorganic fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles with many superior properties for biological imaging than organic fluorophores, such as high quantum yields, high molar extinction coefficients, strong resistance to photobleaching and chemical degradation, continuous absorption spectra spanning UV to near-infrared (NIR; 700–900 nm), long fluorescence lifetimes (> 10 ns), narrow emission spectra (typically 20–30 nm full width at half maximum), and large effective Stokes shifts.[26–28] Numerous in vitro and cell-based applications have been discovered for QDs.[29–31] QDs also have a sizedependent two-photon absorption cross section as high as 47 000 Goeppert–Mayer units, two to three orders of magni-

As the Modeling studies have revealed that two spectral windows exist for optimal QD-based imaging in living subjects, one at 700–900 nm and the other at 1 200–1 600 nm.[35] For in vivo applications, non-targeted QDs have been reported for cell trafficking,[36–38] vasculature imaging,[33, 39, 40] sentinel lymph node mapping,[41–44] and neural imaging.[45, 46] In order to make QDs more useful for biomedical Figure 2.

To date, there have been only a handful of successful reports in the literature. 3.3. Antibody-Conjugated Quantum Dots 3.2. Peptide-Conjugated Quantum Dots Specific targeting of QD conjugates in living subjects was first reported using peptides as the targeting ligands.[47] In this pioneering study, ex vivo histological analysis showed that QDs were specifically directed to the tumor vasculature and other targets by different peptides. Although no in vivo imaging was achieved, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using QD as a nanoplatform for in vivo specific targeting, which opened up a new field of QD-based research. Recently, Cai et al. reported the in vivo targeted imaging of tumor vasculature using peptide-conjugated QDs.[48] Integrin avb3, a cell adhesion molecule, is overexpressed on activated endothelial cells and tumor cells but is not readily detectACHTUNGREable in resting endothelial cells and most normal organ systems.[49] Many previous reports have demonstrated that integrin avb3 is an excellent target for imaging purposes.[50–52] The fact that integrin avb3 is expressed on both tumor vasculature and tumor cells makes it a prime target for nanoplatform-based imaging, as extravasation is not required to observe tumor signal. In this study, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD; potent integrin avb3 antagonist) containing peptides were conjugated to QD705 (emission maximum at 705 nm) and QD705-RGD exhibited high affinity integrin avb3 specific binding in cell culture and ex vivo. In vivo NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was successfully achieved in nude mice bearing subcutaneous integrin avb3-positive

QDs have been conjugated to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-specific monoclonal antibodies for prostate cancer targeting and imaging in mice.[53] Multiplexed imaging was also demonstrated using various QD-labeled cancer cells. In this study, both passive targeting and active targeting mechanisms were investigated using QDs with different surface ligands. Since no histological analysis was carried out to investigate PSMA expression on the tumor cells and tumor vasculature, it was unclear whether these QD conjugates targeted the tumor vasculature or tumor cells. In a recent study, QDs were linked to an antiAFP (alpha-fetoprotein, a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines) antibody for in vivo tumor imaging.[54] Using an integrated fluorescence imaging system, spectroscopic hepatoma imaging was achieved and the heterogeneous distribution of the QD-based probe in the tumor was also evaluated by a site-by-site measurement method. The major flaw of this study is that it was not shown whether or not the anti-AFP antibody was actually linked to the QD. Therefore, there is not enough experimental evidence to support the conclusion that the tumor contrast observed was from active, rather than passive, targeting. Tracking the movement of a single QD–antibody conjugate (total number of QD particles injected was % 1.2  1014) inside the tumor through a dorsal skinfold chamber was recently accomplished using a high-speed confocal microscope with a high sensitivity camera.[55] This technique was able to

capture the specific delivery of a single QD particle entering into circulation, extravasating into the interstitial space from the vasculature, binding to the tumor cell surface receptor, and reaching the perinuclear region after traveling on the intracellular rail protein. However, this study did not provide any information regarding the percentage of intravenously injected QDs that extravasated. Thus, little can be concluded about the overall behavior of such QD–antibody conjugates in vivo. Whether the described delivery pattern is typical for the majority of injected QD conjugates, or if it is only limited to a very small subset of QDs, remains to be elucidated in the future. QD-based fluorescence imaging in small animals can not be directly scaled up to in vivo imaging in patients due to the limited optical signal penetration depth. In clinical settings, optical imaging is relevant for tissues close to the surface of the skin, tissues accessible by endoscopy, and during intraoperative visualization. QD-based imaging may play an important role in image-guided surgery in the future. The major roadblocks for clinical translation of QDs are inefficient delivery, potential toxicity, and lack of quantification.[31] However, with the development of smaller,[42, 56] less toxic,[43, 57] multifunctional[58, 59] QDs and further improvement of the conjugation strategy, it is expected that QDs may achieve optimal tumor targeting efficacy with acceptable toxicity profile for clinical translation in the near future.

of an object from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation.[67] CT is not a molecular imaging modality yet due to the lack of targetspecific contrast agents. Current CT contrast agents are typically based on iodine and gadolinium-based molecules, which have mostly nonspecific distribution and rapid pharmacokinetics.[68, 69] Iodinated nanoparticles have also been reported as CT contrast agents.[70–75] Recently, detection of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of rabbits, following intravenous injection of a contrast agent formed of iodinated nanoparticles dispersed with surfactant, was achieved with a clinical CT scanner (Figure 3).[76] This contrast agent may become an important adjunct to the clinical evaluation of coronary arteries with CT.

3.4. Other Nanoparticles Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique with high resolution (typically 10–15 mm), which can allow for real-time, cross-sectional imaging through biological tissues.[60, 61] OCT detects the reflection of a low-coherence light source directed into a tissue and determines at what depth the reflections occurred. Nanoshells[62, 63] and gold nanocages[64] have been reported for OCT imaging in vitro. The surface plasmon resonance properties of these nanoparticles make them promising both as contrast agents for in vivo optical imaging, and as therapeutic agents for photothermal treatment of diseases.[65] Although having great potential, efficient targeted delivery of these nanoparticles in vivo, a goal central to any potential therapeutics, has not been demonstrated. Much future effort is needed to evaluate the fate and biological effects of such nanoparticles in animals before any biomedical applications can be in place. In another study, ligand-conjugated, NIR-labeled lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) nanoparticles that enable the in vivo demonstration of rerouting LDL from LDL receptors to selected alternate receptors were recently reported.[66] This approach may expand the range of using LDL particles as nanoplatforms for in vivo cancer imaging and treatment.

To date, all contrast-enhanced CT imaging are based on nonspecific targeting and no molecular CT has been reported. A polymer-coated Bi2S3 nanoparticle (10–50 nm per side, 3–4 nm thick) was recently reported as an injectable CT contrast agent.[77] With more than a fivefold increase in X-ray absorption than iodine, very long circulation times ACHTUNGRE(>2 h) in vivo, and an efficacy/safety profile comparable to or better than iodinated contrast agents, these nanoparticles and their bioconjugates may potentially be used for CT

imaging of molecular targets and pathological conditions. Because of the ubiquitous nature of CT in the clinical setting, as well as the increasing use and development of microCT and hybrid systems that combine PET or SPECT with CT, molecular CT will likely become a reality in the near future.

5. Targeted Ultrasound
Because of its safety, low cost, ease of use, and wide availability, ultrasonography is the most commonly used clinical imaging modality.[78] High-frequency sound waves are emitted from a transducer placed against the skin and ultrasound images are obtained based on the sound wave reflected back from the internal organs. The contrast of ultrasound is dependent on the sound speed, sound attenuation, backscatter, and the imaging algorithm.[79] Ultrasound contrast agents have been used in the clinic for applications such as blood pool enhancement, characterization of liver lesions, and perfusion imaging.[80, 81] These contrast agents are generally in the form of small acoustically active particles ranging from several hundred nanometers to a few micrometers in diameter. Microbubbles resonate in an ultrasound beam, rapidly contracting and expanding in response to the pressure changes of the sound wave, thus leading to enhanced ultrasound contrast.[82] Targeting is accomplished either through manipulating the chemical properties of the microbubble shell or through conjugation of disease-specific ligands to the microbubble surface.[78, 83] As these microbubbles are too large to extravasate, the disease process must be characterized by molecular changes in the vascular compartment to be imaged. Integrin avb3 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2; Flk1/KDR) targeted ultrasound have been reported using ligand-conjugated microbubbles.[84–88] Ligand-coated perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion nanoparticles ( % 250 nm in diameter) were used to identify the angioplasty-induced expression of tissue factor by smooth muscle cells within the tunica media (Figure 4).[89, 90] Pig carotid arteries were overstretched bilaterally with balloon catheters, treated with a tissue factor-targeted or a control nanoparticle system, and imaged with intravascular ultrasound (20 MHz) before and after treatment. Tissue factortargeted nanoparticles bound to and increased the echogenicity of tissue factor expressing smooth muscle cells within the tunica media. The area of acoustic enhancement also appeared to coincide with the expression of induced tissue factor as revealed by immunohistochemistry. Detection of neovasculature in tumors implanted in athymic nude mice has also been achieved using a research ultrasound scanner after injection of targeted PFC nanoparticles.[91] Ultrasound has relatively high spatial resolution (typically < 500 mm) yet it also has some disadvantages such as relatively poor depth penetration (usually a few centimeters depending on the frequency used) and limited sensitivity.[14] Due to the large size of the contrast agents used (usually > 200 nm), the molecular targets are exclusively vasculature related. Disruption of the microbubbles or nanoparticles

[89, 90]).

after reaching the targeted vasculature may potentially be employed for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.

6. Molecular MRI
MRI is a noninvasive diagnostic technique based on the interaction of certain nuclei (typically protons) with each other and with surrounding molecules in a tissue of interest.[92] Different tissues have different relaxation times, which can result in endogenous contrast. Exogenous contrast agents can further enhance this by selectively shortening either the T1 (longitudinal) or T2 (transverse) relaxation time.[93, 94] The MR image can be weighted to detect differences in either T1 or T2 by adjusting parameters during data acquisition. Traditionally, gadolinium chelates have been used to increase the T1 contrast.[95] Recently, novel MR contrast agents with significantly higher relaxivities have been reported, such as paramagnetic gadolinium-containing liposomes/micelles and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles.[6, 93] The major advantages of MRI over radionuclide-based imaging are the absence of radiation and higher spatial resolution (usually sub-millimeter level). The disadvantage of MRI is its inherent low sensitivity, which can only be partially compensated by working at higher magnetic fields (4.7–14 T), acquiring data for much longer periods during imaging, and using exogenous contrast agents.

6.1. Non-Targeted MR Contrast Agents Iron oxide nanoparticles are the most widely used nanoparticle-based MR contrast agents. Since nanoparticles are usually nonspecifically taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES)[96] and the overall size of the nanoparticle can affect which organ (liver, spleen, or lymph node) they go to, non-targeted iron oxide nanoparticles have been used for liver,[97, 98] spleen,[99, 100] and lymph node imaging.[101, 102] These nanoparticles can also accumulate at the tumor site due to the presence of leaky vasculature (the extent of extravasation depends on the porosity of the angiogenic tumor vessels) as well as from macrophage uptake.[103–105] The role of macrophages in pathologic tissue alterations in the central nervous system has led to the use of SPIO agents for imaging of stroke,[106] multiple sclerosis,[107] brain tumors,[108] and carotid atherosclerotic plaques.[109] Iron oxide nanoparticles can be detected at quite low concentration and single-cell or single-particle detection has been reported.[110–112] Thus, iron oxide nanoparticles have recently been used to label cells and track their biodistribution and migration in vivo with MRI.[113–117] Recently, FeCo/single-graphitic-shell nanoparticles that are soluble and stable in aqueous solutions were reported.[118] The nanoparticles exhibit ultrahigh saturation magnetization and r1/r2 relaxivities. Preliminary in vivo experiments demonstrated long-lasting positive-contrast enhancement for vascular MRI in rabbits (Figure 5). These nanoparticles may have the potential for integrated diagnosis and therapeutic (photothermalablation) applications.

6.2. Molecular MRI of Integrin avb3 Expression Integrin avb3 is the most well-studied target for molecular MRI.[15, 119, 120] Antibody-coated paramagnetic liposomes (300–350 nm in diameter) containing Gd3 + ions were first reported for MRI of integrin avb3 expression.[121] In this study, molecular MRI of squamous cell carcinomas in a rabbit model was achieved by targeting paramagnetic liposomes to the angiogenic vasculature using LM609, a mouse anti-human integrin avb3 monoclonal antibody. Site-directed

contrast enhancement of angiogenic vessels in a rabbit corneal micropocket model has also been reported using antibody-coated Gd3 + –PFC nanoparticles (400–700 nm in diameter).[122] Peptidomimetic integrin avb3 antagonist was conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles for molecular MRI under a common clinical field strength of 1.5 T.[123, 124] In a Vx-2 ACHTUNGREsquamous cell carcinoma model, integrin avb3-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles increased the MR signal dramatically in the periphery of the tumor at 2 h post injection.[123] Despite the relatively large size ( % 270 nm in diameter), these nanoparticles penetrated into the leaky tumor neovasculature but did not migrate into the interstitium in appreciable amounts. In an atherosclerosis model, enhancement in MR signal was also observed among rabbits that received targeted nanoparticles.[124] In a later study, athymic nude mice bearing human melanoma tumors were successfully imaged using systemically injected avb3 integrin-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles.[125] Recently, integrin avb3-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles were reported for noninvasive assessment of angioACHTUNGREgenesis in early atherosclerosis, for site-specific delivery of an antiangiogenic drug (fumagillin, an antibiotic which can block blood vessel formation by binding to methionine aminopeptidase 2), and for quantitative follow-up of the therapeutic response (Figure 6).[126] Seven days after a single treatment with avb3-targeted nanoparticles with or without fumagillin, the targeted nanoparticles were readministered and decreased MR contrast enhancement was observed among the treated animals but not in control animals. Ex vivo histological analysis was also carried out to confirm the in vivo results. This study demonstrated the potential of combining molecular imaging and drug delivery with targeted nanoparticles to noninvasively define the atherosclerotic burden, to monitor the drug delivery, and to quantify local response to treatment.

6.3. Molecular MRI of Other Targets

Fibrin-targeted Gd3 + -containing nanoparticles were assessed in dogs under open-circulation conditions.[127] It was demonstrated that fibrin-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles can provide sensitive detection and localization of fibrin, which may allow for early identification of vulnerable plaques and lead to early therapeutic decisions.

mab-conjugated cross-linked iron oxide (CLIO) did not.[132, 133] Since both CLIO and MnMEIO were conjugated to trastuzumab to the same extent based on fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, the absence of tumor contrast enhancement for CLIO–trastuzumab was attributed to two main factors: the larger size of CLIO, which prevents efficient extravasation, and its lower magnetic property, which renders it not readily detectable by MRI at low concentration. Molecular MRI is still in its infancy. In many of the studies, ex vivo histology was not carried out to investigate/validate whether the targeted MR contrast agents are targeting the tumor vasculature, targeting the tumor cells, or accumulating nonspecifically in the interstitial space. It is likely that the feasible targets reachable by these ligand-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles will be mostly vasculature related, as the overall size of iron oxide nanoparticles with surface polymer coating and targeting ligands are usually quite large (> 20 nm in diameter). Newly developed nanoparticles with smaller sizes (preferably < 20 nm in diameter) and long circulation half life (at least a few hours) may allow for extravasation from the leaky tumor vasculature to a certain extent. Surface coating of these nanoparticles with small molecules or peptides should have better targeting efficacy than antibody-coated nanoparticles, because of the much higher number of targeting ligands and significantly smaller overall size. As the major disadvantage of MRI is its inherent low sensitivity, future development of novel contrast agents with the capability of targeting the cells in addition to the vasculature may dramatically increase the MR signal and facilitate the biomedical applications of molecular MRI.

7. Radionuclide-Based Imaging
(both are chemotherapeutic drugs for treating a wide range of cancers) were found to significantly increase the anti-proliferative effectiveness. Nanoparticles adherent to the VSMC were detected with high-resolution T1-weighted MRI at 4.7 T and 19F-MRS of the nanoparticle core also enabled quantitative and noninvasive dosimetry evaluation of targeted drug payloads. Latex nanoparticles of different sizes have been derivatized with tomato lectin (a very stable glycoprotein that effectively binds to blood vessels in rodents) and Gd3 + chelates for vasculature contrast enhancement in MRI.[129] A nanoparticle agent based on high-density lipoproteins (HDL) was used for the MR detection of atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.[130] A multifunctional nanoplatform that contains MRI and photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents inside, as well as targeting ligands on the surface, has been developed and exhibited improved MR contrast enhancement and PDT efficacy.[131] Through a process that involved systematic evaluation of the magnetic spin, size, and type of spinel metal ferrites, Mn-doped magnetism-engineered iron oxide (MnMEIO) conjugated with trastuzumab (an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) were recently shown to be able to visualize small HER2-positive tumors implanted in mice while trastuzusmall 2007, 3, No. 11, 1840 – 1854

Radionuclide-based imaging includes SPECT and PET, where internal radiation is administered through a low mass amount of pharmaceutical labeled with a radioisotope.[14] The major advantages of radionuclide-based molecular imaging are that they are very sensitive, quantitative, and there is no tissue penetration limit. The disadvantage is that the resolution (typically > 1 mm) of either SPECT or PET is not as high as the other imaging modalities. In most cases, the purpose of labeling the nanoparticle with a radionuclide was for the noninvasive evaluation of its pharmacokinetic properties with SPECT or PET.

7.1. Nanoplatform for SPECT Imaging The source of SPECT images are gamma-ray emissions.[134, 135] The radioisotope decays and emits gamma rays, which can be detected by a gamma camera to obtain 3D images. The first object that an emitted gamma photon encounters after exiting the body is the collimator, which allows it to travel only along certain directions to reach the detector, to ensure that the signal position on the detector accurately represents the source of the gamma ray. Because of the use of collimators to define the angle of incidence,

SPECT imaging has a very low detection efficiency (typically < 10À4 times the emitted number of gamma rays).[14] The pharmacokinetics, tumor uptake, and therapeutic efficacy of an 111In (t1/2 : 2.8 days)-labeled chimeric L6 (ChL6) monoclonal antibody-linked iron oxide nanoparticle was studied in athymic mice bearing human breast cancer HBT 3477 tumors.[136] 111In-labeled ChL6 was conjugated to carboxylated polyethylene glycol (PEG) on dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles ( % 20 nm in diameter), with one to two ChL6 antibodies per nanoparticle (Figure 7).

avb3-targeted nanoparticles was about four times higher than the non-targeted control. The spleen was found to be the primary clearance organ based on biodistribution studies. The major advantage of SPECT imaging over PET is that it can potentially allow for simultaneous imaging of multiple radionuclides, since the gamma rays emitted from different radioisotopes can be differentiated based on the energy.[139] However, no dual radioisotope imaging of radiolabeled nanoparticles has been reported and whether it can provide a significant advantage over single-isotope SPECT remains to be tested. Over the last decades, PET imaging has become more and more popular in both preclinical and clinical settings.

7.2. Nanoplatform for PET Imaging PET uses positron emitter-labeled molecules in very low mass amounts to image and measure the function of biological processes with minimal disturbance.[140, 141] The sensitivity of PET is significantly higher than SPECT since no collimator is used. With the development of microPET scanners dedicated to small-animal imaging studies (which can provide a similar in vivo imaging capability in mice, rats, and monkeys), one can readily transfer knowledge and molecular measurements between species, which can facilitate clinical translation of newly developed PET agents.[142, 143] To date, there have been very few reports on PET imaging of targeted nanoparticles. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) exhibit unique size, shape, and physical properties that make them promising candidates for biological applications.[3, 4] Liu et al. investigated the biodistribution of 64Cu (t1/2 : 12.7 h)labeled SWNTs in mice by PET, ex vivo biodistribution, and Raman spectroscopy (Figure 8).[144] It was found that these SWNTs are surprisingly stable in vivo and the surface PEG chain length can significantly affect the biodistribution and circulation half-life. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibit relatively long circulation half life (about 2 h) and low uptake by the RES. Efficient targeting of integrin avb3-positive tumors in mice was achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to cyclic RGD peptides. The Raman signatures of SWNTs were also used to directly probe the presence of SWNTs in mice tissues and confirm the radionuclide-based imaging results. After evaluating the pharmacokinetics and tumor-targeting efficacy, the use of SWNTs as a nanoplatform for integrated multimodality imaging and molecular therapy is currently in progress. Radionuclide-based imaging has much higher sensitivity than MRI and much better tissue penetration than optical imaging and ultrasound. The most important advantage of radionuclide-based imaging over other imaging modalities is the ability to quantitatively measure the radionuclide concentration in various organs over time, which can provide invaluable information about the pharmacokinetics and the full-body distribution of the radio-labeled nanoparticles. Different from other molecular imaging modalities where typically the nanoparticle itself is detected, radionuclidesmall 2007, 3, No. 11, 1840 – 1854

posed that the time this nanoparticle remained in the circulation was long enough to provide ample opportunity for it to exit the blood vessels and access the cancer cells. Inductively heating the nanoparticle with an externally applied alternating magnetic field (AMF) caused tumor necrosis at 24 h after AMF therapy. In a follow-up study, different doses of AMF were delivered at 72 h after nanoparticle injection.[137] SPECT imaging was carried out to quantify the nanoparticle uptake in the tumor, which was about 14 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 48 h post-injection. Delay in tumor growth occurred after AMF treatment and the difference was found to be statistically significant when compared with the untreated group. Integrin avb3-targeted 111In-labeled PFC nanoparticles were reported for the detection of tumor angiogenesis in New Zealand white rabbits implanted with Vx-2 tumors.[138] Nanoparticles bearing approximately 10 111In atoms per particle had better tumor-to-muscle ratio than those with only approximately one 111In atom per particle.

ers) in combination with efficient surface capping has been shown to substantially reduce desorption of core ions and render QDs more biologically inert for future applications.[155] Recently, nanotoxicology has emerged as a new branch of toxicology for studying the undesirable effects of nanoparticles.[165, 166] Development of novel nanoplatforms for biomedical applications must proceed in tandem with the assessment of any toxicological side effects. Many currently accepted techniques faced much skepticism during their initial development. For example, radionuclide-based imaging was severely doubted a few decades ago and it is now routinely used in the clinic. It is just a matter of time before nanoplatform-based methods, upon further development and improvement, will be accepted by the public for routine clinical use. The most promising applications of nanoplatform-based agents will be in cardiovascular medicine, where there are fewer biological barriers for the efficient delivery of nanoparticles, and in oncology, where the leaky tumor vasculature can allow for better tissue penetration than in normal organs/tissues. In many of the literature reports, it is not clear whether the nanoplatform-based imaging or therapeutic agents are actually targeting the vasculature or the (tumor) cells. It is likely that some nanoparticles do not extravasate at all or only extravasate to spaces in close proximity to the vessels, since most of the nanoparticles used so far are larger than 20 nm in diameter. Much care should be taken when interpreting the imaging data, target specificity, and targeting efficacy. Rigorous in vivo/ex vivo validation is needed before any nanoplatform-based agents enter the clinic. Nanoplatform-based ex vivo protein nanosensors and in vivo imaging are both critical for future optimization of patient management. Ex vivo diagnostics in combination with in vivo diagnostics can provide a synergistic approach that neither strategy alone can offer. Upon further development and validation, nanoplatform-based approaches (both ex vivo nanosensing and in vivo imaging) will eventually be able to predict which patients will likely respond to a specific molecular therapy and monitor their response to personalized therapy. With the capacity to provide enormous sensitivity, throughput, and flexibility, nanoplatforms have the potential to profoundly impact disease diagnosis and patient management in the near future.
