Chapter 37 In Situ Hybridization with Radiolabeled cRNA Probes, Using Tissue Sections and Smears
Carolin Adams, Qutayla A. Hamid, and Julia M. Polak
1. Introduction
Immunocytochemistry., together with biochemical procedures, has ensured rapid and accurate identification of tissue components. This has led to a better appreciation of cellular events, particularly storage and secretion of products. However, such techniques have certain drawbacks, in particular the impossibility of monitoring the intracellular processes concerned with protein synthesis. Thus, there was a need for a method that would provide more detailed information about the functional morphology and gene expression in tissues at cellular level. Advances in molecular biology allowed the development of in situ hybridization, a procedure that localizes specific nucleotide sequences (DNA or RNA) in tissue preparations using labeled complementary probes (DNA or RNA). 501

Initial in situ studies (1,2,3) involved the visualization of ribosomal DNA, using radiolabeled cRNA probes. Since then, the technique has expanded to include the hybridization of both DNA and cytoplasmic RNA with a variety of nucleic acid probes (4,5). For localization of RNA, there are four types of nucleic acid probes: double-stranded DNAprobes (5), single-stranded cDNA probes (6), cRNA probes (7), and finally, synthetic oligonucleotide probes (5). Doublestranded probes require “melting” and may reanneal during hybridizations, thus reducing the amount of probe available for reaction with the mRNA. The advantages of cRNA probes include the high thermal stability and affinity of RNA-RNA hybrids, a constant probe size, no vector sequences, and the availability of RNase to remove unhybridized probes (8). In addition, a probe with an identical sequence to the mRNA can be prepared and used as a sense probe. The probes can be labeled with radioactive or nonradioactive tags. The most successful of the nonradioactivemethods uses biotin-substituted nucleotides. However, at present, autoradiography appears to be the most sensitive detection method available for hybridization histochemistry. In the following pages, we will outline the method we follow using radioactive labeled riboprobes and give some examples of in situ hybridization for the investigation of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (9,10,11).

However, background increases with storage time. 8. Incorporation of radioactivity is estimated by determination of trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable counts.

acetic acid/alcohol, and 4% paraformaldehyde. Formalin and Bouin’s gave the best morphology but poor RNA retention, whereas glutaraldehyde fixation retained more RNA, but the resultant morphology was poor. Thus, we compromised with 4% paraformaldehyde, which gave the best results when considering both RNA retention and cellular morphology. 1. Tissues for hybridization must be collected as fresh as possible. Fix small pieces of tissue (1 x 1 x 0.5 cm) by immersion in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4OC(prolonged fixation reduces the hybridization signal). To avoid RNase contamination, wear gloves, use sterile equipment, and use DEPC treated water. 2. Transfer the tissue to phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% sucrose and store at 4°C (maximum 2 mo). 3. After washing the tissue, prepare cryostat blocks, cut sections (15 pm), thaw-mount on poly-L-lysine (PII,)-coated glass slides, and allow to dry at 37OCovernight before processing for hybridization. Use these slides as soon as possible; otherwise store in a container with desiccant at -7OOC. 1. 3.2.2. Culture Cultured cells can be grown on coverslips, slides, or in suspension. Rinse coverslips or slides, with attached cultures, in cold phosphatebuffered saline, and fix by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min at 4°C. Rinse several times in phosphate-buffered saline and finally in doubledistilled H20. Dry the cultures for 6 h at 37°C and store in a dessicated box at -70°C. Cell lines, grown in suspension, are cytospun onto poly-L-lysinecoated slides, which are then air-dried for 5-10 min before being fixed and stored as above.

Hybridization Drain the slides briefly (do not dry). Apply 20 PL of hybridization mixture preheated to 37OC, containing 2-3 ng radiolabeled cRNA probe (5 x lo5 cpm/section) diluted in hybridization buffer. Cover the sections with suitably sized dimethyl dichlorosilane-coated coverslips. Incubate at 37-43OC for 16 h. 3.3.3. Posthybridization Washing Remove the coverslips by immersion in 4 x standard sodium citrate (SSC). Wash the slides with 4 x SSC (37”C, 3 x 20 min) with gentle shaking. Remove unhybridized single-stranded cRNA probe by treating preparations with RNase A solution for 30 min at 37°C. Wash the slides with 2 x SSC (37OC, 30 min), with gentle shaking. Wash the slides with 0.1 x SSC (37OC,30 min), with gentle shaking. Dehydrate in 70,90, and 2 x 100% ethanol containing 0.3M ammonium acetate (10 min each at room temperature). Air dry (60-90 min). 3.3.4. Autoradiography Dip the slides in emulsion. Air dry for l-2 h. Store in light box for 2-5 d, depending on the radioisotopes used (2-3 d for 321?, d for =S>. 5 Develop in Kodak D19 developer prepared and used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fix as appropriate. Wash well with water.

509 3.3.5. Counterstaining

1. Preparations are usually lightly counterstained with hematoxylin or hematoxylin/eosin. However, eosin may cover fine grains. Other counterstains may be used where appropriate (e.g., Coomassie blue for myocytes, Toluidine blue for brain preparations). 2. Dehydrate, clear, and mount with DPX. Examples of in situ hybridization results are shown in Figs. 3-6.

4. Notes
1. Control experiments are very important to assess the specificity of the hybridization and should include the following: a. Sense probes: Probes identical to the coding strand of the mRNA under investigation are transcribed and hybridized as above. b. Ribonuclease treatment: Sections or cultures are treated with RNase A (20 pg/mL, 37OC, 30 min) before the prehybridization step. A remnant of the ribonuclease could result in probe degradation and thus invalidates the results. c. Inappropriate probe for the tissue in question. d. Inappropriate tissue for the probe in question. e. Northern Blot Analysis: The presence of the particular mRNA in the tissue may be confirmed by Northern Blot hybridization. f. Several probes, coding for different regions of the same gene. g. Immunocytochemistry: The correlation of immunocytochemistry results with thoseobtained by in situ hybridization is one of the most useful indications of the specificity of the signal. 2, Signal/ Background Ratio: Although probes labeled with % give better subcellular resolution than those labeled with 3?l?, there is an increase in background. The background may be reduced by the following manipulations: a. Decreased autoradiography time. b. Minimize the amount of probe used for hybridization. c. The inclusion of dithiothreitol(50 mM) in one or all the following: prehybridization solution, hybridization mixture or posthybridization washings. This is particularly true with the use of ?S-labeled probe. d. The addition of “cold” cytidine triphosphate to the prehybridization buffer.

3. In situ hybridization: a. Combined immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemistry may be done subsequent to in situ hybridization (a), the difference being the ommission of dextran sulfate from the hybridization buffer. After the final posthybridization wash, slides are processed as normal for immunocytochemistry. On completion of these protocols, they are dehydrated and dipped for autoradiography as described above. b. Quantitation of autoradiographic signal (12). Before attempting to quantify the autoradiographic preparations, one should take into consideration many factors that could affect hybridization signal such as the thickness of tissue or emulsion, loss of mRNA in tissue processing, and the efficiency of in situ procedure. Densitometry or computer imaging analysis give semi-quantitative estimates. 4. Transcription: A major problem when working with mRNA preparations is RNase contamination. Thus, gloves should be worn throughout the transcription and hybridization protocols. Glassware should be baked at 250°C for 4 h; batches of plasticware should be set aside exclusively for RNA work and autoclaved where appropriate before use. All solutions should be prepared with DEPC-treated water. DEPC (O.l%, final concentration) is added to distilled water and left at room temperature for 12 h. Residual DEPC is destroyed by autoclaving this water for 15 min. Solutions prepared for transcription with this water are then aliquoted into sterile tubes and stored at -20°C. Other labeled rNTPs can be used (10 mCi/mL, 400 Ci/mmol). This reaction can be run in the absence of unlabeled cytidine triphosphate. For a 20 PL reaction, 100 PCi of 400 Ci/mmol CX-~~P-CTPis 12 pm. However, the yield of full-length transcripts drops as the concentration of limiting nucleotide cytidine triphosphate falls below 12 l.t.m. The size of the probes may be reduced by alkaline hydrolysis (7). 5. Fixation: In animal experiments, perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde gives the best results: Anesthetize rats with ether and perfuse intracardially with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Remove the appropriate tissue and continue fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h as above. Human tissue could also be perfused, for example, perfusion of the bowel through mesenteric vessels and the brain through the Circle of Willis.
