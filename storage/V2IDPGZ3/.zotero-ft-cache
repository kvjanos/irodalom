[17] High‐Throughput Screening for Modulators of Stem Cell Differentiation
By PAUL J. BUSHWAY and MARK MERCOLA
Abstract

Realizing the potential of stem cell biology requires the modulation of self‐renewal and differentiation, both of which are incompletely understood. This chapter describes methods for the design, development, and implementation of cell‐based screens of small molecules, genes and expressed proteins for modulation of stem and progenitor cell fate. These include the engineering of embryonic and other stem cells with gene promoter–reporter protein constructs and their application in automated screening. We discuss considerations of promoter reporter selection, assay development and implementation, and image acquisition, analysis, and data handling. Such black‐box screens are useful for the identiﬁcation of probes of developmental processes and should provide tools that will identify druggable targets for biochemical assays.
Introduction

Stem cells combine the potential for self‐renewal with the ability to give rise to one or more differentiated cell types, and the ability to manipulate these cells offers unprecedented opportunities to increase our understanding of developmental biology and to provide a renewable source of cells to

address crippling degenerative diseases by replacing lost or damaged tissue. Recent advances have identiﬁed stem cells in nearly all tissue compartments of the body, and, increasingly, it is becoming possible to isolate the stem cells, maintain them in culture, and, in certain instances, expand their numbers. Despite advances in basic stem cell biology, it remains quite challenging to stimulate them to differentiate efﬁciently into the cell types needed for clinical application, either in culture or after transplantation into damaged tissue. The reasons for inefﬁcient differentiation include often extreme difﬁculty in obtaining large numbers of appropriate types of stem cells, poor survival in culture, and, upon transplantation, incomplete understanding of the natural molecules that promote differentiation. To promote efﬁcient differentiation requires speciﬁc knowledge of the molecules and signaling pathways that are relevant to the given type of stem cell. Moreover, in those instances in which multiple cell types develop from a single class of stem cell, the molecules and signaling pathways must also be matched to the lineage of the particular differentiated cell type that is desired. Thus, before the biotechnological and medical potential of stem cells can be realized, it will be essential to have in hand molecules that can inﬂuence their survival, renewal, and differentiation. The incomplete knowledge of natural modulators has prompted the development of cell‐based assays to screen chemical and genome libraries for small molecules, genes, and proteins capable of controlling stem and progenitor cell biology. This chapter focuses on the development of cell‐ based assays and considers the advantages of this approach, as well as the limitations that their current design imposes on the assay development and implementation process.
Assay Design

General Considerations of Cell‐Based Assay Technology Applied to Stem and Progenitor Cell Biology Cell‐based assays offer the ability to perform unbiased screens of libraries for molecules that modulate a wide range of biological phenomena (see other chapters in this volume). In the stem cell arena, screens have been implemented to identify small molecules that stimulate differentiation along multiple lineages (Ding et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004). The readouts of these assays can be based on detailed analysis of microscopic images collected, capable of detecting subcellular events, such as localization of a protein (high‐content screening, HCS) (e.g., Granas et al., 2005; Morelock et al., 2005; Starkuviene et al., 2004; Thomsen et al., 2005; Werner et al., 2006), which provides advantages over detection of a

particular cellular constituent using a plate reader‐based assay (conventional high‐throughput screening, HTS) because of the potential to reveal information about subcellular processes and detect relatively rare differentiation events against a background of nonresponding cells. This section focuses on the development of assays to measure the activity of individual marker gene promoters as a readout of differentiation because of their ubiquitous application in stem and developmental biology and because the fundamentals are the same as for detection of structural or biochemical features, which present more content. Analysis of the wells is often best achieved through image acquisition by automated microscopy because this method affords the most precise means of reporting data on the basis of the number of cells that are affected (e.g., differentiate into a target cell type). This is particularly important when relatively few cells in a well might be expected to be competent to respond to the inducer, such as when cells in the well are heterogeneous [as in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or primary cell material] or when the response is expected to vary stochastically by activity and the primary hit is modestly effective at the test dose or if toxicity or other confounding activities coexist. Detailed discussion of the HCS image analysis methods suitable for stem cell biology can be found in other chapters in this volume. Promoter–Reporter Constructs Some of the ﬁrst stem cell‐based screens were implemented using antibody binding to visualize differentiation (Ding et al., 2003), and this continues to be a common approach for cell‐based assays. Immunological detection of differentiation markers, however, has several obvious drawbacks for scale‐up, including cost and availability of immunological and detection reagents and incorporation of wash steps that increase the risk of cell detachment. The use of gene promoters to direct expression of reporter proteins is routine in developmental biology, and ﬂuorescent proteins, such as green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) and dsRED variants, offer a straightforward detection method (Hadjantonakis et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002). If expressed as a fusion protein to a localization domain, a transcription factor or membrane‐association domain for instance, the ﬂuorescent protein can be used in real time to detect regulated translocation to spatially constrained compartments within cells. Fluoresent proteins are also engineered into real‐ time biosensors of numerous cellular‐signaling processes, including detection of metabolites or protein–protein interactions indicative of ﬂux through a signaling pathway (e.g., see Miyawaki et al., 1997; Nalbant et al., 2004;

Tallini et al., 2006; Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002; reviewed in Tavare et al., 2001; Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). Alternatives to ﬂuorescent proteins include enzymes that catalyze production of a ﬂuorophore [e.g., ‐lactamase directed cleavage of LiveBLAzer ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate (Invitrogen)], although these systems traditionally have lacked the ability to visualize subcellular localization of reporter proteins. Alternative ﬂuorescent technologies that permit subcellular localization use covalent modiﬁcation of the reporter protein with a small ﬂuorescent probe, such as HaloTag (Promega). A potential pitfall of cell‐based, differentiation assays might be encountered when multiple steps in the differentiation program separate the readout (e.g., expression of a reporter protein at a particular stage of differentiation) from compound addition. Even a potently active compound might not be detected if culture conditions are not conducive to sustaining differentiation through successive steps until the readout is manifest. However, if a compound is active at a late stage of differentiation, the culture conditions might give rise to too few cells that are competent to respond. For these reasons, the readout of differentiation should follow compound addition as closely as possible, preferably within 24 to 48 h. This will also have the advantage of minimizing media changes with attendant reagent savings. Lentiviral Technology to Create Stable Reporter Lines Placing reporter proteins under the control of well‐characterized differentiation‐speciﬁc gene promoters requires that the transcriptional elements be located within a contiguous stretch of DNA suitable for introduction into cells. A number of relatively short, <10‐kb promoter fragments have been described as capable of directing transgene expression to stem, progenitor, or terminally differentiated cell types, including the genes Oct4 for embryonic stem cells (Yang et al., 2005), MHC (Subramaniam et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 2003) or MLC2V for cardiomyocytes (Yan et al., 2003), PDX‐1 for pancreatic tissue (Melloul et al., 2002), and insulin for pancreatic  cells (Odagiri et al., 1996). VSV‐G pseudotyped HIV lentiviral vectors are well suited for transducing promoter–reporter cassettes incorporating such fragments. VSV‐G pseudocoated vectors are generated by three plasmid (vector, packaging, and VSV‐G plasmids) calcium phosphate cotransfection of 293T cells, yielding serum‐free, viral supernatants with titers of 108 infectious viral particles/ml after concentration (as in Reiser, 2000) that can be stored at À80 . For infections, concentrated viral supernatant containing polybrene is added to stem cells, including murine or human ESCs, in suspension at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 to 100. The mixture is then plated as for routine culture.

Infection efﬁciency of ESCs under these conditions often exceeds 50%. The infection efﬁciency can be considerably higher for many other cell lines, but can be considerably lower for nondividing primary cells. Targeted Introduction of Reporters into Marker Gene Loci by Homologous Recombination The spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression that characterize many developmentally interesting genes require transcriptional elements that are distributed over large regions of DNA and thus these gene promoters exceed the carrying capacity of plasmid, HIV lentiviral, or common DNA viral transduction systems. Homologous recombination in transgenic mice is routinely used to integrate reporter cDNAs under the control of marker DNA loci. Because targeted recombination is performed in mouse ESCs, ESCs harboring ﬂuorescent proteins in reporter loci represent a potential source of cells for HCS and HTS. Homologous recombination in other cell types is more difﬁcult to achieve for a variety of reasons, such as poor transfection efﬁciency. An alternative is to target integration into reporter loci contained on bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes (BACs) or P1‐derived artiﬁcial chromosomes (PACs) because of their ability to contain large regions of genomic DNA and their stability. Commercially available libraries of BACs harboring upward of 150 kb of cargo DNA can be maintained and targeted by homologous recombination within Escherichia coli. Recombination‐mediated genetic engineering of BACs, known as recombineering, is a powerful method for fast and efﬁcient manipulation of large genomic regions for subsequent cell culture experiments. Protocols are available on the Recombineering Web site maintained by the NCI (http://www.recombineering. ncifcrf.gov). Recombineered BAC or PAC DNA is often prepared using a commercial kit (such as Qiagen) or using CsCl density sedimentation. Transfection into ESCs is often performed using a protocol involving lipid: DNA complex reagents (Bauchwitz and Costantini, 1998), but nonetheless is often inefﬁcient and requires optimization (Montigny et al., 2003). An efﬁcient method to overcome inefﬁcient transfection by retroﬁtting a drug selection cassette has been developed by Wang et al. (2001). Validation of Cell Lines To conﬁrm promoter–reporter ﬁdelity, engineered cell lines must be tested for correct expression of the reporter transgenes by colocalization of transgene expression with expression of the endogenous gene by in situ

hybridization or immunohistochemistry. In the case of ESCs, differentiation of certain derivatives can be achieved in differentiating aggregates of cells maintained generally in suspension, termed embryoid bodies (EBs), (Robertson, 1987). Within 3 to 4 days, 65% of the cells express brachyury, a mesendodermal marker, by FACS analysis (unpublished results), by which time EBs can be either maintained ﬂoating or plated onto gelatin‐coated cell culture plastic dishes or coverslips. In either case, beating cardiomyocytes arise by day 8. Because EBs are highly heterogeneous, immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization is essential to verify coincident reporter protein expression with the spatiotemporal pattern of endogenous gene expression. For lineages that form poorly in EBs, such as later stages of the endocrine pancreas, mouse ESC reporter lines can be evaluated rigorously in chimeric mouse embryos obtained by injection of murine ESCs into preimplantation blastocysts that are then introduced into the uterus of pseudopregnant females (Robertson, 1987). At appropriate stages, founder chimeric embryos should be examined for ESC contribution and marker expression in relevant tissues to verify that ﬂuorescent protein expression coincides with the spatiotemporal pattern of endogenous gene expression. The evaluation of reporter expression in human ESCs, for which the production of interspecies chimeras might be limited by poor contribution, as well as by law and material transfer agreements, verifying the ﬁdelity of reporter expression, presents considerable challenges and is an argument in favor of targeting reporter proteins to human gene promoters in BACs to maximize the likelihood of faithful expression.
Assay Development

Conﬁdence in the ability of an assay to resolve hits from background is based on its signal‐to‐noise ratio and the overall dynamic range. In the stem cell arena, it might be desirable to use cells that are not clonal and might even be primary cell isolates. The signal‐to‐noise ratios and dynamic range values in assays with these cells are likely to be more problematic than with established, clonal cell lines, resulting in an increased likelihood of false outcomes. In general, high‐throughput assays are considered robust if the coefﬁcient of variation is less than 10% across trials and the signal‐to‐noise ratio and dynamic range results in a Z0 value of >0.5. Z0 is calculated according to the following formula: Z0 ¼ 1 À ð3 Â sd½S0  þ 3 Â sd½Smax Þ=ABSðmean½Smax  À mean½S0 Þ;

where sd is standard deviation and S0 and Smax are values obtained for negative [S0] and positive (Smax) controls. An image‐based HCS assay might very well be amenable to screening at lower Z0 values [e.g., 0.3 (Granas et al., 2005)] for several reasons, not least of which is the ability to visually conﬁrm meaningful hits from image data. Evaluating an assay during development requires appropriate positive and negative controls. Physiologically relevant controls might not exist for a number of reasons, however, such as novelty of the assay for which no hit has yet been described. In such a case, it is imperative that the investigator optimize the assay using compounds or reagents that realistically approximate what would be expected from a scientiﬁcally interesting hit. Additionally, a pilot screening of about 10,000 compounds can be performed in the hope of blindly identifying an assay ‘‘hit’’ that can serve as a positive control. This is an undisciplined approach and is a risky and costly endeavor for a number of reasons.

time and cost. Stem cell assays that use promoter–reporter readouts are often evaluated using image analysis algorithms because the number of responding cells might be a minor fraction of the total number of cells in the well. This would be true if the cell population were heterogeneous, such as differentiating ESCs, for which a small number of responders might be a meaningful positive outcome because only a small fraction of the cells would be expected to be competent to differentiate along one particular lineage. In this context, applying an algorithm that measures the signal generated by a few cells against background nonresponders might lead to a poor Z0 value. Approaches that segment the images into single cells and evaluate the number of differentiating cells might circumvent this problem. Alternatively, a metric in which a given well is deemed ‘‘on’’ or ‘‘off’’ is determined relative to a threshold for activity could be imposed and validated statistically across many replicates. Such a strategy is worth using in a rapid and simple repeat of the primary screen when discrimination of hits by the primary screen is suboptimal.

Handling and Growth of Murine ESCs prior to Screening The typical bench‐top mESC differentiation assay calls for the growth on mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) on gelatin and subsequent differentiation within EBs. Each component is problematic in a high‐content screening approach. The use of poly‐D‐lysine‐coated tissue culture plastic was used to rapidly ﬁlter out MEFs during assay ramp‐up. MEFs adhere tightly to poly‐D‐lysine‐coated tissue culture plastic, whereas mESCs loosely tether to the surface. After 2 days in culture, the ESCs are then lifted from the culture dish with cold media, leaving MEFs behind. Two to three passages in this manner will typically clear the culture of all contaminating MEFs. A high level of residual MEFs reduces well‐to‐well reproducibility for several reasons, including that they might secrete factors that affect mESC differentiation. Choice of matrix material inﬂuences numerous assay parameters, including maintaining the cells in a spread, two‐dimensional environment more suitable for image analysis than EBs and the important consideration that certain matrix constituents will positively or negatively inﬂuence differentiation. Not surprisingly, evaluation of matrix components has been shown to optimize liver cell differentiation (Flaim et al., 2005). For mESC cardiogenesis assays, we found that a combination of poly‐D‐lysine and gelatin (see later) was best at promoting mESC survival and adherence, while maintaining differentiation potency, during the assay. In HC/HT formats it is not entirely unexpected to see deviations from the biology observed at the bench. One example of this was the longer assay development time observed when scaling the assay to a 384‐well format. Differentiation in EBs and in larger well plate formats typically results in cardiomyocyte differentiation by 8 days. This time line reproducibly shifted to 10 to 11 days when converting the assay to a 384‐well plate format. One possible explanation might be the change in cell number to media volume and alterations in media change procedure, which would alter the concentration of secreted factors that accumulate in conditioned medium. Imaging and Processing a Stem Cell Differentiation Assay Other chapters in this volume provide extensive discussion of the imaging processing of particular high‐content screening assays. The expenditure of effort up front to increase the ability of the algorithm to recognize features of the cells that reﬂect the desired biological response will return

FIG. 1. Comparison of a ‘‘strongly’’ positive focus as compared to a negative outcome in an ESC‐based cardiogenesis assay. Each panel consists of nine‐image, single‐well mosaics of images. Images were acquired at 460 nm (nuclear, not shown), 535 nm (speciﬁc channel, upper panels), and 620 nm (nonspeciﬁc channel, lower channels); emissions were gathered on the INCell 1000 with a 10Â objective and 4 Â 4 binning. The focus of eGFPþ cardiomyocytes in this case coincides with increased autoﬂuorescence, probably reﬂecting cell death in cells that had grown into a multilayered structure. From an imaging perspective, this dictates image capture of as much of the well as possible so as to maximize the likelihood of capturing a positive event. The appearance of a high‐intensity 535‐nm signal is localized to the lower right quadrant of the positive control well.

the investment by improving the hit identiﬁcation. This sections discusses a few points relevant to acquisition and processing of images for cell differentiation assays. The number of images acquired per well depends on the incidence of responding cells. Figure 1 demonstrates the appearance of a ‘‘strong’’ positive focus of differentiation as compared to a negative outcome in promoter–reporter ESC cardiogenesis assay in which relatively few cells are expected to respond to the inducing stimulus. Nine image single‐well mosaics of both 535‐nm (speciﬁc channel, eGFP) and 620‐nm (nonspeciﬁc channel, autoﬂuorescence) emissions were gathered on the GE INCell 1000 with a 10Â objective and 4 Â 4 binning. From an imaging perspective, this dictates image capture of as much of the well as possible so to maximize the likelihood of capturing a positive event. To achieve this end, one can capture many images with a higher power objective or fewer with a low‐power objective. The requirement for spatial resolution will ultimately drive the decision of objective and binning. Promoter–reporter assays that measure gene activity produce a simple yes/no response; thus, lower resolution is preferable due to speed and memory efﬁciency. In imaging a HC/HT screening campaign, processing speed, computational power, and memory constraints should be considered for overall process efﬁciency.

depth, with 4 Â 4 binning will approximate 170 kB in standard TIFF image format. Table I summarizes the approximate data load one might expect as image quality increases. Process time and storage requirement will increase proportionately. It will be essential to include operations on an image used to correct systemic problems due to the image capture process. Examples of image processing include correction of the illumination ﬁeld (commonly referred to as ﬂat‐ﬁeld correction), removal of corrupt pixels, noise suppression, and so on. The need for processing is exempliﬁed in Fig. 2, which shows the (x,y) pixel coordinate map with intensity on the z axis of a blank well from a 384‐well plate. Most of the variance is due to imperfections in the illuminating ﬁeld with occasional punctuate artifacts. Quantiﬁcation of the images involves the calculation of segmented pixels in an image (usually an area encompassing the region of interest) dictated by user preferences. The summed time of these two processes can rapidly saturate the computational power of even the most powerful workstations when dealing with large volumes of high‐resolution images. As shown earlier, from the perspective of cost effectiveness, it is preferable to use only the minimum resolution required to achieve the computational objective conﬁdently. However, it might be desirable to capture high‐ resolution images if archival for subsequent data mining for other purposes is anticipated. Using the example of the cardiomyocyte differentiation assay, three colors and nine ﬁelds were captured per well with a 10Â objective on the GE INCell1000 with 12‐bit images binned 4 Â 4. The data load of this process on a single 384‐well plate is approximately 3.7 GB. This is the lowest resolution that can be achieved on the INCell1000 as of February 2006. This resolution exceeds that which is necessary to resolve ‘‘positive’’ events deﬁned by promoter–reporter activity. Furthermore, simplicity in processing and quantiﬁcation is also desirable to enhance

efﬁciency. In the ESC‐based cardiogenesis assay, the emphasis was on calculation and summarizing events; in the assay described here, 1 well ¼ 1 sample ¼ 1 test. To process images rapidly in as simple a manner possible, an image mask was generated by calculating the global average of each image ﬁeld applying and accepting all pixels above this threshold plus an empirically deﬁned differential (percentage of global average). After application of a size exclusion ﬁlter, the result is the image processing scheme depicted in Fig. 3. Notes on Data Handling The success of a HC/HT screening assay depends on the handling of quantiﬁed data generated from the images. A general assumption can be made of a population of random samples; given enough samples, the population will

have a normal distribution. When zeros and extreme outliers are removed and the population is normalized across all well plates, one should expect a near‐normal distribution. In the mESC cardiomyocyte example, the desired result was to obtain a small number of hits that biased mESC lineage toward a cardiomyocyte outcome. In the primary screen, the majority of compounds would be expected to have little or no effect, with a small population of wells harboring artifactual ﬂuorescence due to ﬂuorescent compounds or toxicity. This can be summarized numerically in two categories: zeros (background level) and numbers of extraordinary scale relative to the population at large. Figure 4 depicts this graphically, with the intensity value of the wells on the x axis in quantiles and the frequency of observations on the y axis. Figure 4A shows that zeros are present in the population of data points at the greatest abundance, skewing the normality of the data population.

Illustrations were provided to describe the approaches taken to develop assays for stem cell differentiation. The major advantages of black‐box, cell‐based screens are that the compounds identiﬁed are selected based on biological function and can serve as powerful probes of basic mechanisms of cell phenomena, such as stem cell differentiation. A consideration with such screens is achieving sufﬁcient dynamic range and a signal‐to‐noise ratio with minimal plate‐to‐plate and day‐to‐day variation to discern hits. This can be achieved with judicious selection of promoter–reporter constructs and image analysis techniques. As data handling and storage capabilities and complementary algorithms for data mining improve, it will be practical to archive image data for subsequent analysis long after the initial screening campaign. We envision that this will enhance probe discovery in the future.
Appendix

As an illustration, a protocol is provided for an ESC cardiogenesis screen, which would need to be adapted to suit differentiation along alternate lineage or for other cell types, so is provided as an illustration. Growth of ESCs Cells are a murine embryonic stem cell line carrying the MHC promoter (REF) fused to a ﬂuorescent eGFP reporter (REF). Cells are recovered from a fresh thaw by coculture with MEFs and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)‐ enriched DMEM fortiﬁed with penicillin and strepfamycin, non‐essential amino acids (NEAA), Na‐pyruvate, ‐mercaptoethanol, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). On third passage cells are converted to poly‐D‐lysine‐ coated plates (0.01%; 300 kDa) and weaned to screening growth media with identical formulation of recovery media with the exception of 7% FCS. Cells are passaged twice prior to seeding 384‐ or 1536‐well plates. Cell Plating The 384‐ and 1536‐well plates are prepared with a matrix of poly‐D‐ lysine and gelatin at 0.005 and 0.05%, respectively. The matrix is left on the plates overnight at room temperature and removed and washed once with water. Residual water is aspirated from the plates, which are dried at 42 overnight. Seeding densities determined for 384‐ and 1536‐well plate formats are 750 to 1000 and 175 to 225 cells per well, respectively. Twofold shifts from these approximations can result in failure of the assay due to lack of

sufﬁcient cells or excessive spontaneous differentiation. Cells are resuspended in a half‐well volume of growth medium without LIF and applied to the plates and left to grow for 2 full days. Assay Execution On days 2 and 4, compound fortiﬁed medium is applied to the wells. In brief, the compound is prepared in CRG8 growth media at 2Â ﬁnal concentration and seeding volume equivalent added. Residual compound fortiﬁed media is then diluted twofold prior to second addition on day 4. Compounds are removed on day 6, and fresh growth medium is reapplied to cultures every other day. Ideally, each plate should contain positive and negative controls. Assay Termination On approximately day 10 (Æ 1 day) the assay is terminated by evacuation of media from wells and the addition of 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min. Plates are then washed twice in 1Â phosphate‐buffered saline(PBS) and then stained in 1 g/ml of 40 ,60 ‐diamidine‐20 ‐phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAP1) in 1Â PBS for 30 min. DAPI is removed from the wells with one wash of 1Â PBS and preserved in a solution of 50% glycerol and water. Quantiﬁcation Images gathered from the GE INCell 1000 are ﬂat‐ﬁeld corrected and quantiﬁed using an image subtraction technique utilizing the image global average and a global average based differential to remove the nonspeciﬁc 535‐nm ﬂuorescent signal. This process is executed using the GE software package Developer Toolbox v1.5 (formerly known as IRI). An image bit mask produced from the 535‐nm channel is passed through a size‐exclusion ﬁlter of approximately 3px and applied to both 535‐ and 620‐nm channels. Average and integrated densities in addition to area measurement are provided as output to data tables. Data Handling The data set is normalized across plates. We generally normalize using medians and application of simple linear scalers within each plate. A common alternative is to rely on control samples in each plate. Data are then power transformed according to the data set for visual statistical viewing of data. Data are binned and ﬁltered according to user criteria (rank, stdev, morphology, correlation across gathered excitations, frequency, etc.).
