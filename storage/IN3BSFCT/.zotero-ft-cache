[18] High‐Content Kinetic Calcium Imaging in Drug‐Sensitive and Drug‐Resistant Human Breast Cancer Cells
By MARIA A. DEBERNARDI and GARY BROOKER Department of Biology, Integrated Imaging Center Johns Hopkins University, Montgomery County Campus, Rockville, Maryland
Abstract

Intracellular calcium (Ca2þ)i is involved in the regulation of a variety of biological functions in cancer cells, including growth inhibition, tumor invasiveness, and drug resistance. To gain insight into the possible role played by Ca2þ in the development of drug resistance in breast cancer, we performed a comparative high‐content analysis of the intracellular Ca2þ dynamics in drug‐ sensitive human breast cancer MCF‐7 cells and ﬁve drug‐resistant, MCF‐7‐ derived clonal cell lines. Fura‐2 single cell ratiometric ﬂuorescence microscopy was used to monitor real‐time quantitative changes in cytosolic‐free Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]i) upon addition of phosphoinositol‐coupled receptor agonists. While the magnitude and the onset kinetics of the [Ca2þ]i rise were similar in drug‐sensitive and drug‐resistant cell lines, the decay kinetics of the [Ca2þ]i increase was found to be consistently slower in drug‐resistant than drug‐ sensitive cells. Such a delay in reestablishing homeostatic [Ca2þ]i persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2þ and was independent of the expression or function of speciﬁc drug efﬂux pumps associated with drug resistance. Moreover, intracellular Ca2þ pools releasable by phosphoinositol‐coupled receptor agonists or thapsigargin appeared to be differentially shared in drug‐sensitive and drug‐resistant cells. In light of the clinical relevance that drug resistance has in the treatment of cancer, the molecular and biochemical relationship between alterations in Ca2þ dynamics and drug resistance demands to be further investigated and tested in a wider array of cell types. Automated microscopy will help greatly in this pursuit by facilitating both sample imaging and data analysis, thus allowing high‐content as well as high‐throughput screening of large sample sets. A protocol for studying [Ca2þ]i kinetics with a commercially available automated imaging platform is described.

chemotherapy failure in breast cancer patients. In vitro, drug‐resistant (DR) bcc exhibit numerous differential biochemical features when compared to drug‐sensitive (DS) cells. These include overexpression of various membrane drug efﬂux pumps (e.g., P‐glycoprotein [P‐gp], multidrug resistance‐associated protein [MRP], and breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP], Barrand et al., 1997; Doyle et al., 1998), reduced susceptibility to apoptosis (Ogretmen and Safa, 1996), altered enzyme activity (Herman et al., 2006), and gene expression (Kudoh et al., 2000; Rahbar and Fenselau, 2005). Ca2þ is a ubiquitous intracellular molecule involved in the control of vital cellular processes and, thus, its spatial and temporal dynamics are ﬁnely controlled (Berridge et al., 2003). Little is known, however, about the potential role played by Ca2þ in breast cancer drug resistance. Higher resting intracellular Ca2þ levels ([Ca2þ]i) and deﬁcient intracellular Ca2þ pools have been described in two separate lines of human breast cancer MCF‐7 cells resistant to doxorubicin (Chen et al., 2002; Mestdagh et al., 1994). Interestingly, the epidermal growth factor receptor, whose activation leads to increased [Ca2þ]i, is overexpressed in adriamycin‐ resistant MCF‐7 cells but returns to the expression level exhibited by DS parental cells when chemosensitivity is restored (Dickstein et al., 1993). Finally, drug resistance can be reversed by compounds that, albeit through different mechanisms, modulate Ca2þ dynamics independently. Verapamil (VER, a well‐known voltage‐operated Ca2þ channel and Ca2þ inﬂux blocker) and cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of calcineurin, a Ca2þ calmodulin‐dependent protein phosphatase shown to potentiate Ca2þ responses; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2000; LoRusso et al., 1997) are widely studied chemosensitizers in tumors overexpressing P‐gp (Barrand et al., 1997; Hall et al., 1999; Twentyman et al., 1990). Probenecid (an organic anion transport blocker shown to either depress or increase Ca2þ responses; DiVirgilio et al., 1990; Packham et al., 1996) and genistein (a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor reported to prevent capacitative Ca2þ entry; Foster and Conigrave, 1999) are examples of compounds that modulate MRP pumps (Gollapudi et al., 1997; Versantvoort et al., 1993). This chapter describes a protocol to identify potential differences in Ca2þ dynamics between DS and DR bcc. We chose single‐cell ﬂuorescence microscopy‐based high‐content analysis (HCA) as a tool for our investigation. This technology offers signiﬁcant advantages over both ﬂuorimetric Ca2þ measurements and whole‐well, end‐point plate reader‐based high‐ throughput Ca2þ assays (e.g., FLIPR), as heterogeneous single‐cell responses can be appreciated, real‐time Ca2þ kinetics (rather than just the peak response) and spatially localized Ca2þ signals can be evaluated, and simultaneous analysis of other biological responses can be performed (DeBernardi and Brooker, 1996).

allows the processing of high volumes of samples, thus moving HCA into a higher throughput mode (high‐content screening, HCS). Here, we describe in detail a procedure for HCA of Ca2þ kinetics in DS and DR bcc and provide a protocol to apply this HCA to a commercially available, automated imaging station for HCS purposes.
High‐Content Analysis of Ca2þ Dynamics by Fluorescence Microscopy

Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines Three different wild‐type MCF‐7 cell lines (wt, DS bcc) are tested and are from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), the Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University (GU), Washington, DC, and Dr. Susan Bates, NCI, NIH (Bethesda, MD). Five drug‐resistant MCF‐7‐derived cell lines are used: MCF‐7/ADR cells [resistant to adriamycin (Vickers et al., 1988) and overexpressing P‐gp (Fairchild et al., 1987)]; MCF‐7/VP cells (resistant to VP‐16 etoposide and overexpressing MRP; Schneider et al., 1994); MCF‐7/C4 (resistant to camptothecin and not overexpressing P‐gp or MRP; Fujimori et al., 1996); MCF‐7/Melph cells (resistant to melphalan and expressing neither P‐gp nor MRP; Moscow et al., 1993); and MCF‐7/Ad‐Vp cells [resistant to adriamycin and VER and expressing BCRP (Doyle et al., 1998) but not P‐gp or MRP (Lee et al., 1997)]. Cells are grown at 37 in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2, refed twice a week, and passaged once a week (not to exceed 80% conﬂuence). DR cells are grown in the presence of the appropriate drug (in M) : MCF‐7/ ADR–doxorubicin, 2; MCF‐7/VP–VP‐16 etoposide, 4; MCF‐7/Melph–melphalan, 6; MCF‐7/Ad‐Vp 3000–doxorubicin, 5; and VER, 10. Pairs of DS and DR clones are plated and imaged the same day; we compared MCF‐7/ ADR and MCF‐7/Ad‐Vp cells with their parental DS lines from GU and NIH, respectively, and the other DR clones with MCF‐7 cells from ATCC. Media and Reagents 1. IMEM medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L‐glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 50 g/ml gentamycin. Used for all cell lines except MCF‐7/C4. 2. RPMI‐1640 with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L‐glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 50 g/ml gentamycin. Used only for MCF‐7/C4 cells. 3. H/H buffer (Ham’s F‐10 medium supplemented with 20 mM Na‐ HEPES, pH 7.4)

[18]

4. Fura 2‐AM (1 mM stock in anhydrous DMSO; store at –20 ) 5. Fura‐2 standards: 5 M Fura‐2 pentaK (10 mM stock in H2O) in 10 mM Na‐HEPES, pH 7.4, with either 1 mM CaCl2 (‘‘high’’ standard) or 1 mM EGTA tetrasodium salt (‘‘low’’ standard). Ca2þ Imaging [Ca2þ]i is measured by Fura‐2 ﬂuorescence ratio imaging. Fura‐2 is a dual‐excitation, single‐emission Ca2þ indicator that, by virtue of its ratiometric properties, allows quantitative Ca2þ measurements that are independent of artifacts such as uneven cell loading and intracellular dye distribution, wavelength and intensity of the excitation light, dye leakage, and photobleaching. Cell Growth and Labeling 1. Plate cells (20,000 cell/ml) on 25‐mm‐round, thickness No.1 glass coverslips (Fisher Scientiﬁc) in six‐well plates and grow for 48 to 72 h (60 to 70% conﬂuence). To avoid artifacts in [Ca2þ]i measurements, grow DR cells in drug‐free medium during this time. 2. Label cells with 5 M Fura‐2 AM (1 ml/well) in growth medium (45 min/37 ). 3. Wash cells twice with H/H buffer (1 ml/well) and let sit for 15 min at room temperature to allow complete dye deesteriﬁcation. 4. Transfer coverslips to stainless‐steel chambers (Attoﬂuor Coverlips Holder, Molecular Probes), ﬁtting the microscope stage holder (H/H buffer volume ¼ 950 l/chamber). 5. Manually add compounds (20Â in H/H buffer) to the chambers in 50‐l volumes to ensure fast diffusion over the cells being imaged. Fluorescence Microscopy Cells are imaged at room temperature using an Attoﬂuor RatioVision ﬂuorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope, a F‐Fluar 40Â, 1.3 NA, oil‐immersion objective, and an ICCD camera (high gain used for MCF‐7/ ADR and Ad/Vp cells). Fura‐2 dual excitation ratio imaging is performed with emission at >510 nm and excitation at 340 nm (maximal signal with high [Ca2þ]i) and 380 nm (maximal signal with low [Ca2þ]i); the 340/380‐nm excitation ratio increases as a function of the [Ca2þ]i. Accurate day‐to‐ day comparison of [Ca2þ]i is ensured by calibrating the instrument daily. A two‐point calibration is done in vitro using 5 M Fura‐2 pentaK

standards (‘‘high’’ standard: maximal emission at 340 nm; ‘‘low’’ standard: maximal emission at 380 nm). Ratio values are converted by the software to [Ca2þ]i nM according to the equation described by Grynkiewicz et al. (1985), with a Kd of 225 nM. Data Capture and Statistical Analysis To identify single cells, regions of interests (ROIs) are placed manually and [Ca2þ]i is recorded over time (2‐s interval) from each ROI. Thirty to 99 cells per microscopic ﬁeld/coverslip are imaged simultaneously. Single‐cell responses can be averaged to yield [Ca2þ]i population means (Æ SEM) and plotted against time. Statistical analyses use the two‐tailed, unpaired t test with a 95% conﬁdence interval for differences between means (StatMate, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Ca2þ Elevating Agents The status of the intracellular Ca2þ pool and Ca2þ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are studied by either activating ER inositol 1,4,5‐ trisphosphate (IP3) receptors [ATP and UTP (50 M), bradykinin (BK, 10 M), ‐thrombin (THR, 5 M) are phosphoinositol (PI)‐coupled receptor agonists, which activate IP3 receptors and Ca2þ release] or bypassing the PI pathway using thapsigargin (TG, 1 M), which poisons ER Ca2þ‐ATPase pumps, thus preventing the reuptake into the stores of Ca2þ passively diffused out into the cytosol (Tharstrup et al., 1990). Measurement of Resting Ca2þ State and Stimulated [Ca2þ]i Response Resting [Ca2þ]i is recorded for $60 s before agonist addition and ranges between 40 and 70 nM with no statistically signiﬁcant differences detected among the three DS MCF‐7 cell lines and between DS and DR cells, although DR cells exhibit a wider range of variability (data not shown). MCF‐7/ADR and MCF‐7/Ad‐Vp cells show a lower ﬂuorescence signal than the other cell lines, likely reﬂecting a high degree of dye extrusion by the drug efﬂux pumps (Homolya et al., 1993); however, pump inhibitors are not used during dye loading to avoid affecting the native Ca2þ responses of the cells. The number of cells responsive to a given agonist varies among all the cell lines with <30% of the cells (both DS and DR) responding to THR and BK, whereas >95% of the cells (both DS and DR) consistently respond to ATP and UTP (Dixon et al., 1997). Onset kinetics are comparable among all the DS and DR cell lines and rather fast [average onset t1/2 (time to reach 50% of the [Ca2þ]i peak) is $10 s, Fig. 1]. The magnitude of the

response (fold increase ¼ peak [Ca2þ]i /basal [Ca2þ]i varies among DS and DR cells depending on the agonist (Table I). All three MCF‐7 wt cell lines respond to any given agonist with similar magnitude and, thus, data shown represent pooled responses. With selected agonists, quantitative differences in peak [Ca2þ]i are observed between DS and DR cells, which, however, are found not to be statistically signiﬁcant (Table I). MCF‐7/ADR cells pretreated with VER (25 M, 2 h) show a signiﬁcantly enhanced dye loading and magnitude of the ATP‐evoked Ca2þ (fold increase: MCF‐7/ADR no VER: 1.5 Æ 0.2, n ¼ 5; with VER: 3.9 Æ 0.7, n ¼ 9, P < 0.05).

All cell lines responded to TG when applied as the ﬁrst drug, with a comparable $3‐fold [Ca2þ]i increase (Table I). As expected from the mode of action of TG, onset Ca2þ kinetics (t1/2 $40 s) are slower than those evoked by PI‐coupled receptor agonists but are similar in DS and DR bcc. Interestingly, in four DR clones, but not in MCF‐7 wt or MCF‐7/Vp cells (the only DR clone with receptor‐mediated [Ca2þ]i decay similar to wt cells), TG increased [Ca2þ]i when applied after ATP (Fig 1). Also, selected DR clones are able to respond to ATP after TG induced a robust [Ca2þ]i increase (authors’ personal communication). Thus, the DS and DR bcc under study exhibit similar Ca2þ homeostatic levels and comparably ﬁlled IP3‐ and TG‐sensitive intracellular stores that release Ca2þ (via active IP3 release or constitutive leakage) with seemingly equal efﬁciency and kinetics. However, TG‐ and IP3‐releasable pools seem to be shared differentially in DS and DR bcc and differential sensitivity to TG of the ER Ca2þ‐ATPase pumps may exist. Decay Kinetics of Agonist‐Stimulated [Ca2þ]i Response The decay kinetics of [Ca2þ]i increased by all PI‐coupled receptor agonists are markedly slower in four out of ﬁve DR MCF‐7 clones than in DS bcc (Figs. 1 and 2). Also, single‐cell HCA of Ca2þ kinetics revealed greater variation in cell behavior among DR than DS cells, as reﬂected by larger data error bars (Fig. 1). To quantify Ca2þ decay, we used the [Ca2þ]i decay t1/2, calculated as the time (seconds) at which [Ca2þ]i reaches 50% of the peak during the decay phase, minus the time at which the [Ca2þ]i peak is achieved. Compared to DS cells, (1) MCF‐7/ADR and MCF‐7/Ad‐Vp cells showed the longest decay t1/2, (2) MCF‐7/C4 and MCF‐7/Melph cells exhibited a decay t1/2 about twice as long, and (3) MCF‐7/VP cells showed a decay t1/2, which, for all the agonists tested, was consistently, although not signiﬁcantly, longer (Figs. 1 and 2). Importantly, even a 24‐h treatment with VER (25 M) did not accelerate ATP‐evoked Ca2þ decay t1/2 in MCF‐7/ADR (MCF‐7 wt: 46 Æ 6.3 s, n ¼ 9; MCF‐7/ADR: 132 Æ 20 s, n ¼ 9; P ¼ 0.0008). Chelation of extracellular Ca2þ by EGTA did not signiﬁcantly affect the magnitude of ATP responses (indicating that the primary cause for the [Ca2þ]i increase is ion mobilization from internal stores) but accelerated the [Ca2þ]i decay in both DS and DR cells; nevertheless, decay kinetics in DR cells remained signiﬁcantly longer than DS cells (data not shown). In both DS and DR bcc, [Ca2þ]i increased by TG was slower to return to baseline than the receptor‐mediated [Ca2þ]i rise. In particular, two DR clones (Ad‐Vp and VP cells) showed a signiﬁcantly slower recovery than DS cells (authors’ personal communication).

Conclusions from HCA and Rationale for High‐Content Screening

Single‐cell, real‐time HCA of intracellular Ca2þ dynamics identiﬁed slower [Ca2þ]i decay kinetics in DR bcc when compared to DS bcc. This phenomenon does not correlate with the functional expression of known drug efﬂux pumps, occurs after IP3‐dependent and ‐independent Ca2þ increase, and thus localizes downstream from speciﬁc Ca2þ‐signaling pathways, suggesting that DR bcc are impaired in their ability to readily remove Ca2þ accumulated in the cytosol and restore Ca2þ homeostasis. Ca2þ transients (‘‘on’’ reaction) are biphasic, consisting of a rapid‐onset phase (release from intracellular stores) and a slower compensatory inﬂux (capacitative entry; Berridge et al., 2003) that ampliﬁes the initial Ca2þ signal and replenishes the stores. A recovery phase (‘‘off ‘‘reaction) then follows when cells rectify the increased [Ca2þ]i via Ca2þ binding to cytoplasmic proteins (both buffer and effector proteins), Ca2þ efﬂux (through

326

[18]

plasmalemmal Ca2þ‐ATPase pumps and NaþCa2þ exchangers), and Ca2þ sequestration into the stores (through ER Ca2þ‐ATPase pumps and mitochondrial Ca2þ transporters). Thus, any of these ‘‘off’’ mechanisms could be impaired in the DR bcc tested in this study. While sporadic reports imply a potential association between some of these mechanisms and drug resistance in cancer (e.g., McAlroy et al., 1999; Padar et al., 2004; Villa and Doglia, 2004; Zhou et al., 2006), no systematic studies are available where DS and DR bcc are interrogated for possibly causal links between any of these mechanisms and drug resistance. In view of the clinical relevance that drug resistance has in breast cancer therapy, further investigations are needed to (1) identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the slower decay, (2) study the speciﬁcity and occurrence of anomalous Ca2þ dynamics in a wider array of DR cancer cells, and (3) establish a potential relationship (cause/effect) between Ca2þ and drug resistance. Such studies call for higher cell imaging and data analysis throughput than HCA can provide. HCS of Ca2þ dynamics and automated microscopy will make these studies feasible.
High‐Content Screening

In our laboratory, automated ﬂuorescence microscopy is performed on a BD Pathway Bioimager (BD Bioscience, Rockville, MD), which displays advantageous features that facilitate the HCS studies we propose as well as other HCA kinetic and end point applications (Chan et al., 2005; DeBernardi et al., 2006). Relevant to our project, this system uses mercury arc lamps as light sources, which, combined with 340‐ to 380‐nm excitation ﬁlters and a UV transmission‐optimized 20Â objective, 0.75 NA, provide optimal excitation for Fura‐2 and, compared to laser‐based systems, minimizes photobleaching and phototoxicity greatly (a major concern when imaging live cells). A high‐sensitivity CCD camera, with adjustable gain, affords detection of suboptimal emission signals (such as those exhibited by DR bcc overexpressing drug efﬂux pumps). The imaging station has environmental control (5% CO2 and 37 ensure physiological conditions for live cells) and an on‐stage ﬂuidic head (with disposable tips) for automated compound addition compatible with 96‐well plates (high‐density plates provide high sample throughput). Because the stage is stationary and the objective moves underneath the 96‐well plate, imaging takes place while compounds are added and, thus, changes in early‐onset Ca2þ kinetics can be detected. The software (AttoVision) performs an automated autofocus routine, segmentation [single cells are identiﬁed as ROIs (virtually unlimited number)], image capture, drug addition, ratio calculations, and real‐ time data display. To increase sample throughput, multiple wells within a

[18]

96‐well plate can be interleaved and processed at the same time [the x–y mechanical resolution (100 nm) allows the objective to reposition accurately on previously imaged ﬁelds] with user‐settable time spacing between imaging and ﬂuidic steps. Further improvement in throughput can be achieved by performing cell segmentation and data analysis off‐line (Reanalysis Option), after the entire plate is processed. To perform HCS on bcc, we are in the process of adapting our HCA Ca2þ kinetics on the Pathway. Here we describe the modiﬁcations to the HCA protocol, the advantages offered by the automated data analysis, and provide sample data obtained with rat C6 glioma cells, which we use routinely for Ca2þ kinetics studies. Cell Plating, Labeling, and Imaging Setup 1. Plate cells in 96‐well plastic plates (Greiner Bio‐one, Clear black wall plates) at a density of 5000 to 10,000 cell/well (100 l/well) and grow cells 24 to 48 h prior to imaging. 2. Label cells as described for HCA (loading: 60 l/well dye solution; washing: 100 l/well H/H buffer; imaging: 80 l/well H/H buffer). 3. Prepare compounds (5Â in H/H buffer) and place in speciﬁc wells of a 96‐well conical‐bottom, polypropylene plate; automated delivery of 20 l/well volumes at a rate of 40 l/s ensures even diffusion over the cells with no need for mechanical mixing. 4. To calibrate the instrument, place the two Ca2þ standards (100 l/ well) in adjacent wells of a Greiner plate. Open the Dye Setup dialog box (Calibration Tab) and capture >510‐nm emissions after excitation at 340 (numerator) or 380 (denominator) nm of the high or low standards, respectively, and set exposure times to yield maximal signal with either standard (usually, denominator exposure time is twice that of the numerator); the software uses the captured ratio and intensity values to generate a calibration curve and interpolate ratio values into [Ca2þ]i (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985). 5. Set up and save a Fura‐2 Ca2þ ratio‐imaging ‘‘template macro’’ and apply it to all the wells to be processed—‘‘compound macro’’; this macro is indeed an automated assay protocol listing all the various steps to be performed in each well.  Autofocus setup course and ﬁne; deﬁne the best algorithm (e.g., Vollath F4), the maximal z span that the objective must travel above/ below starting z position, and the optimal z interval to ensure that focus on the cells is attained. Test at least a couple of wells on each side of the 96‐well plate to determine best settings. These parameters are plate and cell type speciﬁc.

Screen shot from the Pathway Bioimager showing Ca2þ changes over time (seconds) in Fura‐2‐labeled C6 cells exposed to ATPs (50 M) ﬁrst and then to the Ca2þ ionophore, ionomycin (1 M). The upper graph shows color‐coded, single‐cell Ca2þ responses (one trace ¼ one cell; 106 cells being imaged) and the lower graph shows emission signals after 340‐nm (green traces) and 380‐nm (red traces) excitation. On the left side of the graphs, a pseudo‐colored 340/380‐ nm ratio image of the cells highlights heterogeneity in the ATP responses (ratiometric color model scale for [Ca2þ]i level: purple/ blue ¼ low; green/yellow ¼ high). Overlaid on this image is a screen shot capture of the Macro Setup dialog box showing the automated steps carried out in each well of the plate. The two panels on the right side of the graphs depict the automated segmentation process: using the dual channel exclude center option, single cells are identiﬁed as ROIs, numbered, and a segmentation mask is generated where the colors assigned to individual ROIs match those of the corresponding Ca2þ traces in the graph.

 Auto‐ROI setup: use the dual channel/exclude center shape (which places ROIs on the cytoplasm excluding the nucleus) to segment single cells; reject dead or unhealthy cells by size (limiting object pixel min/max) and/or brightness (lowering upper threshold intensity). Use shading and watershed options to correct for uneven ﬁeld illumination and improve segmentation if cells are too clustered.  Imaging setting: in light path setup, deﬁne ﬁlter conﬁguration: numerator A lamp ¼ 340 and denominator B lamp ¼ 380/ND, epiﬂuorescence dichroic ¼ 400DCLP, emission ﬁlter ¼ 435 nm LP; in dye setup, deﬁne the exposure time (seconds) and camera gain for both 340‐ and 380‐nm excitation (note that if working in calibrated mode, these parameters are set during the calibration procedure and cannot be changed for the calibration to remain valid) as well as the numerator and denominator threshold for ratio capture; in probe cycle, deﬁne sampling frequency (2 s) and duration of kinetic imaging (baseline and after compound addition).  Fluid handling setup (prepare and dispense steps), deﬁne the volume (20 l), rate of delivery (40 l/s), origin, and destination well of each compound to be added to the cells. 6. Set up a treatment plate map indicating the agonist (and its concentration) added to each well to be processed and associate it with the macro. Assign the macro to the assay launch box. For daily use, launch the macro from here and adjust parameters such as exposure times, camera gain, and ROI settings to compensate (if necessary) for variation in cell labeling, morphology, and density. Create new treatment plate maps as needed.

Single cell kinetic responses from each ROI are analyzed on the ﬂy (unless a reanalysis mode is chosen) and displayed in graphs showing changes over time in both the emission signals (after 340 and 380 nm excitation) and the 340/380‐nm ratio (or [Ca2þ]i, nM in calibrated mode). 2. Numbered ROIs in the images and their corresponding ratio traces in the graph are color coded and interactive; thus, ‘‘clicking’’ on a trace highlights the cell of origin and vice versa, allowing the identiﬁcation of individual cell responses within a heterogeneous population (Fig. 3). 3. As the wells are processed, corresponding average traces are plotted on the plate map for immediate visualization. Each well is assigned an ADF ﬁle (proprietary binary format) containing measured numeric data (kinetic data points) and images saved during the experiment (TIFF ﬁles). Also, an experiment summary (text ﬁle) is generated that contains

Screen shot from the Pathway Bioimager showing the ROI classiﬁcation process, based on the ATP‐increased Ca2þ rate‐of‐fall data attribute, applied to the experiment displayed in Fig. 3 (for clarity purpose, only six representative cell traces are shown). The data classiﬁcation setup dialog box shows the treatment zone range (corresponding to the area between the two hatched regions on the graph) and the rate‐of‐fall setting. Ca2þ traces with decay slower than the preset value are classiﬁed as slow (red), whereas traces with faster decay are classiﬁed as fast (blue). An ROI Summary.txt ﬁle is generated with single cell rate‐of‐fall values. These values (negative integers) can then be transformed within Microsoft Excel or BD Image Data Explorer into positive integers and plotted.

FIG. 5. HCS Ca2þ decay well data analysis and report. Data classiﬁcation based on ATP‐increased Ca2þ rate of fall is applied to a plate (three representative wells, B 2, 3, and 4 are shown). (Left) A Report.txt ﬁle is generated within AttoVision summarizing both ROI (percentage of positive and negative cells in each well) and well classiﬁcation data (wells are considered positive and color coded in yellow if more than 30% of the ROIs exhibit a decay slower than the preset value; negative wells are displayed in gray). (Right) ROI summary and treatment plate map ﬁles are imported into the IDE program, which generates a plate report listing the average Æ SD and SEM of the rate‐of‐fall values in each well analyzed and a plate heat map (B2, negative, fast decay ¼ black; B3–4, positive, slower decay ¼ yellow).

relevant assay parameter information about each experiment and can be used for documentation and data storage/mining. 4. Experimental data are binned into user‐deﬁned classes by using a hierarchical data classiﬁcation structure wherein ROIs and wells are classiﬁed as positive or negative (and color coded accordingly) based on speciﬁc data attributes (amplitude [max/min/average], rate‐of‐rise [onset, slope of ﬂuorescence intensity increase over time] or, as in our case, rate‐of‐ fall [decay, slope of ﬂuorescence intensity decrease over time]) over the entire data range or within speciﬁc treatment zones (TZ1,2,3,n) (e.g., start to ﬁrst compound addition [baseline], from compound addition to peak response, or, as in our case, from peak response back to baseline]). A preset data classiﬁcation can be associated with the kinetic macro prior to running the experiment and all the ROIs and wells are then classiﬁed (and color coded accordingly) on the ﬂy (Fig. 4). 5. For each experiment, an ROI summary (with single cell kinetic data and classiﬁcation parameters) and a plate report (with percentage positive/ negative wells) are automatically generated as text ﬁles and can be imported into traditional spreadsheet or graphing programs. 6. In our HCS, the ROI summary and treatment plate map ﬁles are imported into BD Image Data Explorer (IDE), a Microsoft Excel‐based program that performs single cell‐based data analysis and generates reports and charts (e.g., dose–response curves; EC50, Z0 and S/N calculations; histograms, scatter plots). Within IDE, new arithmetic parameters are created to, for example, normalize raw amplitude values (by diving peak ratio/basal ratio or peak [Ca2þ]i /basal [Ca2þ]i) and transform rate‐of‐fall raw values (negative integers) into positive integers (more convenient to analyze and plot). Wells positive for the desired data attribute (in our case, a Ca2þ rate of fall less than a preset threshold value from drug‐sensitive cells) are visually identiﬁable in a heat map, a pseudo‐colored overview of the plate where both scale and color are user adjustable. 7. The ﬁnal IDE report will show the rate‐of‐fall values (or the values of any chosen data attribute) per well (ROI average ÆSD and SEM); user‐ generated graphs can be saved with this report, printed, and entered into hard‐copy, record‐keeping books (Fig. 5).

Abstract

High‐content imaging platforms capable of studying kinetic responses at a single‐cell level have elevated kinetic recording techniques from labor‐ intensive low‐throughput experiments to potential high‐throughput screening assays. We have applied this technology to the investigation of heterogeneous cell cultures derived from primary neural tissue. The neuronal cultures mature into a coupled network and display spontaneous oscillations in intracellular calcium, which can be modiﬁed by the addition of pharmacological agents. We have developed algorithms to perform Fourier analysis and quantify both the degree of synchronization and the effects of modulators on the oscillations. Functional and phenotypic experiments can be combined using this approach. We have used post‐hoc immunolabeling to identify subpopulations of cells in cocultures and to dissect the calcium responses of these cells from the population response. The combination of these techniques represents a powerful tool for drug discovery.

Introduction

High‐content screening has become established as a valuable tool for drug discovery, allowing rapid quantiﬁcation of end point parameters such as neurite outgrowth (Simpson et al., 2001), cell motility (Richards et al., 2004), and intracellular translocations (Ding et al., 1998) that were previously not amenable to high‐throughput screening. While these ﬁxed end
