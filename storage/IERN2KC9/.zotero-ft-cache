SUMMARY

Inactivation of cell death is a major step in tumor development, and p53, a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer, is a critical mediator of cell death. While a role for p53 in apoptosis is well established, direct links to other pathways controlling cell death are unknown. Here we describe DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a p53 target gene encoding a lysosomal protein that induces macroautophagy, as an effector of p53-mediated death. We show that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM-dependent manner and, while overexpression of DRAM alone causes minimal cell death, DRAM is essential for p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of DRAM in primary tumors revealed frequent decreased expression often accompanied by retention of wildtype p53. Collectively therefore, these studies not only report a stress-induced regulator of autophagy but also highlight the relationship of DRAM and autophagy to p53 function and damage-induced programmed cell death.

INTRODUCTION Inactivation of cell-death pathways is a central component of cancer progression (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). Various mechanisms exist in normal human cells to invoke cell death and eradicate damaged cells that may otherwise multiply and form a tumor (Crighton and Ryan, 2004). Consequently a number of known death regulators are mutated or lost in cancer. In particular, the p53 tumor suppressor, a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death, is mutated in approximately 50% of all tumors (Beroud and Soussi, 2003).

The induction of cell death by p53 occurs via both target gene activation and transactivation-independent mechanisms at mitochondria (Moll and Zaika, 2001). In response to various forms of cellular stress, the levels of p53 increase and, after rapid localization of a proportion of p53 to mitochondria (Erster et al., 2004), p53 accumulates in the nucleus where it transactivates a number of proapoptotic target genes (Crighton and Ryan, 2004). Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved, orchestrated cell-death process characterized by membrane-blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of distinct apoptotic bodies that contain components of the dead cell (Edinger and Thompson, 2004). This process occurs without membrane breakdown and does not elicit an inﬂammatory response, with apoptotic bodies being eventually removed by phagocytic cells. Central to this apoptotic process are a group of cysteine aspartyl proteases or caspases, which effect the destruction of the cell in an orderly fashion. Autophagy (strictly the form termed macroautophagy, but hereafter for simplicity referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved membrane-trafﬁcking process that operates at basal levels under normal conditions as a means of degrading cytosolic proteins and organelles. Cytosol and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum are engulfed into double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes (induction step). Fusion subsequently occurs between the autophagosomes and lysosomes to form autolysosomes in which the cargo of the autophagosome is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (turnover step) (Baehrecke, 2005). Autophagy is induced above basal levels in response to diverse stimuli including nutrient starvation (or trophic factor withdrawal that leads to starvation), genotoxic agents, phorbol ester with zVAD-fmk, or cytokines (Boya et al., 2005; Kuma et al., 2004; Lum et al., 2005; Mills et al., 2004; Shimizu et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004). Numerous reports have implicated induction of autophagy in controlling cell viability. In response to nutrient deprivation or trophic factor withdrawal, autophagy is induced to sustain metabolism by producing

catabolites through the targeted proteolysis of long-lived proteins. In this context, therefore, autophagy acts as a self-limited survival mechanism (Kuma et al., 2004; Lum et al., 2005). Programmed cell death can also be triggered by nutrient deprivation, and autophagy induced in this context can serve to counter the induction of the cell-death program (Boya et al., 2005). Presumably, in this context, autophagy again acts to maintain pools of cellular metabolites to balance the lack of exogenous nutrients. However, autophagosome accumulation is frequently observed within cells undergoing programmed cell death, for example, in cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or in hormoneinduced cell death in the Drosophila salivary gland. This has led to the contrary suggestion that autophagy may promote cell death, with the selective removal of survival factors or prolonged removal of cellular constituents resulting in the demise of the cell (Gozuacik and Kimchi, 2004; Lee and Baehrecke, 2001; Mills et al., 2004; OgierDenis and Codogno, 2003). Importantly, several recent studies have now explicitly assessed autophagy as a potential contributor to programmed cell death. In situations where pro-death stimuli such as genotoxic agents, staurosporine, or phorbol ester are administered to cells, in which proteins that normally effect apoptotic death are either deleted or inhibited, a caspase-independent programmed cell death dependent on autophagy occurs (Shimizu et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004). However, it is unclear how the induction of autophagy downstream of pro-death stimuli affects classical apoptotic caspase-dependent cell death in a physiological context where components of this pathway are not experimentally compromised. It has, however, been suggested that autophagy may promote apoptotic cell death during NGF withdrawal from sympathetic neurons (Xue et al., 1999). However, the generality of this observation is yet to be determined. Furthermore, it has been reported that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members can also modulate autophagy (Pattingre et al., 2005; Shimizu et al., 2004). In the context of nutrient stress, Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of autophagy, via interaction with the autophagy mediator Beclin1, is reduced allowing cells to respond to metabolic stress through induction of autophagy (Pattingre et al., 2005). However, it has also been suggested that Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL), presumably through an alternate mechanism, can promote the autophagy that is a component of nonapoptotic programmed cell death seen in response to staurosporine or etoposide when their binding partners (Bax/Bak) are experimentally removed (Shimizu et al., 2004). It is not known, however, whether Bcl-2 affects autophagy during apoptosis. Overall the question appears to be not whether autophagy per se causes cell death or promotes cell survival, but how different stimuli induce autophagy as a context-speciﬁc mediator of cell death or cell survival. For example, why might pro-death stimuli promote autophagy such that this contributes to programmed cell death, whereas under starvation conditions, autophagy

is induced to maintain viability? Recent work may suggest that in response to different stimuli, autophagy may act to selectively target different protein or organelle cargos. For example, under starvation conditions clearly the nonselective turnover of long-lived proteins would be sufﬁcient to provide catabolites for energy production. In other situations, certain proteins may be speciﬁcally targeted for proteolysis. For example, during the caspase-independent cell death dependent on autophagy, catalase may be speciﬁcally degraded. In contrast, catalase is not selectively removed under nutrient-deprived conditions (Yu et al., 2006). Observations of selective turnover may ultimately resolve the paradoxical roles of autophagy in different contexts. While autophagy may function in different contexts to either promote or inhibit cell survival, downstream of diverse stimuli, the signaling pathways regulating these diverse forms of autophagy remain poorly deﬁned. Clearly therefore, the identiﬁcation of further regulatory factors that signal induction of autophagy, the speciﬁc contexts in which these are important, and how the induced autophagy affects cell viability is required to fully understand cell-death regulation and tumor suppression. We report here the identiﬁcation of a novel stress-induced regulator of autophagy that we have termed DRAM for damage-regulated autophagy modulator. DRAM is a direct target of p53 and, while p53 has previously been shown to modulate autophagy (Feng et al., 2005), we show that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that DRAM is critical for p53-induced cell death and that DRAM is downregulated in human cancer.

RESULTS Identiﬁcation of DRAM To identify novel components of p530 s cell-death response, we used a Saos-2 cell line (null for endogenous p53) that contains a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible p53 transgene (TetOn-p53) (Ryan et al., 2000). Based on the expression proﬁles of two known p53 target genes, p21 and PUMA (el-Deiry et al., 1993; Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al., 2001), we examined mRNA changes 24 hr after p53 induction (data not shown). Microarray analysis revealed a number of mRNA species responsive to p53 over this timeframe. Amongst these, the only previously uncharacterized mRNA that exhibited induction comparable to known p53 targets encodes the hypothetical protein FLJ11259 (accession number BC018435)—referred to here as DRAM. Human DRAM encodes for a polypeptide of 238 amino acids (Figure 1). Analysis of this peptide sequence indicated that DRAM contains a putative signal peptide for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and six hydrophobic potential transmembrane regions (Figure 1A). DRAM is highly conserved in a number of species including mouse, zebraﬁsh, Drosophila, and C. elegans. No orthologs were found, however, in simpler organisms such

as yeast or bacteria. Alignment of these DRAM sequences exempliﬁes this conservation and reveals speciﬁc domains and residues that are conserved (Figure 1B). Regulation of DRAM by p53 and DNA Damage To conﬁrm the induction of DRAM seen in the microarray analysis, mRNA from TetOn-p53 cells treated with Dox for 24 hr was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and realtime quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). In these cells, DRAM was found to be induced 8-fold (Figures 2A and 2B). DRAM was also induced marginally by the transactivation-impaired p53 mutant 175H (Figures 2A and 2B). However, a similar induction was also observed for the wellcharacterized p53 target gene, p21 (Figure S1A). DRAM was also induced by p53 in another cell system containing a p53-ER fusion protein (p53 fused to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor) (Figure 2C) that is responsive to tamoxifen (Tam) (Littlewood et al., 1995). RNA species that are induced by Tam even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g., cycloheximide [CHX]) do not require the synthesis of an intermediary protein and can therefore be considered primary targets of p53. Similar to the activation observed for p21 (Figure S1B), DRAM was induced by p53-ER by approximately 3.5-fold. This induction was also evident in the presence of CHX, indicating that p53-mediated induction of DRAM is a direct effect (Figure 2C). The levels of DRAM were also increased by the addition of CHX alone. This has previously been shown for a number of mRNA species (a

similar effect was seen for p21 mRNA) (Figure S1B) and is considered to indicate that the levels of these transcripts are under the control of either a short-lived transcriptional repressor or a short-lived factor that causes mRNA destabilization (Grandori et al., 1996; Wilson and Freeman, 1996). Nevertheless, the further induction of DRAM by p53 in the presence of CHX indicates that this is a direct effect. Next we tested if DRAM was induced by cellular stresses and if these effects were dependent on activation of endogenous p53. p53 wild-type RKO cells stably expressing either a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to inactivate p53 (pRS-p53) or a nonsilencing shRNA (pRS-Scr) control were treated with the genotoxic agents actinomycin D (Act D), adriamycin, and etoposide. In each case DRAM was dramatically induced in control cells but not in those where p53 was silenced (Figures 2D and 2E)—demonstrating a strong dependency on p53 for induction. Moreover, this dependency was comparable to or greater than that seen for p21 and PUMA (Figures S2A and S2B). Similar effects were also seen when p53 was inactivated by the E6 protein from human papilloma virus (data not shown). These data, taken together, indicate that DRAM is induced by cellular stresses via endogenous p53. Since the p53-mediated induction of DRAM mRNA could not be explained by changes in DRAM mRNA stability (Figure 2F), we sought to determine if DRAM was a direct transcriptional target of p53. We searched the DRAM gene for consensus p53 binding sites using the p53MH

algorithm (Hoh et al., 2002). A number of potential binding sites were identiﬁed within the ﬁrst intron (Figure 2G). Analysis of a number of these sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from TetOn-p53 cells and RKO cells revealed a potential binding site approximately 2.3 kb from the end of exon 1. This site, BS-1, was effectively immunoprecipitated by p53-speciﬁc antisera but not by nonspeciﬁc sera, as was also seen for established p53 response elements from known target genes (Figure 2H) (Tanikawa et al., 2003). Another potential binding site,

BS-2, although having similar predictions of likely responsiveness as BS-1, was not speciﬁcally immunoprecipitated by antisera to p53 (Figure 2H). To test whether the DRAM p53 binding site BS-1 was responsive to p53, a 765 bp region of DRAM intron 1 containing this site was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid. In addition, a reporter construct was also generated containing a 1478 bp region of the intron around the BS-2 site. Transfection of these reporter constructs into Saos-2 cells, together with a p53 expression plasmid,

124 Cell 126, 121–134, July 14, 2006 ª2006 Elsevier Inc.

revealed that the reporter containing BS-1, but not the one containing BS-2, was responsive to p53 (Figure 2I). Moreover, in accordance with mutational analysis of the p53responsive element in the PUMA promoter (Yu et al., 2001), mutation of the BS-1 site in this reporter construct caused a marked reduction in the responsiveness to p53, proving that BS-1 is a p53-responsive element (Figure 2I). Mutation of this site, however, did not completely inactivate the responsiveness of the plasmid, indicating that either the mutation did not completely inactivate p53 binding or that this region of the intron also contains other p53-responsive elements. Involvement of DRAM in Cell Death from p53 Since our data indicate that DRAM is a new direct target of p53, we assessed if DRAM induction contributes to p530 s apoptotic response. Two DRAM-speciﬁc siRNAs were generated that cause considerable knockdown of DRAM expression while not affecting the induction of p53, p21, and PUMA in response to Dox in TetOn-p53 cells or ActD in RKO cells—in which two-thirds of the death is dependent on p53 (Ryan et al., 2000) (Figures 3A, 3B, 3D, 3E and S3). However, both of these siRNAs caused a dramatic decrease in the amount of cell death observed, when compared to cells transfected with nonsilencing siRNA control (Figures 3C and 3F). Moreover, this decrease in death following DRAM knockdown was reﬂected in terms of long-term survival as it was found to cause a considerable increase in the clonogenic potential of RKO cells following transient ActD treatment (Figure 3G). These ﬁndings indicated a major role for DRAM in p53mediated cell death. We therefore assessed whether DRAM was able to induce death when expressed alone. Firstly, we overexpressed DRAM by transient transfection in Saos-2 cells where there are no potential other signals from p53. In contrast to the clear role of DRAM in p53mediated cell death (Figures 3C, 3F, and 3G), DRAM induced very little death in this assay (approximately 2%–3%, Figure 4A) despite conﬁrmation of expression by Western blotting (Figure 4B). However, cell death from DRAM when expressed alone may occur slowly and may not be apparent in transient transfection assays. Therefore, we assayed the ability of DRAM to affect clonogenic survival when expressed continually over a period of time. Saos-2 cells were transfected with selectable expression constructs for wild-type p53, mutant p53, and DRAM. Following selection, cells were assayed for the effects of the transfected plasmids on clonogenicity. Consistent with previous reports, transfection of p53, when compared with cells transfected with mutant p53 or vector alone, caused a dramatic reduction in the number of colonies (Figure 4C). In contrast, but consistent with transient cell-death assays (Figure 4A), expression of DRAM did not alter colony formation (Figure 4C) despite continued DRAM expression in pools of selected colonies (Figure 4D). Taken together, our data suggest that DRAM is necessary but not sufﬁcient for cell death from p53.

DRAM Is a Lysosomal Protein that Regulates Autophagy To examine the function of DRAM further in whole populations of cells and in a temporally controlled manner, we generated a Dox-regulated cell line in p53 null Saos-2 cells that undergoes strong induction of DRAM following treatment with Dox (Figure 5A). Consistent with the data obtained from our death assays (Figures 4A and 4C), DRAM induction causes only a small increase in the number of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content (from 2% to 5% at 24 hr; data not shown). We used these DRAM-inducible cells to determine the subcellular localization of DRAM. Since topology predictions indicated an ER-signal peptide and transmembrane regions (Figure 1A), we would expect DRAM to be localized in the membrane of a compartment of the secretory pathway. Staining for DRAM showed no localization at the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, or the early endosome (data not shown). However, clear colocalization of DRAM was seen when cells were stained with an antibody for cathepsin D, either in the absence or presence of p53, suggesting that DRAM localizes to lysosomes (Figure 5B). Although analysis of endogenous DRAM would be required to conﬁrm this localization, transient transfection of DRAM into Saos-2 and other cell types also revealed a staining pattern coincident with lysosomes (data not shown). Due to the lysosomal localization of DRAM we postulated that DRAM may be regulating cell death in one of two ways. Initially, we considered that DRAM may mediate lysosomal membrane permeabilization causing release of proteolytic enzymes (cathepsins), but inhibitors of cathepsins (zFA-fmk and CA-074) did not affect the small amount of cell death seen following induction of DRAM in TetOn-DRAM cells, despite inhibition of this death with the caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (data not shown). We next assessed, due to an integral role of lysosomes in autophagy, whether DRAM and also p53 (since DRAM is a direct p53 target) regulate autophagy. Analysis by electron microscopy revealed an accumulation of double-membraned autophagic vesicles following induction of either DRAM or p53 (Figures 5C and 5D). Consequently, we next looked for changes in the distribution of the autophagy marker LC3 (Kabeya et al., 2000). The bulk of LC3 exists in a form, LC3-I, which exhibits diffuse staining within the cytoplasm. When autophagosomes form, LC3-I is lipid conjugated to form LC3-II and is associated with the membrane of autophagosomes. Under these conditions, LC3 is visualized in small puncta corresponding to autophagosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000). TetOn-DRAM and TetOn-p53 were infected with an adenovirus expressing LC3 fused to GFP (GFP-LC3) (Bampton et al., 2005). Sixteen hours later cells were induced with Dox and assessed 24 hr later for GFP-LC3 localization. In the absence of Dox, as expected, GFP-LC3 was diffuse within the cytoplasm with occasional puncta representing the basal level of autophagosomes within the cell (Figure 5E). Upon DRAM and p53 induction, similar to what is seen

(A–F) TetOn-p53 cells (A–C) or RKO cells (D–F) were transfected with DRAM siRNAs or a nonsilencing siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were treated for a further 24 hr with Dox (A and B) or 1 nM ActD (D and E). DRAM mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR (A and D) and presented as mean fold activation ± SEM. Protein levels of p53 and p21 were analyzed by Western blotting (B and E). Cell death was assessed by ﬂow cytometry after 48 hr Dox or ActD treatment (C and F). The percentage of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content was taken as a measure of cell death. Data are presented as mean % apoptosis ± SEM. (G) RKO cells were transfected with DRAM siRNAs or a nonsilencing siRNA. After 48 hr the cells were treated with ActD for 24 hr. The cells were then replated in fresh media and assessed for clonogenic survival.

following amino acid and serum starvation (a known inducer of autophagy) (Klionsky and Emr, 2000), a marked increase in the presence of GFP-LC3 puncta was observed, indicating a clear role for DRAM and p53 in the regulation of autophagy (treatment of parental Saos-2 with Dox as control showed no increase in puncta) (Figure 5E). Moreover, when quantiﬁed, approximately 40% of the cells showed considerable GFP-LC3 puncta following p53 and DRAM activation (Figure 5F). We examined next if the ability of p53 to regulate autophagy was dependent on DRAM. TetOn-p53 cells were transfected

with DRAM or nonsilencing siRNAs. Cells were then infected with GFP-LC3 and p53 induced. This revealed that while GFP-LC3 puncta were clearly seen following p53 activation in cells treated with nonsilencing siRNA, those treated with DRAM siRNA displayed a reduced number of GFP-LC3 puncta, indicating an essential role of DRAM in the ability of p53 to modulate autophagy (Figure 5G). Moreover, since LC3-II has a faster electrophoretic mobility than LC3-I, analysis by Western blotting conﬁrmed again that these changes were occurring in the whole population of cells (Figure 5H).

(C and D) The longer term effects of DRAM expression were assayed in relation to clonogenic survival. Saos-2 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type p53, mutant p53, or DRAM. Following selection, cells were replated and assessed for clonogenic survival (C) and long-term expression of myc-tagged DRAM was analyzed by Western blotting (D).

p53 Induces Autophagy in a DRAM-Dependent Manner Although our data clearly show that p53 and DRAM can regulate autophagy, the appearance of autophagosomes does not necessarily indicate induction of autophagy. Since autophagosomes are only transient in this process, being subsequently turned over in autolysosomes, the accumulation of LC3-II puncta could either represent an actual increased induction of autophagy or a decrease in autophagosome turnover. In fact, agents such as Baﬁlomycin A1 that block turnover are known to cause autophagosome accumulation (Figure S4) (Boya et al., 2005). Since autophagy is a mechanism by which long-lived proteins are degraded, analysis of turnover of radiolabeled, long-lived proteins is one way to resolve this issue. Following p53 activation we observed a marked increase in the rate of degradation of long-lived proteins, indicating that p53 induces autophagy (Figure 6A). Moreover, this effect was inhibited not only, as would be expected, by knockdown of the essential autophagy gene ATG5, using a previously described siRNA, but also by knockdown of DRAM (Figures 6A and 6B) (Boya et al., 2005). This therefore conﬁrms that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAMdependent manner. Our results would predict that if DRAM is required for p53 to induce autophagy and cell death, then induction of au-

tophagy may be required for p53-induced apoptotic death. To test this we analyzed p53-induced death following ATG5 knockdown. As this is an undescribed role for ATG5, we used two siRNAs to discount off-target effects. Both siRNAs effectively downregulated ATG5 (Figure 6B) and also caused a dramatic decrease in cell death following treatment of TetOn-p53 cells and RKO cells with Dox and ActD, respectively (Figures 6C and 6D). Furthermore, when DRAM and ATG5 siRNAs were administered together this did not cause any greater reduction in death than DRAM siRNA alone following p53 activation in TetOnp53 cells (despite knockdown efﬁciency similar to that seen in single transfections; data not shown). These data therefore indicate that DRAM and ATG5 potentially both control death through their involvement in autophagy (Figure 6E). Downregulation of DRAM in Human Cancer Since our data are consistent with a potential tumor-suppressive function for DRAM, we assessed if DRAM is perturbed in human cancer. In the ﬁrst instance, we analyzed DRAM expression by qPCR in cultures of primary normal keratinocytes and in a panel of oral tumor cell lines. This revealed that DRAM was signiﬁcantly downregulated in the tumor lines with the average expression level in these lines being approximately half of that in normal cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 7A).

In the cell lines analyzed, the DRAM mRNA was downregulated instead of being completely lost. In many cancers, tumor suppressor gene function can be inactivated without loss or mutation of the gene through epigenetic silencing of gene expression. The most common form of silencing involves cytosine methylation at CpG islands within gene promoters, which is responsible for silencing of tumor suppressors such as those encoded by the INK4A and MLH1 loci (Herman and Baylin, 2003). If methylation is involved in the decreased expression of a particular gene—either directly or through silencing of a positive regulator of the gene—expression of the mRNA can often be enhanced by treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (50 -aza) (Herman and Baylin, 2003). Since the DRAM gene contains a CpG island in its promoter, we tested if 50 -aza could increase the levels of DRAM mRNA in tumor line 8. Indeed, consistent with a role for methylation in loss of DRAM expression, 50 -aza resulted in a considerable increase in DRAM mRNA levels (Figure 7B). Similar results were also seen in tumor line 13 (data not shown). Together, these observations imply that DRAM expression may be subject to methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing in some human cancers. To address this issue further, we performed methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP) analysis on two areas of the DRAM CpG island in a panel of primary squamous tumors (from head and neck and vulva) and tumors of the breast. We detected no evidence of aberrant CpG methylation at either location in 48 cases of breast cancer (data not shown). However, consistent with our analysis of DRAM expression in oral tumor cell lines (Figure 7A), methylation was clearly and reproducibly detected in 16/116 squamous tumors (Table S1). cDNA of adequate quality was available for ﬁve squamous tumors with patient-matched normal tissue, and we therefore performed RT-PCR analysis to assess DRAM expression in these cases. Steady-state levels of DRAM mRNA were reduced in three of the ﬁve cancers relative to matched normal tissue (Figure 7C). These included one case shown to have methylation in the DRAM CpG island but also two cases in which no methylation was detected with either primer pair (Figure 7D). These results imply that downregulation of DRAM mRNA in squamous cancers occurs both by direct hypermethyla-

tion within the CpG island of the gene and also by other, as yet unidentiﬁed, mechanisms, perhaps involving epigenetic modiﬁcation in other genes upstream of DRAM. In light of this, we went back to analyze the level of DRAM expression by qPCR in our panel of tumors and, although matched normal tissue was not available for all tumors, the levels of DRAM expression were assessed by comparison to the average level of expression in available samples of normal tissue (n = 12). This revealed that, consistent with our small analysis of patient-matched normal and tumor samples (Figure 7C and 7D), although all tumors with DRAM promoter methylation had downregulation of DRAM mRNA, DRAM expression was also decreased in some tumors where methylation was not evident. Altogether, 57/116 tumors showed decreased DRAM expression (Table S1). Since DRAM is a p53 target gene, we examined whether DRAM expression was related to the p53 status of the squamous cancers. Of the tumors containing wild-type p53 (and which were HPV-negative), 79% (42/53) exhibited DRAM downregulation. Reciprocally, of those with mutant p53 (or which were HPV-positive), only 23% (15/63) had downregulated DRAM. This difference was highly signiﬁcant (Chi2 = 35.4, p < 0.001). This correlation was even more striking when lesions of vulval origin were analyzed alone—only 18% (3/17) had mutant p53 (or were HPV-positive) and DRAM downregulation, whereas 87% (13/15) had wild-type p53 and DRAM downregulation (Chi2 = 21.0, p < 0.001) (Table S1). Together these results suggest that downregulation of DRAM occurs preferentially in cancers lacking other mechanisms for inactivation of p53. This relationship was, however, not completely reciprocal with some tumors having decreased DRAM levels and mutant p53, indicating therefore that that there may be additional selective pressures to inactivate DRAM over and above its role in p53-mediated tumor suppression. DISCUSSION DRAM Is a Novel Mediator of p53-Induced Autophagy Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that was ﬁrst deﬁned genetically in yeast (Klionsky and Emr, 2000).

Stress-induced induction of DRAM through p53 induces autophagy to co-operate with one or more other p53-dependent apoptotic signals to invoke a full cell-death response.

a number of species. Multiple stimuli induce autophagy in mammalian cells, but little is known about the regulatory pathways downstream of these stimuli. The discovery of DRAM heralds a new regulator of autophagy involved in the induction of autophagy by p53 in response to genotoxic stress. The Relationship of DRAM and Autophagy to Apoptotic Cell Death The identiﬁcation of DRAM as a p53 target mediating induction of autophagy allows exploration of the role of autophagy in apoptosis. Previously, it has been suggested that autophagy may be activated by pro-death stimuli to effect a caspase-independent cell death (Shimizu et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004). However, it was unclear that autophagy had any role in classical apoptosis. We ﬁnd that

DRAM cannot induce apoptosis itself, but DRAM nevertheless is a critical component of p530 s apoptotic response. Our data therefore do not indicate that p53 induces cell death solely by inducing autophagy through DRAM. This supports a model in which p53 both activates DRAM, as well as one or more other proapoptotic genes, and that the signaling pathways regulated by these genes converge, at a yet unidentiﬁed point, to promote a full celldeath response (Figure 7E). In this regard, our initial analysis indicates that while inhibition of DRAM expression does not affect the activation of p53 targets including p21 and PUMA (Figures 3B, 3E, and S3), it does impede the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Figure S6). Further studies are, however, required to determine if this is deﬁnitively the point at which these p53 pathways converge, and how, speciﬁcally, DRAM and potentially

Cell 126, 121–134, July 14, 2006 ª2006 Elsevier Inc. 131

DRAM-induced autophagy contribute to apoptosis. We believe that DRAM contributes to apoptosis through its role in autophagy, as knockdown of ATG5 reveals that autophagy is required for p530 s apoptotic response. However, it remains possible that the apoptotic and autophagic functions of DRAM are separable and act in parallel. Future mutational analysis of DRAM may resolve this issue. Although ATG5 and DRAM are both clearly required for p53-induced death, a further question is whether inhibition of DRAM or autophagy per se through ATG5 knockdown are always equivalent events. It is likely that speciﬁc signaling pathways activate autophagy to effect different outcomes in response to speciﬁc stimuli. We have shown that DRAM is critical for induction of autophagy in the speciﬁc context of p53 activation, whereas ATG5 is predicted to be required for autophagy in all contexts including basal autophagy (Kuma et al., 2004; Mizushima et al., 2001). Future work will address if other pathways involve DRAM. However, with respect to this, while we found that DRAM knockdown can confer a long-term survival advantage to cells treated transiently with ActD, ATG5 does not (data not shown). In fact, chronic knockdown of ATG5 was detrimental to the clonogenic potential of the cells even in the absence of ActD (data not shown). This indicates therefore that the cells have a dependency on ATG5-mediated autophagy for maximal viability long-term, but consistent with a context-speciﬁc role for DRAM-induced autophagy downstream of p53, this role of ATG5 is not downstream of DRAM function. Indeed, the chronic knockdown of DRAM is not detrimental to clonogenic potential in the absence of ActD (data not shown). One might speculate therefore, as is emerging from other context-speciﬁc autophagy studies, that DRAM-induced autophagy turns over a speciﬁc spectrum of proteins, different from other autophagy-inducing signals that also act through ATG5. Perhaps identifying these proteins will help elucidate the mechanism by which DRAM-induced autophagy contributes to cytochrome c release and cell death downstream of p53. Downregulation of DRAM in Cancer We show here that expression of DRAM is downregulated in a subset of epithelial cancers, and we present evidence that downregulation occurs both via direct hypermethylation within the DRAM CpG island and by other mechanisms that do not directly target the DRAM CpG island. This is not the ﬁrst report, however, of a regulator of autophagy being perturbed in human cancer. Beclin1, which has been shown experimentally to be a haploinsufﬁcient tumor suppressor, is mono-allelically deleted in some breast, ovarian, and prostate tumors (Aita et al., 1999; Liang et al., 1999). As with ATG5, one would predict that Beclin1 would affect autophagy downstream of multiple signals and there may be different selective pressures to downregulate DRAM or Beclin1 in different tumor settings. In this regard, it is interesting to note that we saw no meth-

ylation of the DRAM gene and limited downregulation of DRAM mRNA in breast cancers (data not shown) —a tumor type known to exhibit Beclin1 downregulation. The relationship of DRAM mRNA expression to p53 status is also provocative. Although a number of p53 target genes, for example Bax, Apaf-1, and 14-3-3s, have been shown to be inactivated in human cancer, none have shown such a reciprocal relationship to mutation of p53 as has DRAM in squamous tumors (Gasco et al., 2002; Rampino et al., 1997; Soengas et al., 2001). In therapeutic terms this is potentially very exciting. Due to the critical role of DRAM in p53-induced death, it is possible that there are tumors retaining wild-type p53 that are chemoresistant because of the loss of DRAM. The combination therefore of standard chemotherapeutic agents that stimulate p53 with those that mimic DRAM’s role in autophagy may well lead to enhanced tumor cell death. Overall, the discovery of DRAM reveals a novel link in the pathway by which p53 modulates autophagy and suggests that induction of autophagy by p53 via DRAM contributes to apoptotic cell death. This function of DRAM may account for our observed tumor expression proﬁle in squamous cancers indicative of a tumor suppressor. Our elucidation and further investigation of DRAM function may therefore aid our understanding of tumor suppression and lead to the development of novel agents for cancer therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for information on cell line generation, plasmids, sequences for ChIP, microscopy, microarrays, sequence analysis, and statistical tests. Cell Culture and Transfections Saos-2, RKO, and RKO-pRS-Scr, RKO-pRS-p53, TetOn-p53, TetOnp53-175H, and TetOn-DRAM cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and were transfected with CaPO4. TetOn lines were induced with 1 mg/ml Dox (Sigma). For starvation conditions, cells were incubated in Hanks’s Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes. Saos-2 and RKO cells are available from ATCC. TetOn-p53 and TetOn-p53-175H cells have been previously described (Ryan et al., 2000). Primary keratinocyte cultures and oral tumor lines have been previously described—details can be obtained on request (Edington et al., 1995; McGregor et al., 2002). RNAi siRNA oligos (Dharmacon) targeting the following mRNAs were: DRAM, CCACGATGTATACAAGATA (1) and CCACAGAAATCAATGG TGA (2). ATG5, GCAACTCTGGATGGGATTG (1) and CATCTGAGCT ACCCGGATA (2). The nonsilencing sequence was TAAGGCTATGAA GAGATAC. siRNAs were transfected using oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cell-Death Assays Total populations of cells were processed for ﬂow cytometric analysis (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) as previously described (Ryan et al., 2000). The percentage of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content was taken as a measure of apoptotic rate. Clonogenicity assays were performed on cells transfected with the indicated plasmids (Saos-2) or siRNA (RKO). Saos-2 cells were selected with 600 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and after 2 weeks were stained with Giemsa (Sigma).

Protein Degradation After 24 hr, siRNA transfected TetOn-p53 cells were labeled for 6 hr with L-[35S]Met/Cys (5 mCi/ml) (Amersham), washed three times in PBS, then incubated for 16 hr in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM unlabeled L-Met/Cys plus Dox where indicated. The degradation period was started by washing the cells again and replacing with fresh medium. After 4 hr the levels of degraded protein were calculated as previously described (Boya et al., 2005). Immunoblotting Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and proteins quantiﬁed using a BCA assay (Sigma). Equal amounts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels. Membranes were probed with antibodies against: p53 (DO-1, Pharmingen), p38 (#9212, Cell Signaling Technology), myc (4A6, Upstate), actin (clone 1A4, Sigma), p21 (sc-397G, Santa Cruz), GFP (Roche), P-S6K (T421/S424) (Cell Signaling), and ATG5 (a kind gift of Noboru Mizushima) (Mizushima et al., 2001). Proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham). Luciferase Reporter Assays Saos-2 cells were transfected with 5 mg of each reporter plasmid, 5 mg of pJ3Ubgal, and 0.5 mg of either pcDNA3-p53 or empty vector. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were assayed for luciferase activity and values obtained were normalized for transfection efﬁciency following assay for b-gal activity.
