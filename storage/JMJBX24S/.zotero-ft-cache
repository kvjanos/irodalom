Importantly, we study migration patterns and dynamic phenomenon of motile thymocytes and quantify thymocyte contacts with stationary DCs. Prior study [1], based on manual inspection and measurements, was labor intensive, time costly, and error-prone. To overcome these limitations and set the stage for large-scale quantitative multi-spectral multidimensional studies of cell dynamics and interactions, software was developed for efficient inspection, validation and corrective editing. Results from our automated analysis agreed with manually generated measurements to within 7%. Our method entails four steps as shown in Fig. 1. First, two-photon laser scanning microscopy was performed at mouse thymic cortex over 20~40 minutes at 37-second intervals, with a resolution 164×164×40 µms or 256×256×21 voxels at 8 bits at each time point. Fig. 1-A shows sample images of DCs and wild type thymocytes at two successive time points. Second, after un-mixing spectral overlapping across GFP and YFP channels, cells were delineated via mean-shift clustering [2], as displayed in Fig. 1-B. Segmentation outputs were used to measure geometric features of each thymocyte, such as centroid, volume, and radius. Third, thymocytes were traced over time using multiple hypothesis tracking [3]. Tracked cells were consistently numbered and color-coded in Fig. 1-C. Finally, a rich set of dynamic features (e.g. speed, displacement, and directionality index), were computed from tracking results to quantify motility patterns of thymocytes, and duration of thymocyte-DC contacts undergoing signal selection events (Fig. 1-D). To ensure the validity of machine-generated outputs, we developed a Matlab-based tool (Fig. 1-E) to automatically evaluate and high-light statistical outliers for further inspection and editing.
