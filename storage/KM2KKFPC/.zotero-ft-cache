Abstract
Fluorescence imaging is an important tool for molecular biology research. There is a wide array of ﬂuorescent labels and activatable probes available for investigation of biochemical processes at a molecular level in living cells. Given the large number of potential imaging agents and numerous variables that can impact the utility of these ﬂuorescent materials for imaging, selection of the appropriate probes can be a difﬁcult task. In this report an overview of ﬂuorescent imaging agents and details on their optical and physical properties that can impact their function are presented. Key words: Fluorescence, ﬂuorescent labels, ﬂuorogenic probes, sensors, microscopy, imaging.

1. Introduction
Fluorescence imaging is a vital tool for the investigation of biological processes in the ﬁelds of cell, molecular, and systems biology. Its development has had a profound impact on our ability to decipher how these systems function at the cellular and molecular level. The development of ﬂuorescence microscopy as an investigative tool has its origins in the 1850s with the ﬁrst descriptions of “refrangible radiations” from biological materials by George Stokes (1). These radiations were later named ﬂuorescence. However, the use of ﬂuorescence as a diagnostic tool in microscopy would remain undeveloped until the construction of the ﬁrst UV light microscopes by August K¨ hler in 1904 (2). o Not long after the work of K¨ hler, the ﬁrst purpose-built ﬂuoreso cence microscopes were prepared, but it was not until the 1960s

that these instruments became commonplace. Some of the ﬁrst ﬂuorescence microscopy experiments focused on observation of the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of the biological samples under investigation (3). These investigations were invaluable for expanding our understanding of physiology, but they provided little insight on the function of biochemical and other physiological processes at a molecular level. For a more in depth investigation of these processes within the cell, a switch from intrinsic to extrinsic ﬂuorophores is necessary. Today, numerous ﬂuorescent materials are available for use in ﬂuorescence microscopy. Fluorescent compounds suitable for live cell imaging can be divided into two broad categories: labels and responsive probes. Fluorescent labels are imaging agents whose ﬂuorescence signal remains constant. Good labels are typiﬁed by stable optical properties that do not vary signiﬁcantly as a function of their local environment. These ﬂuorescent species are often coupled with targeting groups or have genetically controlled expression. Responsive probes do not rely on preferential uptake or targeting. These sensors rely on changes in ﬂuorescence intensity, wavelength, or lifetime for their function, and can be small molecule, polymer, or nanoparticle based. In this report we will provide an overview of current ﬂuorescent labels and probes for use in live cell imaging of molecular processes.

2. Fluorescent Labels
The ﬁrst advances toward the development of modern ﬂuorescent labels are credited to the immunologist, Albert Coons in the 1940s. In his early research, he developed ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (4), which remains one of the most ubiquitous ﬂuorescent labels today, for coupling to antibodies targeted against pneumococcal bacteria. Today, targeted labels are among the most commonly employed ﬂuorescent imaging agents. In addition to antibodies, targeting groups can be proteins, peptides, DNA aptamers, small molecule ligands, or stains for speciﬁc macromolecular structures. The emissive reporters in these labels can be ﬂuorophores, ﬂuorescent or bioluminescent proteins, or nanoparticles such as quantum dots. The efﬁcacy of imaging with these compounds is dependent on their speciﬁc uptake, sequestration, or expression at a subcellular level.
2.1. Small Molecule Fluorophores

Prior to the development of FITC labels, a limited number of ﬂuorophores with synthetic handles suitable for bioconjugation were available. Many of these early labels were based on dyes with ﬂuorescence excitation in the UV (5). The ﬂuorescence emission

signals from these dyes can be difﬁcult to separate from tissue autoﬂuorescence. In contrast, today there is a vast and often confusing array of ﬂuorophore labels available to scientists. These ﬂuorophores span the optical spectrum from the UV to the visible and extend into the near infrared (6–12). Many of the currently available amine reactive ﬂuorophores are summarized in Fig. 2.1 and the structures of some representative labels are shown in Fig. 2.2. Several factors must be considered in choosing the appropriate ﬂuorophores for constructing effective imaging agents. These include method of attachment to the targeting group, excitation and emission wavelengths, brightness, hydrophilicity, and cost. There are many current chemistries available for the coupling of ﬂuorescent labels to biomolecules and targeting groups (Fig. 2.3). The most frequently employed synthetic handle for bioconjugation is the succinimidyl ester, which forms stable amide bonds after reaction with primary and secondary amines. The isothiocyanate group may also be used for coupling to amines, generating a thiourea linkage. In cases where reaction of a succinimidyl ester or isothiocyanate derivatized ﬂuorophore with an amine is not feasible, additional coupling groups are available. Iodoacetamide, maleimide, and dithiol-modiﬁed ﬂuorophores are useful for covalent conjugation to thiols. Hydrazine and hydrazide modiﬁed dyes can be used for coupling to aldehydes and ketones, forming relatively stable hydrazone linkages. More recently, the development of bioorthogonal coupling schemes has attracted signiﬁcant interest for preparation of ﬂuorescent probes. Bioorthogonal couplings rely on use of reaction partners that display little or no reactivity with common biological materials. Two examples of these reactions are the Staudinger ligation (13) and the “click” reaction (14). The Staudinger ligation involves coupling of a methyl ester electrophilic trap with an azide to generate an amide linkage and one equivalent of N2 . This reaction is mediated by oxidation of an adjacent phosphine. The click reaction is a copper(I) catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between an azide and an alkyne that results in the formation of a stable triazole product (14). This reaction has excellent potential for use in design of targeted ﬂuorescent probes. However, there are only a few azide or alkyne modiﬁed dyes currently available for this reaction, most of which emit in the visible region. The potential utility of the click reaction in biology suggests that in the coming years the selection of azide and alkyne modiﬁed dyes is likely to expand greatly. For example, recent efforts have yielded new, efﬁcient synthetic routes to far-red/near infrared emitting cyanine dyes modiﬁed with either azide or alkyne groups, one example of which, CyAM-5 alkyne, is shown in Fig. 2.2 (15). Although highly selective, cytotoxic copper(I) is necessary for the traditional click coupling, and therefore direct use of this reaction in living biological systems has not been possible. The

issue of copper cytotoxicity in the click reaction has been overcome by Bertozzi and others via preparation of new ringstrained cyclooctyne derivatives that do not require a catalyst (16–18). The coupling of cyclooctyne containing ﬂuorophores with azide-modiﬁed sugars has been demonstrated for imaging

of surface glycosylation in live cells (16) and zebra ﬁsh embryos (19). Another bioorthogonal conjugation strategy compatible with live cells was reported in 2008 (20, 21). This coupling scheme involves use of an inverse-electron demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition between a modiﬁed tetrazine and a norbornene dienophile (20). The tetrazine-based coupling shows excellent selectivity in biological media and was used to label SKBR3 breast cancer cells that were pre-treated with norbornene modiﬁed trastuzumab (Fig. 2.4). The availability of labels for use with classical and bioorthogonal coupling reactions provides a wide selection of methods for attachment of ﬂuorescent reporters to biological targets. The choice of coupling chemistry will be dependent on the speciﬁc reactive chemical groups available on the targeting molecule such as amines, thiols, or ketones. When the coupling or labeling reaction must be performed in a biological environment in the presence of live cells, the copper-free click reaction, Staudinger ligation, or the tetrazine cycloaddition reactions are appropriate conjugation methods.

Coupling chemistries have been used to prepare a wide array of imaging agents utilizing antibodies, aptamers, peptides, and small molecules. For example, anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) antibodies conjugated with IRDye 800 were used to show antibody binding to HER2 expressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells and for in vivo ﬂuorescence imaging in a mouse

model (22). DNA aptamers have also been used to target tumor cells (23). In much the same way, peptides have been coupled to a variety of ﬂuorophores for preparation of several targeted imaging agents. This strategy has been widely used for targeting the 3 integrin cell adhesion molecule with the RGD peptide motif for investigation of cancer cells and tissues (24–27). Targeting approaches need not be limited to short peptides. Larger peptides and proteins may also be used for directed delivery of optical reporters. Probes for selective imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been prepared via conjugation of Cy5.5 ﬂuorophores to the 6-kDa epidermal growth factor protein. This probe was demonstrated to speciﬁcally home in on MDA-MB-468 cancer cells, which have high EGFR expression levels, but not to MDA-MB-435 cells which do not express EGFR (28). Small molecule based targeting strategies have also been employed through use of well-known bioactive small molecules such as folate (29) or through combinatorial approaches (30). Peptide-based targeting has been expanded to incorporate bacteriophage nanoparticles as multivalent peptide carriers. This allows for facile integration of peptide screening for the cellular target of interest (via use of bacteriophage display libraries) with optical imaging and microscopy techniques. The M13 bacteriophage, commonly used in bacteriophage screening, has randomized peptide libraries displayed on its pIII coat proteins. The bacteriophage particles also contain 2700 copies of the pVIII coat protein, which have their amino termini exposed to the solvent. These amine groups are available for bioconjugation to ﬂuorophores. Therefore, once a phage clone speciﬁc for the receptor of interest is identiﬁed, it can be modiﬁed via standard succinimide or isothiocyanate coupling procedures to prepare a ﬂuorescent targeted imaging probe. This strategy was ﬁrst demonstrated in 2004 (31) and further expanded for other imaging applications (32–34). In addition to the bioconjugation strategy and selection of the targeting group, the optical properties of the ﬂuorophore are another important factor in the design of targeted probes for live cell imaging. Although there are many ﬂuorophores with excitation and emission in the UV, these ﬂuorescent labels are not appropriate for certain imaging applications due to concerns regarding exposure of the cells to UV light, which may disrupt normal cell function. UV excitation may also result in higher background ﬂuorescence signal from the sample, arising from the excitation of intrinsic biological ﬂuorophores. Problems may occur with other common dyes, such ﬂuorescein. Fluorescein is a pH-sensitive dye with a ﬂuorogenic pKa of 6.4; therefore, ﬂuorescent labels containing ﬂuorescein may display distinctly different ﬂuorescence emission intensities depending upon the pH of their local environment. Consequently, for imaging

applications where the probe signal will be quantiﬁed, ﬂuorescein may not be suitable. Other ﬂuorophores with similar excitation and emission such as BODIPY FL or AF488 (6), which is based on a pH-insensitive rhodamine scaffold, are more appropriate for use in experiments requiring probe quantiﬁcation. In many applications, labels with ﬂuorescence emission in the NIR are preferred. NIR-emitting ﬂuorophores are not susceptible to interference from biological autoﬂuorescence and are directly translatable to many in vivo imaging applications due to the increased optical transparency of biological tissue between ∼650 and 1000 nm (35). Fluorophores can show distinct changes in their ﬂuorescence intensity and/or ﬂuorescence emission wavelength based on the polarity of their local environment. The ﬂuorescence quantum yields and emission wavelengths of dansyl ﬂuorophores are well known to vary with the polarity of the surrounding media. Solvent polarity-based changes in ﬂuorescence emission wavelengths and quantum yields can often be minimized by increasing the polarity of the ﬂuorophore. Fluorophores that show little or no polarity-dependent changes on their optical properties tend to contain one or more solubilizing groups such as sulfonate or carboxylate moieties. For example, the optical properties of the near infrared emitting ﬂuorophore, Cy5.5, which has four sulfonate groups, are relatively insensitive to changes in the local microenvironment. Many ﬂuorophores can be modiﬁed to act as optical switches that are activated by exposure to UV light. Several applications have made use of these photoactivatable or “caged” ﬂuorophores. Caged ﬂuorophores have been employed in dynamic imaging applications where speciﬁc temporal and spatial activation of a small population of ﬂuorophore labels is required. These masked ﬂuorophores, such as caged ﬂuorescein, are prepared by reaction of the ﬂuorophore with o-nitrobenzylbromide to form the non-ﬂuorescent photoactivatable compound (36). The ﬂuorescence can be activated by irradiation at 365 nm to cleave the o-nitrobenzyl group, releasing the free ﬂuorophore (Fig. 2.5). In one early demonstration of this approach, microtubule ﬂux in the mitotic spindle was monitored following photoactivation of caged ﬂuorescein-labeled tubulin (36). Similarly, a caged resoruﬁn was used to observe intracellular actin ﬁlament dynamics (37). More recently, a series of cell permeable caged coumarin derivatives (38, 39) has been designed for the study of intercellular gap junctions. After intracellular delivery of these caged ﬂuorophores, a small population of the caged coumarins was activated and used as a ﬂuorescent reporter to monitor the migration of the dye molecules through the gap junctions (39). The brightness of the ﬂuorophore is a key consideration. When targeting cellular components that are expressed in low levels, the ﬂuorescence signal from the optical reporter needs to

be bright. The brightness is deﬁned as the product of the ﬂuorescence quantum yield and extinction coefﬁcient of the ﬂuorophore. For imaging low concentrations of cellular targets, weak ﬂuorophores such as those based on NBD or pyrene may not be suitable. Some of the brightest ﬂuorophores emitting in the visible are based on rhodamine or BODIPY scaffolds. Both of these ﬂuorophore classes are typiﬁed by quantum yields approaching unity and extinction coefﬁcients of 80,000 M–1 cm–1 or more. In the far-red/NIR there are many bright ﬂuorophores (6). Common NIR-emitting cyanine dyes are typiﬁed by large extinction coefﬁcients often exceeding 200,000 M–1 cm–1 and quantum yields of 20% or greater (10). However, the ﬂuorescence quantum yields of ﬂuorophores with emission > 800 nm begin to drop off considerably (34). This is the result of the relatively small energy difference between the ground and the excited states of these dyes, which allows for enhanced non-radiative decay of the ﬂuorophore from the excited state. The polarity of the ﬂuorophore is an important factor in imaging agent design and may have a signiﬁcant impact on the function of the ﬂuorescent label. Many popular ﬂuorescent labels are highly water-soluble polar species. Examples include AF488, ﬂuorescein, sulforhodamine 101, and most cyanine-based farred/NIR ﬂuorophores. Imaging agents using polar ﬂuorophores may not be able to cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion processes. Unless a targeted energy dependent transport mechanism is utilized, they are better suited for use as components of ﬂuorescent reporters for imaging cell membrane or extracellular matrix components. Other ﬂuorescent labels, such as DNA stains, rely on the permeability properties of the cell membrane for their function. These charged ﬂuorescent molecules are often unable to penetrate healthy cells with intact membranes. If the membrane is compromised, as occurs with apoptotic or necrotic cells, these

26

dyes are able to enter the cell. One common method for preparing cell-permeable labels relies on the activity of intracellular esterases. The acetate or acetoxymethyl ester derivatives of many xanthene dye derivatives, such as ﬂuorescein, are non-ﬂuorescent, and nonpolar, so that they may enter the cell via passive diffusion processes. Once inside the cell, the ﬂuorescence signal of these ﬂuorophores may be unmasked by intracellular esterase activity, which cleaves the acetyl groups from the ﬂuorescein backbone, regenerating ﬂuorescein. The free ﬂuorescein is negatively charged under physiological conditions and therefore becomes trapped inside the cell (Fig. 2.6).

Many of the more elaborate commercially available ﬂuorophores are expensive, often costing over $200/mg. Certain imaging applications may require large quantities of probe, especially those involving in vivo microscopy. There are several more affordable ﬂuorophore options with ﬂuorescence emission in the visible range, such as ﬂuorescein and rhodamine isothiocyanate derivatives (7). In contrast, there are few inexpensive commercially available NIR-emitting ﬂuorophores, although efﬁcient and inexpensive routes to prepare conjugatable ﬂuorophores emitting in the NIR from commercially available precursors have been developed. The most common synthetic method is via nucleophilic attack on chloride containing carbocyanine precursors to install carboxylic acid functionality (34, 40, 41). These reactions can often be performed in a simple one-pot procedure with > 90% efﬁciency and do not require any puriﬁcation step (34, 42).
2.2. Quantum Dot Labels

Luminescent semiconducting nanocrystals (QDs) are commonly used as labels for imaging at the cellular and subcellular levels (43 , 44). As with small molecule ﬂuorophores, QDs have been

used for imaging a variety of cellular and subcellular targets. For example, targeting HER2 receptors on breast cancer cells and cytoplasmic actin and microtubule ﬁbers has been demonstrated (44). Quantum dots are available with amine or carboxylic acid surface groups for bioconjugation reactions and come in a wide range of emission colors from the visible to NIR (6). Unlike organic dyes, quantum dots may be excited over a broad wavelength range with the highest extinction coefﬁcients, often greater than 1,000,000 M–1 cm–1 , observed in the UV. These materials have several advantages over traditional ﬂuorophores. The broad excitation range of QDs allows for simultaneous excitation of multiple quantum dots with different emission wavelengths using a single wavelength light source. Furthermore, QDs are not susceptible to rapid photobleaching under intense excitation, and therefore may be more suitable for confocal and other microscopy techniques, which require prolonged high intensity light exposure. Despite their signiﬁcant advantages, QDs are not ideal for all imaging applications. Issues concerning QD blinking may complicate single molecule imaging experiments. Many quantum dots materials contain toxic cadmium (45), which was recently shown to leach out of the nanocrystal cores into the surrounding environment under certain biologically relevant conditions (46). In addition, commercially available QDs typically have a hydrodynamic diameter of 20–30 nm, signiﬁcantly larger than small molecule organic ﬂuorophores. The large size of the quantum dots may be a liability for imaging applications where the size of the ﬂuorescent reporter could interfere with the function of the biological process under investigation. Actin ﬁbers labeled with QDs have a proportionally decreased percent motility when compared to the corresponding AF488 organic ﬂuorophore labeled ﬁlaments (47). Additionally, larger QDs may not be suited for monitoring fast diffusing neurotransmitters (48). As a result of their potential limitations for monitoring certain cellular processes, signiﬁcant effort has been put forth to design improved quantum dots for live cell imaging applications. A large fraction of the typical QD diameter comes from polymer surface coating of the particles; therefore, efforts to decrease the thickness of this coating while maintaining ideal solubility characteristics could open QDs to new potential imaging applications. Following this strategy, QDs employing a short polyethylene glycol modiﬁed dihydrolipoic acid head group with a hydrodynamic diameter of 11 nm have been reported (49). Furthermore, the new smaller QDs have been engineered to contain only one site for biological labeling (49). Glutamate receptors labeled with the new, smaller QDs displayed a demonstrably improved ability to diffuse into neuronal synapses in comparison the corresponding commercial QD labeled receptors.

2.3. Genetically Encoded Labels

The researchers Roger Tsien, Martin Chalﬁe, and Samu Shimomura were recently awarded the 2008 Nobel prize in chemistry for their pioneering research on the identiﬁcation, cloning, and modiﬁcation of ﬂuorescent proteins (50). Like QDs, genetically encoded ﬂuorescent or chemiluminescent proteins are becoming commonplace. Recent reviews provide a comprehensive overview (51, 52). As with quantum dots and organic ﬂuorophores, attention has been paid to developing ﬂuorescent proteins in a rainbow of emission colors. Dozens of variants of these ﬂuorescent proteins have been detailed in the literature (51), several of which are in use today with emission in the blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and far red from EGFP, EYFP, mOrange, mCherry, and mPlum, respectively. Unlike QDs and small molecule ﬂuorophores, these species are useful in imaging applications where they can be used to monitor gene expression (53). Fluorescent proteins are also well suited for investigation of chemotaxis. Fluorescent protein expressing cells were used to investigate the role of the hematopoietic protein-1 (HEM-1) complex in cell motility (54, 55). The use of ﬂuorescent proteins has been advantageous for the investigation of cell mitosis after challenge of human MDA cells with the anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics docetaxel (56) and paclitaxel (57). Bioluminescent enzymes, like ﬂuorescent proteins, are genetically encoded labels, although they require an additional substrate to generate a luminescent signal. Bioluminescent proteins have been isolated from a variety of organisms such as Photinus pyralis (ﬁreﬂy) (58), Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) (59), and Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus (click beetle) (60,61) with emission at ∼480, ∼560, and ∼600 nm, respectively. The ﬁreﬂy and click beetle luciferases use luciferin, whereas the sea pansy luciferase requires colenterazine as a substrate. The lux operon may be used to investigate bacterial systems. This operon encodes both the luciferase and other proteins necessary for synthesis of the luciferin substrate (62, 63).

3. Responsive Probes
The use of targeted ﬂuorescent labels and genetically encoded ﬂuorophores has been invaluable in expanding our understanding of how the molecular machinery of the cell functions. However, these probes do not provide a detailed direct view of the function of many signaling molecules and messengers involved in cellular function. To investigate the interactions of these molecules, activatable or switchable smart probes are necessary.

Labels and Probes for Live Cell Imaging

29

The phenomenon of ﬂuorescence is a particularly versatile process, with many different parameters that can be utilized for development of activatable probes. These properties include ﬂuorescence intensity shifts, wavelength shifts, chemiluminescence activation, and ﬂuorescence lifetime changes. Of these photophysical properties, most often biochemical probes are based on strategies to develop turn-on or wavelength-shift probes. Optimized ﬂuorogenic probes share many selection criteria with targeted ﬂuorescent labels. Factors to consider include biocompatibility and water solubility of the probes, suitability for extracellular or intracellular delivery, brightness of the ﬂuorophore, and ﬂuorescence excitation and emission wavelengths. In addition to these variables, other circumstances may inﬂuence the choice of probe. For example, selectivity of the imaging agent for the enzyme or analyte of interest is an important consideration. It is typically quite difﬁcult to design a ﬂuorogenic probe that displays complete selectivity to the target of interest. Virtually every known probe displays at least some basal activation by competing analytes or enzymes. The magnitude and mode of the ﬂuorescence response is another factor. Typically activatable probes displaying an increase in emission or shifts in the absorption or emission spectra are preferred. Many turn-off ﬂuorescence based sensors have been designed, but these agents are more difﬁcult to use for cell imaging due to complications arising from detecting ﬂuorescence decreases by microscopy. Turn-on probes can often be designed to show extremely strong ﬂuorescence activation, often over 100-fold, but may not be suitable for experiments where quantitative measurements are required. With an off–on ﬂuorescence response, it is difﬁcult to account for baseline ﬂuorescence signal arising from the non-activated probe and variations in the local concentration of the imaging agent. When quantitative measurements are required, sensors with a ratiometric ﬂuorescence response are preferred. These sensors are suitable for quantitative measurements of analyte concentration because they allow for determination of the ﬂuorescence activation in a manner independent of the local probe concentration. In the following sections, an overview of current turn-on and wavelengthshift ﬂuorescence-based probes for bioimaging will be presented.
3.1. Enzyme Activation

Many enzyme activatable probes are based on the well-known phenomenon of self-quenching by organic ﬂuorophores when held in close proximity to each other. An early example of this strategy in a ﬂuorogenic probe suitable for use with live cells is a NIR-emitting ﬂuorescent sensor for cathepsin D activity (Fig. 2.7). Cathepsin D is an aspartic protease that is known to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells. The probe consists of a polylysine polymer backbone modiﬁed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers on the lysine side chains to improve solubility of the probe.

30

Fig. 2.7. Enzymatic activation of a polylysine based NIR activatable probe for cathepsin D.

In addition, several of the lysine side chains are further modiﬁed with a cathepsin D speciﬁc cleavage sequence containing NIRemitting Cy5.5 ﬂuorophores (64). Up to 24 Cy5.5 ﬂuorophores are incorporated per polylysine polymer. The high density of ﬂuorophores allows for efﬁcient self-quenching of the dyes. In this case, more than 99% of the ﬂuorescence emission of the Cy5.5 ﬂuorophores is quenched in the probe (64). Upon cleavage of the probe with cathepsin D, up to 60-fold increase in ﬂuorescence signal is possible. The effectiveness of this probe was demonstrated in vivo by imaging of mice bearing cathepsin D positive tumors where a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 22.8 was reported between tumor and non-target tissue (65). This ﬂexible design strategy for enzyme activatable probes is useful for both endo- and exopeptidase enzymes. In addition to cathepsin D, ﬂuorogenic probes for other enzymes such as cathepsin K, caspase-1, and MMP-2 utilizing this activation strategy have been reported (66–68). An alternative strategy employed for the design of enzyme activatable probes does not rely on dye–dye quenching interactions. Instead, its ﬂuorescence switching is based on chemical modiﬁcation of the ﬂuorophore reporter to alter its optical emission properties. One method for achieving this is by alterating the electronic structure of the ﬂuorophore via formation of covalent bonds on portions of the ﬂuorophore that are directly involved in ﬂuorescence emission. For example, many classes of ﬂuorophores such as 7-amino coumarins, rhodamines, ﬂuoresceins, and Nile blue derivatives have amine or phenoxy groups that are part of their conjugated chromophore system and are available for chemical modiﬁcation. Modiﬁcation of these groups often has a dramatic effect on the ﬂuorescence emission of the ﬂuorophore. These changes are typiﬁed by strong hipsochromic shifts of the absorption maximum of the dye and a concomitant blue shift of

Labels and Probes for Live Cell Imaging

31

the emission maximum. In many cases, the quantum yield of the modiﬁed ﬂuorophore is also signiﬁcantly decreased. Enzyme activatable probes using this strategy can often show greater than 100-fold activation. This approach is useful for detection of enzymatic activity from exopeptidases. Many of these ﬂuorogenic enzyme substrates have been prepared by conjugation of an amine group on 7-amino coumarin or rhodamine 110 to the carboxy terminus of a peptide sequence speciﬁc for the enzyme of interest. Formation of the amide bond on the coumarin or rhodamine abolishes the characteristic ﬂuorescence emission at approximately 430 or 520 nm for the coumarin and rhodamine, respectively. Enzyme action on the substrate releases the coumarin and restores its ﬂuorescent signal. A range of ﬂuorogenic probes for peptidases activated by cathepsins (69), caspases (70, 71), elastases (72), and trypsin (72) have been developed using this approach. This strategy has also been adapted to ﬂuorogenic probes for sugars and phosphatases (73).
3.2. Metal Ion Sensing

The design of effective probes for metal ions faces many challenges. The primary concerns are selectivity, metal ion afﬁnity, and ﬂuorescence response. There are numerous activatable and ratiometric ﬂuorescence-based sensors for detection of bio-relevant ions such as Ca2+ , Mg2+ , Na2+ , K2+ , Zn2+ , Cu2+ , Fe3+ , and H+ . However, with the exception of pH responsive sensors (H+ ions), nearly every metal ion probe has side reactivity with analytes other than the targeted metal ion. Therefore the presence or absence of potential interfering ions inﬂuences the probe choice. The afﬁnity of the analyte to the probe is another factor. The Kd values for analyte dissociation from the ﬂuorescence-based sensor should be matched to the expected concentration of the ion under investigation to yield optimal response. Fluorescent probes for calcium ions form one of the most diverse classes of metal ion sensors. The wide array of probes is in part due to the importance of calcium as a signaling molecule in biology. Cellular Ca2+ plays many functional and regulatory roles from muscle ﬁber contraction to signal transduction. Dozens of Ca2+ responsive sensors have been detailed in the literature, and a complete review of these probes is beyond the scope of this chapter. For more detailed information on Ca2+ probes, there are several excellent literature reviews (74, 75). Calcium ion probes can be divided into two broad categories: intensity based and ratiometric. Probes in both classes have a wide range of reported Kd values. For example, the ﬂuorogenic Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, -6F, and -5 N probes, which are all based on the BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N ,N -tetraacetic acid) chelating group have tunable Ca2+ Kd values. By varying the substituents on the BAPTA chelator, the Kd for Ca2+ can be altered from 170 nM to 20 M (Fig. 2.8) (6). Many low afﬁnity

calcium binders also display selectivity for Mg2+ . The Mg2+ probe Mag-Fluo-4 has Kd values of 4.7 mM and 22 M for Mg2+ and Ca2+ , respectively (6). The Mg2+ binding of this probe is well matched to the typical sub- to low-millimolar cellular magnesium levels (76). Ratiometric probes for Ca2+ can either show a change in absorption wavelength or emission wavelength upon coordination of the divalent ion. Examples include Fura-2 and Indo-1 for absorption and emission wavelength shift sensors, respectively (77). Ratiometric response with both classes of probes is possible, although sensors showing shifts in ﬂuorescence emission are preferable since only one excitation source is necessary. This is particularly important in applications where laser excitation is used or where analysis will be performed by ﬂow cytometry. In addition to activatable probes for calcium, which were ﬁrst reported in the early 1980s (78), recent years have seen the development of selective probes for many other metal ions. In the past decade signiﬁcant attention has been directed toward imaging intracellular zinc to investigate its roles in biological homeostasis and signal transduction. Here we give an overview of several widely applied sensors for zinc. For a more complete survey of current Zn2+ selective probes, please see one of several recent reviews (79–81). Much of the pioneering work on design of efﬁcient ﬂuorescence-based zinc sensors originated in the Lippard and Nagano laboratories. The Lippard lab has reported a series of ﬂuorescein-based probes for zinc using the dipicolylamine chelating group (82–85). The earliest of these probes, Zinpyr-1 displays a threefold increase in emission upon binding Zn2+ and has a 0.7 nM binding afﬁnity (82). Sensors with decreased Zn2+ afﬁnity have subsequently been prepared via replacement of one of the pyridyl arms of the dipicolylamine chelating motif with thiophene or thioether coordinating groups, decreasing the binding afﬁnity

from the low nM to M (Fig. 2.9) (86). One of these low-afﬁnity probes, ZS5 was used to visualize glutamate-mediated Zn(II) uptake in dendrites and Zn(II) release resulting from nitrosative stress (86). As with Lippard, Nagano has focused on design of ﬂuorescent Zn2+ sensors based on the ﬂuorescein scaffold. Probes of the ZnAF family have low ﬂuorescence background and strong activation of up to 69-fold upon Zn2+ coordination (87, 88). These sensors have been used to visualize Zn2+ release in the rat hippocampus (88) and to monitor presynaptic Zn2+ pools (89). Systematic modiﬁcation of the dipicolylamine chelating moiety on these probes has enabled preparation of ZnAF probes with Kd values ranging from 2.7 nM to 600 M (90). The ratiometric Zn2+ probes FuraZin and IndoZin, which are based on the related Fura and Indo Ca2+ sensors, (91) were used to monitor intracellular zinc uptake (92). Both FuraZin and IndoZin are excited at short wavelength (<400 nm) (91). To minimize potential phototoxic effects of UV excitation, long-wavelength ratiometric probes such as Zin-naphthopyr-1 (ZNP1), which has a 0.55 nM Zn2+ afﬁnity, were designed (Fig. 2.9) (93). The ZNP1 probe has dual emission at 545 and 624 nm, where increasing [Zn2+ ] induces a dramatic increase in the 624-nm emission signal. The diacetate derivative of this probe is membrane permeable and was used to image release of Zn2+ from COS-7 cells in real time (93). A NIRemitting ratiometric probe, DIPCY, is based on a carbocyanine ﬂuorophore scaffold (94) This probe, which has a Zn2+ Kd of 98 nM, displays an approximate 50 nm red-shift in its absorbance spectrum upon binding zinc. Ion selective probes for H+ are one of the oldest and most studied classes of ion sensors. Their development and use has been vital for investigation of pH changes in the endosomal/lysosomal system. Furthermore, disruption of acid/base homeostasis is associated with the pathophysiology of diseases such as cancer, cystic ﬁbrosis, and immune dysfunction (95–98). Many ﬂuorophores

34

have intrinsic pH sensitivity. For example, ﬂuorescein has a ﬂuorogenic pKa of approximately 6.4 and has been used as a dual excitation single emission ratiometric probe for intracellular pH (99, 100). However, ﬂuorescein can leak from cells and is used infrequently as a stand-alone probe for intracellular ratiometric pH imaging. New nanomaterials doped with FITC have been developed for ratiometric pH imaging. In one example, ﬂuorescein and rhodamine isothiocyanate ﬂuorophores (the rhodamine is used as a pH insensitive reference) were incorporated into core/shell silica nanoparticles and used for monitoring pH in intracellular compartments of mast cells (101). The dual excitation-single emission pH probe BCECF is one of the most widely used pH probes and is a ﬂuorescein derivative modiﬁed with two carboxyethyl groups in the 2 and 7 positions of the dye. These additional carboxylate groups signiﬁcantly improve intracellular retention of the sensor and contribute to an increase in the pH responsive pKa to 6.97 (102). However, as a result of its dual excitation single-emission response, it is not ideal for imaging with laser microscopes or for ﬂow cytometry experiments. To address this, single excitation dual emission pH responsive ﬂuorophores were developed. In the early 1990s the seminaphthorhodaﬂuor scaffold was designed for ratiometric pH imaging (103). In addition to having a single excitation dual emission response to pH with a pKa of approximately 7.5, the probe exhibits red-shifted emission between 600 and 640 nm (103). One of these derivatives, carboxy-SNARF-1 has been used for imaging intracellular pH in chicken embryo epithelial cells (104). Probes for sensing pH can also be combined with targeting strategies. A series of pH responsive ﬂuorogenic boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) ﬂuorophores with tunable pKa values between 3.8 and 6.0 were recently reported. These ﬂuorophores can be conjugated to targeting groups such as trastuzumab for use as ﬂuorescencebased switches and are activated by internalization into the endosomal/lysosomal system of cancer cells (105). NIR ﬂuorescent probes for pH sensing show potential for use in intracellular and in vivo pH measurement. Most current NIR pH probes are based on the carbocyanine scaffold. In one approach, dealkylation of one or both of the indole nitrogens on a non-pH responsive carbocyanine ﬂuorophore renders it sensitive to pH (Fig. 2.10) (106–109). In contrast to xanthene based pH sensors, the carbocyanine dyes show an increase in ﬂuorescence emission as the pH decreases. These probes have been used to monitor agonist-induced G protein-coupled receptor internalization into CHO or Hek293 cells (106). One pH responsive dye HCyC-646 with a ﬂuorogenic pKa of 6.2 and ﬂuorescence emission at 670 nm was paired with pH insensitive Cy7 ﬂuorophores on a bacteriophage particle scaffold for use as an nanoscale NIR ratiometric pH sensor (109). This system was used to monitor

intracellular pH following internalization into RAW cells and its potential for imaging pH in small animal models was demonstrated (109). Although much recent work has focused on development of ion-selective probes speciﬁc for Ca2+ , Zn2+ , and H+ , many probes for other bio-relevant analytes have been developed. Ratiometric ﬂuorescent indicators based different-sized crown ether ion chelators have been reported for Na+ (SBFI, Kd = 3.8 mM) (110) and K+ (PBFI, Kd = 5.1 mM) (110, 111), although they have relatively poor ion selectivity. Due to the potential role of unregulated cellular copper, in various diseases from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (112) to Alzheimer’s disease (113), ﬂuorogenic copper speciﬁc probes have been designed (114–116). Additional efforts have focused on preparation of iron selective probes, but only a few turn-on sensors have been reported (117–120) and their ability for live cell imaging remains relatively untested.
3.3. ROS Sensing

There is signiﬁcant interest in detection of reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in biology. These reactive compounds are involved in multiple signal transduction and

36

Hilderbrand

regulatory processes. Furthermore, many of these compounds are strong oxidants and play critical roles in host defense and, when unregulated, in disease progression. One of the key challenges is the development of sensors with a high degree of speciﬁcity for a single analyte. This is often difﬁcult since many of these species exhibit similar behavior as oxidants. Without selective sensors, it is very difﬁcult to study the function of a single ROS/RNS since many different species are present simultaneously in the same biological systems. The inability to differentiate between speciﬁc reactive species has been the primary ﬂaw of early probes such as 2 ,7 -dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein (DCFH), which shows broad non-speciﬁc activation to a variety of oxidant species (121). In addition to this lack of selectivity, DCFH displays marked autoxidation activity when exposed to light. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the ﬁrst reactive species for which selective ﬂuorogenic sensors were developed. There are many approaches to imaging NO, and a more complete summary is given elsewhere (122, 123). The most common strategy today for design of selective NO sensors is based on the o-phenylenediamine functional group. In the presence of dioxygen and NO, a selective reaction occurs to convert the o-diamine into a triazole derivative (Fig. 2.11a). This effectively results in an increase in ﬂuorescence signal since the amine groups of the o-phenylenediamine group, which are good photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenchers, are converted into an electron deﬁcient triazole. This approach has been used for design of a variety of NO sensors using naphthalene (124), ﬂuorescein (125), BODIPY (126), rhodamine (127), and carbocyanine (128) ﬂuorophores spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the blue to NIR. In general, these probes show excellent selectivity for NO in aerobic environments with little or no observed reactivity to other oxidants such as peroxynitrite (ONOO– ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), or superoxide radical (O2 – ) (125). Although useful in most imaging applications, these sensors do not directly monitor NO. Fluorogenic sensors for NO based on the o-phenylenediamine functional group only react with RNS formed by the pre reaction of NO with O2 . Therefore detection is dependent not only on the presence of NO but also local O2 levels. A preferred tactic is ﬂuorogenic sensors that are capable of direct reaction with NO. Recently the ﬁrst probes suitable for live cell imaging based on direct detection of NO were reported (129). These sensors consist of a Cu(II) complex with a modiﬁed ﬂuorescein derivative bearing an 8-aminoquinaldine chelating group (130). The paramagnetic properties of the Cu(II) coordinated to the ﬂuorescein probe result in quenched ﬂuorescence emission in the absence of NO. Reaction of this probe, CuFL, with NO results in reduction of the Cu(II) to Cu(I),

release of the Cu(I) ion, formation of a nitrosamine modiﬁed ﬂuorophore, and a strong increase in ﬂuorescence emission (Fig. 2.11b) (130). CuFL shows a greater than tenfold increase in ﬂuorescence upon combination with NO and like the ophenylenediamine based probes has excellent selectivity, with minimal side reactivity to ONOO– (130). There are many approaches for development of selective probes for H2 O2 . One strategy relies on the cleavage of sulfonateprotected ﬂuorescein (Fig. 2.11c) (131, 132) or naphthoﬂuorescein (133) scaffolds. However, these probes typically have nontrivial side reactivity with several oxidants such as O2 – , OH , or hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (131, 133). In an alternative approach, chemospeciﬁc probes for H2 O2 have been reported based on the speciﬁc chemical reaction of H2 O2 with boronate esters to give phenol species (Fig. 2.11d) (134). This detection strategy has been used to prepare ﬂuorogenic xanthene and resoruﬁn derivatives with either one or two reactive boronate esters (134–136). As a result of their non-polar composition, the sensors have innate cell permeability and depending on the ﬂuorophore scaffold emit in the blue (135), green (134, 136), or red (135–137). The boronate ester-based H2 O2 sensors show a dramatic ﬂuorescence response; in the case of the ﬂuorescein-based probe PF1, a >500-fold increase in ﬂuorescence signal is observed

38

upon reaction with H2 O2 (134). The diboronate ester modiﬁed probes are somewhat less sensitive than the monoboronate modiﬁed probes and are more suitable for monitoring H2 O2 under conditions of oxidative stress. The more sensitive monoboronate modiﬁed sensors PG1 and PC1 were used recently to visualize physiological signaling concentrations of H2 O2 in live cells (136). In addition to the more common ﬂuorescence based signaling mechanisms, a selective chemiluminescence based H2 O2 detection scheme has been reported (138). In this system, a chemoselective reaction occurs between H2 O2 and peroxylate ester polymeric nanoparticles generating high-energy dioxetanedione intermediates, which in turn chemically excite polycyclic aromatic ﬂuorophores embedded in the nanoparticles. Hypochlorous acid is an important strong oxidant involved in host defense and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease states. In biology, it is produced by the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), which converts H2 O2 and Cl– ions into HOCl. Few probes have been developed that are capable of selective detection of this important cellular oxidant. The ﬁrst reported sensor capable of efﬁcient HOCl detection is aminophenyl ﬂuorescein (APF) (121). APF shows excellent response to HOCl, generating ﬂuorescein as a ﬁnal oxidation product and displays several 100-fold ﬂuorescence activation (Fig. 2.11e). However, it also shows signiﬁcant cross reactivity with ONOO– and OH (121). This lack of speciﬁcity can be overcome when APF is used in conjunction with the chemically related HPF, which only reacts with ONOO– and OH (121). The selectivity of this system has been further tuned by careful selection of the ﬂuorophore scaffold. Using the same p-aminophenylether reactive group, the sulfonaphthoﬂuorescein based probe (SNAPF) displays enhanced ROS selectivity (Fig. 2.11f). SNAPF is activated exclusively by HOCl and has been used to monitor MPO generated HOCl in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo (139). Although it does react speciﬁcally with HOCl, the SNAPF probe is still not ideal as it only shows an approximately tenfold ﬂuorescence response when exposed to HOCl (139). Continued efforts in this ﬁeld will undoubtedly yield improved probes for selective detection of HOCl. In addition to efforts for preparation of selective probes for reactive small molecules such as NO, H2 O2 , and HOCl, sensors for several other species have been designed. Of these, there are few ﬂuorogenic probes speciﬁc for OH or O2 – . However, recently a new class of carbocyanine dyes, the hydrocyanines, has been reported that is sensitive to both superoxide and hydroxy radicals (140). These probes are prepared from conventional carbocyanine ﬂuorophores via selective reduction. When the reduced carbocyanines are exposed to ROS, they are oxidized back to their parent carbocyanine ﬂuorophore. Peroxynitrite responsive

39

probes have also been reported. These sensors only show a seven- to eightfold activation for ONOO– and have marked side reactivity with other ROS such as OH , with an observed threefold activation (141). Nevertheless, there is promise for development of more selective peroxynitrite sensors based on this activation scheme. Although less active than the invesitgation of ROS or RNS, there is interest the bioimaging of thiols. Imaging of thiols can give insight into local redox status. Furthermore, the presence of thiol containing amino acids such as homocysteine have been associated with a variety of disease states (142, 143). To this end, there have been several recent reports of ﬂuorogenic and ratiometric probes for thiol bioimaging (144–147).

4. Summary
There are many ﬂuorescence-based imaging agents for biological targets, enzymes, and other analytes. Targeted ﬂuorescent labels utilizing afﬁnity groups from antibodies to small molecules have been developed and many activatable sensors for metal ions from calcium to zinc have been designed. In addition, there are several different classes of activatable imaging agents for the detection of enzyme activity and reactive small molecules. As a result of the large pool of potential imaging agent choices, it can often be difﬁcult to select the most appropriate imaging agent for a particular experiment. The ability to identify an effective ﬂuorescent reporter can be facilitated by careful consideration of factors such as the conjugation chemistry, photophysical characteristics, polarity, cost, and selectivity of the imaging agent.
