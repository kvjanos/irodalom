Abstract

This chapter describes the development and implementation of three independent imaging assays for the major mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling modules: p38, JNK, and ERK. There are more than 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome that share an ATP‚Äêbinding site and catalytic domain conserved in both sequence and structure. The majority of kinase inhibitors have been found to be competitive with ATP, raising concerns regarding kinase selectivity and potency in an environment of millimolar intracellular concentrations of ATP, as well as the potential for off‚Äêtarget effects via the many other cellular proteins that bind and/or utilize ATP. The apparent redundancy of the kinase isoforms and functions in the MAPK signaling modules present additional challenges for kinase

inhibitor selectivity and potency. Imaging assays provide a method to address many of these concerns. Cellular imaging approaches facilitate analysis of the targets expressed in the context of their endogenous substrates and scaffolding proteins and in a complex environment for which subcellular localization, cross talk between pathways, phosphatase regulatory control, and intracellular ATP concentrations are relevant to the functions of the kinase. The assays described herein provide a strategy to proÔ¨Åle kinase inhibitors for MAPK pathway selectivity while simultaneously providing information on cell morphology or toxicity. Results suggest that the MAPK pathways are indeed susceptible to nonselective kinase inhibitors such as staurosporin and inhibitors that inhibit upstream MAPK Kinase Kinases (MKKKs) and MAPK Kinases (MKKs) in the MAPK signaling pathway, especially those involved in cross talk between the pathways. However, selective MAPK inhibitors were identiÔ¨Åed that exhibited pathway selectivity as evidenced by signiÔ¨Åcantly lower IC50 values for their respective p38, JNK, or ERK signaling pathway assays.
Introduction

There are more than 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome that share an ATP‚Äêbinding site catalytic domain that is conserved in both sequence and structure (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). Not surprisingly, the majority of kinase inhibitors identiÔ¨Åed to date interact within the ATP‚Äêbinding site and have been found to be competitive with ATP (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). The degree of conservation of the ATP‚Äêbinding site raises concerns over the ability to build selective inhibitors (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). Another signiÔ¨Åcant hurdle for ATP‚Äêcompetitive kinase inhibitors is their ability to exhibit potent activity in cellular environments where concentrations of ATP are reportedly in the millimolar range (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). In addition to kinases, numerous other cellular proteins bind and/or utilize ATP, each providing the potential for off‚Äêtarget binding of ATP‚Äêcompetitive kinase inhibitors leading to adverse effects (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). The emergence of automated cell‚Äêbased imaging assays has provided a powerful tool to interrogate the inhibition of kinases and signaling pathways in the cellular context (Almholt et al., 2004; Giuliano et al., 1997; Mitchison, 2005; Trask et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2006). Imaging assays may be conÔ¨Ågured to measure multiple kinase targets or signaling pathway readouts, thereby providing a selectivity proÔ¨Åle (Almholt et al., 2004; Giuliano et al., 1997; Mitchison, 2005) Image analysis algorithms also

provide multiple features and image‚Äêbased parameters that provide information on cell morphology and cytotoxicity (Giuliano et al., 1997). Thus, by mining ‚Äò‚Äòhigh‚Äêcontent‚Äô‚Äô data it is possible to extract additional information on the effects of compound treatment of cells beyond the single target readout typical of most other assay formats (Giuliano et al., 1997; Mitchison, 2005). Williams et al. (2006) and Trask et al. (2006) described the development and implementation of a mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinase‚Äêactivated protein kinase‚Äê2 (MK2) translocation assay to screen for inhibitors of the p38 mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This chapter describes the development of two additional imaging assays to identify inhibitors of extracellular signal‚Äêregulated kinases (ERK) and stress‚Äêactivated protein (c‚Äêjun N‚Äêterminal, JNK) mitogen‚Äêactivated signaling pathways. Furthermore, it describes the implementation of these three independent MAPK signal transduction pathway assays to assess the hits from a p38 inhibitor MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation screen (Trask et al., 2006) and to proÔ¨Åle compounds arising from two lead optimization efforts focused on the construction of selective p38 and JNK inhibitors.
Definition of the Cell Model

Mitogen‚Äêactivated protein kinases are members of the signaling cascades for diverse extracellular stimuli that regulate fundamental cellular processes, including embryogenesis, differentiation, mitosis, apoptosis, movement, and gene expression (Cowan and Storey, 2003; English and Cobb, 2002; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). Four distinct MAP kinase families have been described: extracellular signal‚Äêregulated kinases (ERKs), c‚Äêjun N‚Äêterminal (JNK) or stress‚Äê activated protein kinases (SAPK), ERK5/big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1), and the p38 group of protein kinases (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002; Ono and Han, 2000). MAP kinases phosphorylate other protein kinases, phospholipases, transcription factors, and cytoskeleton proteins (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). The core unit of a MAPK pathway is a three‚Äêmember protein kinase cascade (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). MAP kinases are regulated by phosphorylation and serve as substrates for MAPK kinases (MKKs). The third component of the phospho‚Äêrelay system are the MKKKs that phosphorylate and activate speciÔ¨Åc MKKs (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). SpeciÔ¨Åcity of MAPK responses is achieved by the activation of

[22]

distinct MKKK‚ÄêMKK‚ÄêMAPK signaling modules in response to different stimuli (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). The importance of MAPK signaling pathways as potential drug targets is indicated by the large number of patent applications that have been submitted by numerous pharmaceutical companies describing small molecule modulators of these pathways (English and Cobb, 2002; Fabbro et al., 2002; Noble et al., 2004; Regan et al., 2002). A number of small molecule inhibitors of the MAPK signaling modules have exhibited efÔ¨Åcacy in animal disease models, and several have advanced into human clinical trials for cancer and inÔ¨Çammation therapies (English and Cobb, 2002; Fabbro et al., 2002; Noble et al., 2004; Regan et al., 2002). The p38 (reactivating kinases, RKs, or p40) kinase module is known to mediate stress responses and is activated by heat shock, ultraviolet light, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, or the proinÔ¨Çammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‚Äê1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‚Äê (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Ono and Han, 2000). Activation of the p38 pathway results in the phosphorylation of downstream kinases, transcription and initiation factors that affect cell division, apoptosis, and invasiveness of cultured cells and the inÔ¨Çammatory response (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Ono and Han, 2000). In addition to p38a (CSBP, MPK2, RK, Mxi2), there are three p38 homologues: p38, p38 (ERK6, SAPK3), and p38 (SAPK4) (Ono and Han, 2000). p38 and p38 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas p38 is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, and p38 is enriched in lung, kidney, testis, pancreas, and small intestine (Ono and Han, 2000). Upstream kinases acting on p38 include MKK3 and MKK6, which in turn are activated by MLKs and ASK1 (MKKKs). The ERK MAPK module responds primarily to growth factors and mitogens by stimulating transcriptional responses involved in cell division, migration, and survival (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). ERK1 and ERK2 are widely expressed and are activated upstream by MEK1 and MEK2, which are in turn activated by Raf (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). The JNK MAPK module responds to a wide variety of stress signals, including heat shock, osmotic stress, proinÔ¨Çammatory cytokines, ischemia, and ultraviolet exposure (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). JNK1 and JNK2 are widely expressed in many tissues, whereas JNK3 is brain speciÔ¨Åc (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). JNK1 and JNK2 are activated upstream by MKK4 and MKK7, which are in

turn activated by a variety of MKKKs: MEKKs 1‚Äì4, ASK1, and MLKs (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). Thus, the MAPK signaling pathways are cascades composed of at least three kinases: MKKK‚ÄêMKK‚ÄêMAPK. This signaling cascade is exquisitely sensitive to regulatory input at multiple levels involving several mechanisms (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). On the basis of sequence homology and function, 12 members of the MAPK family have been identiÔ¨Åed together with 7 MKKs and 14 MKKKs (Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). The MKKKs are diverse in structure and have a variety of regulatory motifs not found in MKKs or MAPKs: pleckstrin homology domains, proline‚Äêrich sequences for binding Src‚Äêhomlogy domains, leucine‚Äêzipper dimerization sequences, and binding sites for GTP‚Äêbinding proteins (Garrington and Johnson, 1999). The diversity of regulatory domains in different MKKKs may provide the Ô¨Çexibility that allows the MAPK modules to respond to diverse stimuli. The MKK family has the fewest members in the MAPK module and has the highest speciÔ¨Åcity for their MAPK substrates (Garrington and Johnson, 1999). However, there is a considerable degree of cross talk between the MAPK modules that may be involved in modulating or Ô¨Åne‚Äê tuning the response to stimuli (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999). For example, each MKK can be phosphorylated by multiple MKKKs, and several MAPK substrates, such as Elk1 and MK3, can be phosphorylated by all three MAPK signaling pathways (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999). Given the apparent redundancy within MAPK signaling modules and cross talk between pathways, how then may speciÔ¨Åcity be achieved? One level of speciÔ¨Åcity may be provided at the level of cell/tissue speciÔ¨Åc and/or developmental expression patterns of the different isoforms that comprise the MAPK modules (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). Kinase activity can also be regulated by subcellular location, thus speciÔ¨Åcity and regulation of MAPK pathways may therefore be provided by scaffolding or anchoring proteins that bring together speciÔ¨Åc kinases for the selective activation, sequestration, and localization of signaling complexes (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002). Because MAPKs are regulated by phosphorylation, it therefore follows that phosphatases will be a key element of their control, and a family of dual speciÔ¨Åcity (Ser/Thr/ Tyr) MAPK phosphatases (MKP1, MKP2, and MKP3) has been implicated (Cowan and Storey, 2003). Imaging assays provide a means to investigate kinase targets in the intracellular milieu where these regulatory mechanisms are intact.

Cellomics ArrayScan Automated Imaging Platform

The ArrayScan platform marketed by Cellomics (Fisher ScientiÔ¨Åc, Hampton, NH) is one of the most widely deployed high‚Äêcontent screening (HCS) systems. The studies described in this chapter and in Williams et al. (2006) and Trask et al. (2006) are performed on an ArrayScan II that has the software upgraded to a 3.1 version. The ArrayScan 3.1 houses a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope outÔ¨Åtted with 5√Ç/0.25 NA, 10√Ç/0.3NA, and 20√Ç/0.4 NA Zeiss objectives. Illumination is provided by a Xe/Hg arc lamp source (EXFO, Quebec, Canada), and Ô¨Çuorescence is detected by a 12‚Äêbit high sensitivity √Ä20 ‚Äêcooled CCD camera (Photometrics Quantix). The ArrayScan 3.1 provides the capability of imaging multiple Ô¨Çuorescent probes by acquiring wavelength channels sequentially in which each Ô¨Çuorophore is excited separately and then collected through single‚Äê or multiband‚Äêpass Ô¨Ålter sets and detected on the chip of a monochromatic CCD camera. Channel selection is accomplished using a fast excitation Ô¨Ålter wheel combined with single or multiband emission Ô¨Ålter. The system comes with Ô¨Ålter sets designed for the common Ô¨Çuorescent probes and can distinguish up to four labels in a single preparation with minimal cross talk between channels. The ArrayScan 3.1 is a wide‚ÄêÔ¨Åeld imaging system that illuminates a ‚Äò‚Äòlarge‚Äô‚Äô area of the specimen and directly images that area all at once. It uses an image‚Äêbased autofocus system that images a Ô¨Çuorescent label in cells, typically Ô¨Çuorescently stained nuclei, but any feature of interest could be used, and an algorithm measures the relative sharpness of the image. It should be noted that any Ô¨Çuorescent particle could potentially be focused upon. The ArrayScan 3.1 was integrated with a Zymark Twister Robot and 80 plate stacker for Ô¨Åxed end point assays. The cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm developed by Cellomics may be used to quantify the relative distribution of a Ô¨Çuorescently tagged target between two cellular compartments, namely the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Giuliano et al., 1997). Labeling with a nucleic acid dye such as Hoechst 33342, DAPI, DRAQ5, or other Ô¨Çuorophore identiÔ¨Åes the nuclear region, and this signal is used to focus the instrument and to deÔ¨Åne a nuclear mask. The mask is eroded to reduce cytoplasmic contamination within the nuclear area, and the Ô¨Ånal reduced mask is used to quantify the amount of target channel Ô¨Çuorescence within the nucleus. The nuclear mask is then dilated to cover as much of the cytoplasmic region as possible without going outside the cell boundary. Removal of the original nuclear region from this dilated mask creates a ring mask that covers the cytoplasmic region outside the nuclear envelope. The ‚Äò‚ÄòCytonuc‚Äô‚Äô difference measurement is calculated as the difference of the average nuclear intensity minus the average cytoplasmic ring intensity on a per cell basis or may be reported as an overall well average value (Giuliano et al., 1997).

Development of the JNK MAPK Signaling Pathway Assay

To complement the p38 MAPK assay described elsewhere (Trask et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2006), we set out to develop a c‚ÄêJun activation assay leveraging a similar HCS approach. The c‚ÄêJun activation assay was developed in the HeLa adenocarcinoma cervical cell line (ATCC‚ÄêCCL2) using a commercially available screening kit (Hitkit) purchased from Cellomics. To conÔ¨Årm that the SAPK signaling pathway is intact in the HeLa cell line, cells are either left untreated or are treated with 100 nM of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin for 30 min. Cells are then solubilized in SDS sample buffer, their total cellular proteins are separated on 10% SDS‚Äê PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting blots are probed with speciÔ¨Åc antibodies for the total and phosphorylated forms of JNK1, JNK2, and c‚ÄêJun (Fig. 1A). The total JNK1, JNK2, and c‚ÄêJun signals detected on the Western blots appear unaffected by anisomycin treatment. However, activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway by anisomycin treatment dramatically increases the phosphorylation signals for JNK1, JNK2, and c‚ÄêJun relative to untreated controls (Fig. 1A). The c‚ÄêJun activation kit from Cellomics utilizes a combination of a primary mouse monoclonal antibody to phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun (Ser 63) and an Alexa 488‚Äêconjugated goat anti‚Äêmouse IgG secondary antibody to measure the amount of phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun in cells by indirect immunoÔ¨Çuorescence. HeLa cells (5 √Ç 103) per well were seeded in EMEM √æ 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L‚Äêglutamine and were incubated overnight at 37 and 5% CO2. Medium, with or without 100 nM anisomycin, was added and the plates were incubated at 37 and 5% CO2 for 25 min. The cells were Ô¨Åxed with formaldehyde, permeabilized, incubated with the primary mouse antibody against phoshorylated c‚ÄêJun, washed, and then incubated with the goat anti‚Äêmouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 containing Hoechst dye. The Cellomics ArrayScan 3.1 is used to capture images of the phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun in Ô¨Åelds of view of untreated and anisomycin‚Äêtreated HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). The level of phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun Ô¨Çuorescent signal is signiÔ¨Åcantly brighter in anisomycin‚Äêtreated cells than in untreated cells, and the majority of the staining of both populations appears localized within the nucleus. Labeling nuclei with Hoechst 33342 identiÔ¨Åes the nuclear region, and this signal is used to focus the instrument and in deÔ¨Åning a nuclear mask. The cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm measures the relative distribution of the target, in this case c‚ÄêJun, between two cellular compartments, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Bit maps of individual cells, from both nuclear and c‚ÄêJun channels for untreated and treated cells, are also shown (Fig. 1B). As determined by the algorithm, the nuclear masks are indicated in blue and the cytoplasmic ring masks are indicated in green. While the

nuclear staining appears equivalent in both cells, the phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun Ô¨Çuorescent signal is signiÔ¨Åcantly brighter in the nuclear region of the anisomycin‚Äê treated cell than in the untreated cell. The ‚Äò‚ÄòCytonuc‚Äô‚Äô difference (average nuclear intensity ‚Äì average cytoplasmic ring intensity) for c‚ÄêJun staining will therefore be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in anisomycin‚Äêtreated cells. A series of experiments was conducted to optimize the c‚ÄêJun activation assay and to provide a robust and reproducible readout of the JNK/SAPK pathway activation (Figs. 2 and 3). To evaluate the c‚ÄêJun activation responses of HeLa cells, several stimuli were examined in dose‚Äìresponse experiments: IL‚Äê1, platelet‚Äêderived growth factor, phorbol ester (PMA), and anisomycin (Fig. 2A). Even though anisomycin, IL‚Äê1, and PMA all produce dose‚Äêdependent c‚ÄêJun activation responses, anisomycin was selected for further assay development, as it exhibits the largest signal window. Cell density effects were examined as follows: 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 √Ç 103 HeLa cells per well are seeded in EMEM √æ 10% FBS and incubated overnight at 37 and 5% CO2. Medium, with or without 100 nM anisomycin, was added and the plates were incubated at 37 and 5% CO2 for 25 min. The ArrayScan imager and cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm are able to adequately quantify the c‚ÄêJun activation response at all three seeding densities (Fig. 2B). Data presented are the means from at least 250 valid objects (cells), or 10 Ô¨Åelds, whichever came Ô¨Årst. A seeding density of 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well was selected for further assay development to reduce both the cell culture demands for the assay and the number of Ô¨Åelds required to obtain a valid object count greater than 250 while maintaining good physical separation between cells. To identify the optimal stimulation time, HeLa cells were plated at 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well; after overnight culture, medium containing the indicated concentrations of anisomycin was added and plates were incubated for the indicated time points prior to Ô¨Åxation and staining (Fig. 2C).

The cells were Ô¨Åxed with formaldehyde, permeabilized, incubated with the primary mouse antibody against phosphorylated c‚ÄêJun, washed, and then incubated with the goat antimouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and containing Hoechst dye. The Cellomics ArrayScan 3.1 was used to capture images of the phospho‚Äêc‚ÄêJun in Ô¨Åelds of view of untreated and anisomycin‚Äêtreated HeLa cells. The cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm measures the relative distribution of the target, in this case c‚ÄêJun, between two cellular compartments, the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

The c‚ÄêJun activation dose responses of Hela cells treated with the indicated doses of interleukin‚Äê1 (IL‚Äê1), platelet‚Äêderived growth factor (PDGH), or phorbol ester (PMA) were compared to anisomycin‚Äêinduced responses quantiÔ¨Åed by the cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm from images captured on the ArrayScan.

treatment after 10 min of incubation, at least 20 min is required for a maximal response. The response appears stable between 20 and 60 min, and a 30‚Äêmin incubation period was selected for further assay development. Finally, compound screening libraries are typically solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and we wanted to evaluate the DMSO tolerance of the c‚ÄêJun activation response in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were plated at 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well and after overnight culture, were treated for 30 min with media or 100ng/mL anisomycin at the indicated DMSO concentrations (Fig. 2D). The c‚ÄêJun activation response appears unaffected at DMSO concentrations 1.0%. However, at DMSO concentrations >1.0%, the Cytonuc difference increases with the DMSO concentration, independently of the treatment conditions. We therefore decided that for the c‚ÄêJun activation assay, compounds would be diluted such that DMSO concentrations would not exceed 1.0%. Having completed these assay development experiments enabled us to Ô¨Ånalize a c‚ÄêJun activation protocol.

c‚ÄêJun Activation Signal Window and Reproducibility

To evaluate the reproducibility of the c‚ÄêJun activation response in HeLa cells, cells were plated at 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well and on the following day are treated with the indicated doses of anisomycin in three independent experiments run on separate days (Fig. 3A). The EC50 for anisomycin‚Äê induced c‚ÄêJun activation ranged from 52 to 114 nM and produced on

average an EC50 of 87 √Ü 32 nm, indicating a reproducible assay. To evaluate the ability of the c‚ÄêJun activation response in HeLa cells to identify SAPK pathway inhibitors, cells were plated and on the next day the indicated doses of the JNK 1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 were added simultaneously with 100 ng/ml anisomycin (Ô¨Ånal) and cells were incubated for 30 min (Fig. 3B). In three independent experiments, the IC50 for the JNK 1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 ranged from 3.0 to 5.7 M and produced on average an IC50 of 4.77 √Ü 1.51 M. To further evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the c‚ÄêJun activation response in HeLa cells, two full 96‚Äêwell plates were treated under the following conditions, one plate per condition: medium alone (blue squares) and 100 ng/ml anisomycin (green circles) (Fig. 3C). In addition to the population scatter plot, plate heat map views of the two plates are also presented (Fig. 3D). The average Cytonuc difference for the medium control plate was 356, and the average Cytonuc difference for the anisomycin‚Äêtreated control plate was 1580, producing an average assay signal to background window of 4.4‚Äêfold. A comparison of medium control plate variability data to anisomycin‚Äêtreated plate variability data produced a Z factor of 0.77, indicating that the assay would deÔ¨Ånitely be compatible with HTS (Zhang et al., 1999).
Development of the ERK MAPK Signaling Pathway Assay

To complement our p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathway HCS assays, an ERK activation assay was developed in the HeLa adenocarcinoma cervical cell line (ATCC‚ÄêCCL2) using antiphospho‚Äêp44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) antibodies. To conÔ¨Årm that the ERK signaling pathway is intact in the HeLa cell line, cells were left untreated or were treated with either 10 ng/ml oncostatin M (OSM) or 50 ng/ml PMA for 6 min. Cells were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer, their cellular proteins separated on 10% SDS‚ÄêPAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting blot was probed with speciÔ¨Åc antibodies for the total and phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 4A). The total ERK1 and ERK2 signals detected on the Western blots appear unaffected by OSM and PMA treatment. However, activation of the ERK signaling pathway by both OSM and PMA treatment dramatically increases the phosphorylation signals for ERK1 and ERK2 relative to untreated controls (Fig. 4A). The ERK activation imaging assay utilizes a combination of a primary polyclonal rabbit anti‚Äêphospho‚Äêp44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Try204) (ERK1/2) antibody purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies and an Alexa 488‚Äê conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody from Molecular Probes to measure the amount of phospho‚ÄêERK1/2 in cells by indirect immunoÔ¨Çuorescence (Fig. 4B). HeLa cells (5 √Ç 103) per well were seeded in DMEM

The Z factor was calculated according to the method of Zhang et al. (1999). (D) A plate heat map view of the two plates is also presented.

(A) HeLa cells were left untreated or were treated with either 10 ng/ml oncostatin M (OSM) or 50 ng/ml phorbol ester (PMA) for 6.0 min. Cells were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer, their total cellular proteins were separated on 10% SDS‚ÄêPAGE gels, and they were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting blots were probed with speciÔ¨Åc antibodies for the total and phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 .

The Cellomics ArrayScan 3.1 was used to capture images of

[22]

the phospho‚ÄêERK1/2 in Ô¨Åelds of view of untreated and OSM‚Äêtreated HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). In untreated HeLa cells, the phospho‚ÄêERK1/2 Ô¨Çuorescent signal is relatively dim and appears to be localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the level of phospho‚ÄêERK1/2 Ô¨Çuorescent signal is signiÔ¨Åcantly brighter in OSM‚Äêtreated cells, and the majority of the staining appears localized within the nucleus. The cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm measures the relative distribution of the target, in this case phospho‚ÄêERK1/2, between two cellular compartments, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The ‚Äò‚ÄòCytonuc‚Äô‚Äô difference (average nuclear intensity ‚Äê average cytoplasmic ring intensity) for phospho‚ÄêERK1/2 staining will therefore be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in OSM‚Äêtreated cells. A series of assay development experiments was conducted to optimize the ERK activation assay and provide a robust and reproducible readout of the ERK pathway activation (Figs. 5 and 6). Because the ERK MAPK module responds to a variety of growth factors and mitogens, a number of different stimuli were tested in the ERK1/2 activation assay: EGF, TNFa, PMA, OSM, and TGF (Fig. 5A). EGF, PMA, OSM, and TGF all induced robust dose‚Äêdependent ERK1/2 activation responses as quantiÔ¨Åed by the cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm from images captured on the ArrayScan (Fig. 5A). TNF treatment, however, only produced a weak activation of phospho‚ÄêErk1/2 when measured on the ArrayScan. OSM and PMA are the stimuli selected for further assay development. To evaluate the effects of seeding density, HeLa cells were seeded at a variety of densities between 2 and 10 √Ç 103 cells per well in DMEM √æ 0.5% FBS and are incubated overnight at 37 and 5% CO2. Medium, with or without the indicated doses of PMA, was added and the plates were incubated at 37 and 5% CO2 for 30 min (Fig. 5B). The ArrayScan imager and cytoplasm‚Äêto‚Äênuclear translocation algorithm are able to adequately quantify the ERK activation response at all six seeding densities (Fig. 5B). Data presented are the means from at least 250 valid objects (cells), or 10 Ô¨Åelds, whichever came Ô¨Årst. A seeding density of 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well was selected for further assay development to reduce both the cell culture demands for the assay and the number of Ô¨Åelds required to obtain a valid object count !250. To identify the optimal stimulation time, HeLa cells were plated 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well and, after overnight culture, medium containing either 10 ng/ml OSM or 50 ng/ml PMA was added and plates were incubated for the indicated time points prior to Ô¨Åxation and staining (Fig. 5C). The ERK activation induced by PMA or OSM treatment is relatively rapid and reaches a maximal response at 5 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 5C). With OSM treatment the maximal activation of ERK1/2 appears stable between 10 and 15 min post‚Äêtreatment and then declines to pre‚Äêstimulation levels in a roughly linear fashion over the next 45 min.

(C) HeLa cells (5.0 √Ç 103 ) per well were plated and, after overnight culture, medium containing either 10 ng/ml OSM or 50 ng/ml PMA was added and plates were incubated for the indicated time points prior to Ô¨Åxation and staining. (D) HeLa cells (5.0 √Ç 103 ) per well were plated and, after overnight culture, were treated with either 10 ng/ml OSM or 50 ng/ml PMA for 10 min at the indicated DMSO concentrations.

PMA treatment, the maximal activation of ERK1/2 appears stable between 5 and 20 min posttreatment and then declines to $50% of prestimulation levels in a roughly linear fashion over the next 40 min. A treatment period of 10 min was selected for further assay development with both OSM and PMA. Finally, because compound libraries are typically solubilized in DMSO, we wanted to evaluate the DMSO tolerance of the ERK activation

response. HeLa cells were plated 5.0 √Ç 103 cells per well and, after overnight culture, were treated with either 10 ng/ml OSM or 50 ng/ml PMA for 10 min at the indicated DMSO concentrations (Fig. 5D). The ERK activation response appears unaffected at DMSO concentrations 1.0%. At 5% DMSO there is an apparent increase in the Cytonuc difference for both OSM and PMA, but at 10% DMSO there are so few cells left in the wells that no values can be measured. We therefore decided that for the ERK activation assay, compounds would be diluted such that DMSO concentrations would not exceed 0.5%. Based on the results of these assay development experiments we were able to compose an ERK activation protocol.

ERK1/2 Activation Signal Window and Reproducibility

To evaluate the reproducibility of the ERK activation response in HeLa cells, cells were plated and on the following day are treated with the indicated doses of OSM or PMA in three independent experiments run on separate days (Fig. 6A and B). The EC50 for OSM‚Äêinduced ERK activation ranges from 0.1 to 0.22 ng/ml and produces on average an EC50 of 0.169 √Ü 0.062 ng/ml, indicating a reproducible assay (Fig. 6A). The EC50 for PMA‚Äêinduced ERK activation ranges from 0.81 to 0.95 ng/ml and produces, on average, an EC50 of 0.884 √Ü 0.068 ng/ml, indicating a reproducible assay (Fig. 6B). To evaluate the ability of the ERK activation response in HeLa cells to identify ERK pathway inhibitors, cells were plated and on the next day the indicated doses of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were added 15 min prior to the addition

of 10 ng/ml OSM and cells were incubated for an additional 10 min (Fig. 6C). In three independent experiments, the IC50 for the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 ranged from 0.489 to 0.711 M and produced, on average, an IC50 of 0.616 √Ü 0.115 M. To further evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of the ERK activation response in HeLa cells, three full 96‚Äêwell plates were treated under the following conditions, one plate per condition: medium alone (green circles), 10 ng/ml OSM (red triangles), and 10 ng/ml OSM √æ 10 M staurosporin (blue squares)(Fig. 6D). The average Cytonuc difference for the media control plate was 71, and the average Cytonuc difference for the anisomycin‚Äêtreated control plate was 177, producing an average assay signal‚Äêto‚Äêbackground window of 2.49‚Äêfold. A comparison of medium control plate variability data to anisomycin‚Äêtreated plate variability data produced a Z factor of 0.54, indicating that the assay would be compatible with HTS (Zhang et al., 1999).
MAPK Pathway Inhibitor Test Cassette

To evaluate the three independent MAPK signaling pathway imaging assays that we had developed and to determine their ability to discriminate selectivity proÔ¨Åles across the MAPK family, we assembled a test cassette of known MAPK pathway inhibitors (Table I). In addition to Ô¨Åve ‚Äò‚Äòselective‚Äô‚Äô p38 inhibitors, we included the JNK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor SP 600125, the MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitors UO126 and PD 98059, the PI3‚Äêkinase inhibitor wortmannin, and staurosporin as a nonselective kinase inhibitor. We also selected two activation stimuli for each MAPK pathway assay: anisomycin and TNF for the p38 pathway, anisomycin and IL‚Äê1 for the JNK pathway, and OSM and PMA for the ERK pathway (Table I). All Ô¨Åve p38 inhibitors produced IC50 values for inhibition of anisomycin‚Äê and TNF‚Äêinduced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation <100 nM. UO126 and PD 98059, the MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitors, produced IC50 values in the 20 to 39 M range for both activating stimuli, whereas the nonselective kinase inhibitor staurosporin produced submicromolar IC50 values for both stimuli (Table I). Neither the PI3‚Äêkinase inhibitor wortmannin nor the JNK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 inhibited anisomycin‚Äê or TNF‚Äêinduced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation. Overall, the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay appears exquisitively sensitive to p38 inhibitors relative to other kinase inhibitors. In the c‚ÄêJun activation assay, the JNK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 and staurosporin produced IC50 values of 8.6 and 1.4 M, respectively, with IL‚Äê1√ü as the stimulus , and IC50 values of 14 and 7.2 M, respectively, with anisomycin as the stimulus (Table I). Three of the Ô¨Åve ‚Äò‚Äòselective‚Äô‚Äô p38 inhibitors, the Merck p38 inhibitor, RWJ 68354, and SB203580, produced IC50 values between 20 and 40 M with anisomycin as the activating stimulus, whereas only the Merck

p38 inhibitor and RWJ 68354 inhibited c‚ÄêJun activation by IL‚Äê1√ü. Two of the Ô¨Åve ‚Äò‚Äòselective‚Äô‚Äô p38 inhibitors, VX‚Äê745 and SB242235, did not inhibit c‚ÄêJun activation by either stimulus. Neither of the MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitors UO126 and PD 98059 nor the PI3‚Äêkinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited c‚ÄêJun activation by anisomycin, although U0126 inhibited IL‚Äê1√ü‚Äêinduced activation (Table I). Clearly the c‚ÄêJun activation assay was inhibited by the JNK‚Äê1/2 kinase inhibitor; however, it was also susceptible to three of the Ô¨Åve p38 inhibitors, albeit at >100‚Äêfold less sensitivity that the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation p38 MAPK pathway assay. The MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor U0126 produced IC50 values in the 1 to 7 M range for both ERK activation stimuli, whereas the nonselective kinase inhibitor staurosporin produced nanomolar IC50 values for both stimuli, and the Merck p38 inhibitor produced IC50 values in the 11 to 12 M range for both stimuli (Table II). SB203580 produced an IC50 of 26 M with PMA as the activating stimulus, but failed to inhibit OSM‚Äêinduced ERK activation. None of the other compounds inhibited ERK activation by either stimulus: the MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor PD 98059, three of the ‚Äò‚Äòselective‚Äô‚Äô p38 inhibitors, VX‚Äê745, RWJ 68354, and SB242235, the PI3‚Äêkinase inhibitor wortmannin, and the JNK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 (Table I). The ERK activation assay was the least susceptible to inhibition by compounds that are reportedly selective for the other MAPK signaling pathways (Table I). Staurosporin is a potent inhibitor of numerous kinases in vitro that is active in many cell‚Äêbased assays. The ability of staurosporin to inhibit all three MAPK signaling pathways assays (Table I) is likely due to its ability to bind to the ATP‚Äêbinding sites of multiple kinases in these pathways. The Merck p38 inhibitor also produced IC50 values in all three assays, but the ability to inhibit the JNK and ERK signaling pathways (Table I) was likely due to the apparent cytotoxicity, or signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced adherence of the HeLa cells, observed at the two highest concentrations of the compound (Williams et al., 2006). Images revealed that there were much fewer cells in the Ô¨Åelds of view captured from wells treated with 50 and 16.6 M of the Merck p38 inhibitor compared to the 5.5 M dose, which produced obvious outliers in several cell number and morphology parameters derived by the image analysis algorithm (Williams et al., 2006). The high‚Äêcontent nature of image‚Äêderived data therefore provides additional information that may be a consequence of target inhibition or may be due to off‚Äêtarget effects of the compound. The Merck p38 inhibitor produced an IC50 $ 7‚Äì10 nM in the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation p38 MAPK pathway assay and IC50 values of 20 and 10 M in the JNK and ERK signaling pathway assays, respectively. A number of the p38 inhibitors, including the Merck p38 inhibitor, have been withdrawn from clinical trials because of adverse toxicity proÔ¨Åles (English and Cobb, 2002; Fabbro et al., 2002; Noble et al., 2004; Regan et al., 2002).

In contrast to staurosporin and the Merck p38 MAPK inhibitor, the PI3‚Äêkinase inhibitor wortmannin did not inhibit any of the three MAPK signaling pathway assays (Table I), and the JNK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 only inhibited the c‚ÄêJun activation assay, perhaps indicating some degree of MAPK pathway selectivity (Table I). The MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor UO126 produced IC50 values ranging between 1.2 and 6.9 M in the ERK activation assay and an IC50 of 44 M in the IL‚Äê1‚Äêinduced c‚ÄêJun activation assay. In contrast, the MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 did not inhibit either the c‚ÄêJun or the ERK activation assay. The MEK‚Äê1/2 inhibitors UO126 and PD 98059 produced IC50 values ranging between 25 and 39 M in the MK2‚Äê EGFP translocation p38 MAPK assay, perhaps indicating that ERK1/2 may be capable of phosphorylating MK2 as well as MK1 or perhaps reÔ¨Çecting the cross talk between the different modules of MAPK signaling pathways (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999). All Ô¨Åve p38 inhibitors produced IC50 values for inhibition of anisomycin‚Äê and TNF‚Äêinduced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation <200 nM (Table I). As discussed

413

earlier, the Merck p38 inhibitor also inhibited the c‚ÄêJun and ERK activation assays with IC50 values of 20 and 10 M, respectively, likely due to the apparent cytotoxicity at these concentrations interfering with the image analysis algorithm. The RWJ 68354 p38 inhibitor inhibited anisomycin‚Äê and TNF‚Äêinduced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation with IC50 values between 74 and 87 nM and the c‚ÄêJun activation assay with IC50 values between 20 and 38 M. The SB203580 p38 inhibitor inhibited anisomycin‚Äê and TNF‚Äê induced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation with IC50 values between 53 and 220 nM and the c‚ÄêJun and ERK activation assays with IC50 values of 41 and 26 M, respectively. In general, therefore, selective MAPK inhibitors exhibited pathway selectivity by producing signiÔ¨Åcantly lower IC50 values for their respective ERK, JNK, or p38 signaling pathway assays. However, each of the MAPK pathways assays was also susceptible to nonselective kinase inhibitors such as staurosporin and inhibitors that inhibit upstream MKKKs and MKKs in the MAPK signaling pathway, especially those involved in the cross talk between different modules of the MAPK signaling pathways.
p38 Inhibitor Hit Assessment

Williams et al. (2006) and Trask et al. (2006) described the development and optimization of the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay and the subsequent use of this assay to screen a 32K kinase biased library to identify p38 MAPK inhibitors. As part of the follow‚Äêup hit assessment for the screen, selected hits and related structural analogs were proÔ¨Åled in the three MAPK signaling pathway assays described here (Table II). Eleven of the 16 hits and related analogs produced an IC50 in the anisomycin‚Äêinduced MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay: 4 in the submicromolar range, 5 in the 1 to 10 M range, and 2 at $14 M (Table II). Five of the 16 hits and related analogs produced an IC50 in the anisomycin‚Äêinduced c‚ÄêJun activation assay: 3 in the 1 to 10 M range, 1 at $18 M, and 1 at 38 M (Table II). None of the 16 hits and related analogs produced an IC50 in the OSM‚Äêinduced ERK activation assay (Table II). Most of the hits produced signiÔ¨Åcantly lower IC50 values in the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay relative to the c‚ÄêJun activation assay, and 3 of the hit scaffolds identiÔ¨Åed in the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation HCS were selected for p38a inhibitor hit‚Äêto‚Äêlead chemistry structure activity relationship (SAR).

40 compounds directed at p38 inhibition. All 40 compounds produced IC50 values in the p38 cell‚Äêbased MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay: 29 in the submicromolar range, 10 in the 1 to 5 M range, and 1 at $21.7 M (Table III). Three of the 40 tested produced IC50 values in the cell‚Äêbased ERK activation assay: 3 in the 30 to 40 M range (Table III), suggesting little or no interference with the ERK MAPK pathway. In contrast, 22 of the 40 p38 inhibitors also inhibited the c‚ÄêJun activation assay, albeit with signiÔ¨Åcantly less potency than in the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay: 1 in the submicromolar range, 5 in the 1 to 10 M range, and 16 in the 10 to 40 M range (Table III). Although most of the compounds exhibited low nanomolar potency against p38 isoforms in vitro, a number of these compounds also exhibited submicromolar or low nanomolar potency against JNK isoforms in vitro (data not shown). In the majority of cases, however, despite exhibiting low to mid‚Äênanomolar potency in the MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation assay, these mixed p38‚ÄêJNK inhibitors typically only produced 5 to 30 M potencies in the c‚ÄêJun activation assay. Because all three MAPK pathway assays were performed in the HeLa cell background, it is unlikely that differential cell permeability is contributing to the apparent differences in cellular potencies between mixed p38‚ÄêJNK inhibitors with similar in vitro potencies. In general, the apparent MAPK selectivity proÔ¨Åle from the in vitro kinase assays was reÔ¨Çected in the cell‚Äêbased MAPK assays; however, the apparent p38 selectivity of the compounds was typically more pronounced in the cell‚Äêbased assays.
JNK Inhibitor Profiling

To further characterize the selectivity of the three MAPK signaling pathway assays, a set of 40 JNK inhibitors was assembled (Table IV). Twenty‚Äêthree of the 40 compounds produced IC50 values in the c‚ÄêJun activation cell‚Äêbased assay: 4 in the sub‚Äêmicromolar range, 3 in the 1 to 10 M range, and 16 in the 10 to 40 M range (Table IV). However, despite exhibiting potencies in the mid‚Äênanomolar or sub‚Äêmicromolar IC50 values in the JNK in vitro kinase assays (data not shown), with only four exceptions the compounds typically produced cellular activity in the 5 to 40 M range. Fifteen of the 40 tested also produced IC50 values in the cell‚Äêbased ERK activation assay: 3 in the 1 to 10 M range and 12 in the 10 to 40 M range (Table IV). The ERK MAPK module responds primarily to growth factors and mitogens and is involved in the regulation of cell division, migration, and survival (Cowan and Storey, 2003; Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002), and inhibition of this pathway may have an adverse effect that could impact the therapeutic index of these JNK inhibitors. Conversely, there appears to be relatively little interference of the p38 MAPK signaling

pathway by these JNK inhibitors, with only 10 of the 40 tested producing IC50 values in the cell‚Äêbased MK2‚ÄêEGFP translocation p38 assay: 1 in the 1 to 10 M range and 9 in the 10 to 40 M range (Table IV).
Discussion

This chapter and ones by Williams et al. (2006) and Trask et al. (2006) described the development and implementation of the three distinct high‚Äê content cell‚Äêbased MAPK signaling pathway assays to proÔ¨Åle kinase inhibitors for MAPK module selectivity. The apparent redundancy of the kinase isoforms and functions in the MAPK signaling modules presents a challenge for kinase inhibitor selectivity and potency. For ATP‚Äêcompetitive inhibitors, these selectivity concerns may be exacerbated further by the degree of conservation of the ATP‚Äêbinding site within the kinase family, the millimolar intracellular concentrations of ATP that may signiÔ¨Åcantly affect cellular potency, and the potential for off‚Äêtarget effects due to binding to many other cellular proteins that bind and/or utilize ATP (English and Cobb, 2002; Noble et al., 2004). The development of imaging assays for the major MAPK signaling modules, p38, JNK, and ERK, provided a strategy to proÔ¨Åle kinase inhibitors for signaling pathway selectivity while simultaneously measuring effects on cell morphology or toxicity end points. These assays provided a mechanism to screen kinase inhibitors against targets that were expressed in the context of their endogenous substrates and scaffolding proteins in the appropriate cellular localization and that had to perform their functions in a complex environment involving cross talk between signaling pathways, phosphatase regulatory control, and intracellular ATP concentrations. The MAPK pathways assays were susceptible to nonselective kinase inhibitors such as staurosporin and inhibitors that inhibit upstream MKKKs and MKKs in the MAPK signaling pathway, especially those involved in cross talk between the pathways. In general, however, selective MAPK inhibitors exhibited pathway selectivity as evidenced by signiÔ¨Åcantly lower IC50 values for their respective p38, JNK, or ERK signaling pathway assays.
