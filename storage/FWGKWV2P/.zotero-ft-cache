Quantitating	responses	of	subpopulations	in	cellular	 assays	using	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	1000	Multi	Target	 Analysis	Module
Key words: multiplex • classification • apoptosis • subpopulations • cell cycle • IN Cell Analyzer
Cultured	cell	populations	rarely	behave	in	synchrony,	yet	 many	high-content	analysis	routines	are	designed	to	extract	 measurements	that	are	averaged	over	the	entire	population.	 New	analysis	modules	for	the	IN	Cell	Analysis	platforms	extract	 multiparametric	measurements	from	each	cell	and	employ	 advanced	hierarchical	classification	tools	to	assign	cells	to	 user-defined	subpopulations.	The	percentage	of	cells	in	each	 subpopulation	is	then	reported	together	with	the	multiparametric	 data	associated	with	cells	in	each	class.	 The	Multi	Target	Analysis	Module	for	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	1000	 has	been	developed	to	analyze	complex	multicolor	cell	based	 assays	with	user-defined	classification	strategies.	The	module	 utilizes	multidimensional	graphical	displays	to	visualize	 characteristics	of	cells	within	a	population,	whilst	interactive	 filters	permit	the	definition	of	subpopulations.	The	module	 allows	the	analysis	of	several	object	types	including	three	 organelles	and	two	reference	features	and	reports	a	wide	 range	of	intensity	and	morphology	based	output	measures.	 Importantly,	the	module	allows	the	user	to	build	complex	 hierarchical	classification	systems	by	linking	multiple	 subpopulation	analyses.	 This	application	note	demonstrates	the	utility	of	the	Multi	Target	 Analysis	Module	in	the	visualization,	definition,	and	analysis	of	 subpopulations	present	in	complex,	multicolor,	live	and	fixed	 cellular	assays.	The	effects	of	compounds	upon	cellular	integrity	 and	viability	have	been	assessed	using	combinations	of	the	 fluorescent	indicators;	calcein	AM,	propidium	iodide	(PI)	and	 FITC-Annexin	V.	Whilst	the	effects	of	cell	cycle	inhibitors	have	 been	assessed	using	combinations	of	Hoechst™	33342,	G1S	 Cell	Cycle	Phase	Marker	(G1S	CCPM)	or	G2M	Cell	Cycle	Phase	 Marker	(G2M	CCPM)	sensors,	and	the	immunofluorescent	 detection	of	bromodeoxyuridine	(BrdU)	incorporation.

U-2	OS	cells	were	exposed	to	ionomycin	for	4	h	or	vinblastine	 or	paclitaxel	for	24	h.	Complete	medium	containing	Hoechst	 33342,	FITC-Annexin	V,	and	PI	was	added	(to	final	concentrations	 of	10	µM,	1:1000,	and	5	µM	respectively)	and	incubated	for	 10	min	at	25°C.	Images	were	acquired	on	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	 1000	using	a	10×	objective	and	360/40-nm	excitation	and	 460/40-nm	emission	filters	with	1000-ms	exposure	for	Hoechst	 33342;	475/20-nm	excitation	and	535/50-nm	emission	filters	 with	800-ms	exposure	for	FITC-Annexin	V;	570/20-nm	excitation	 and	620/60-nm	emission	filters	with	200-ms	exposure	for	PI.	 A	hallmark	of	apoptotic	and	necrotic	cell	death	is	the	 translocation	of	phosphatidylserine	(PS)	to	the	outer	leaflet	of	 the	plasma	membrane	(1).	The	exposure	of	PS	can	be	detected	 using	a	fluorescently	labeled	annexin	V	conjugate,	which	when	 used	in	combination	with	PI	enables	the	discrimination	of	 apoptotic	and	dead	cells.	All	cells	were	identified	by	Hoechst	 33342	nuclear	staining.	Apoptotic	cells	expose	PS	early	in	 the	process	and	therefore	exhibit	additional	FITC-Annexin	V	 fluorescence,	which	can	occur	anywhere	within	the	cell	 boundary.	For	dead	cells,	PS	exposure	occurs	later	once	cells	 have	lost	membrane	integrity	and	therefore	these	cells	exhibit	 cellular	fluorescence	due	to	FITC-Annexin	V	and	also	nuclear	 fluorescence	due	to	PI	staining. Note: Cell viability and apoptosis are live-cell assays; removal of culture medium from wells or fixation of cells after treatment with test compounds should be avoided since dead, necrotic, and poorly attached cells will be detached by this process.

Methods and analysis
Cells	in	log-phase	growth	were	seeded	into	96-well	microplates	 (5000	cells	per	well)	and	incubated	in	culture	medium	for	24	h	 at	37°C,	5%	CO2.	Culture	medium	was	removed	from	the	cells	 and	replaced	with	culture	medium	(100	µl)	containing	test	 compounds	(n	=	8)	and	incubated	at	37°C,	5%	CO2.	Images	 were	analyzed	directly	using	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	1000	Multi	 Target	Analysis	Module.	Hoechst	33342	emits	fluorescence	 when	bound	to	DNA	and	was	used	to	identify	and	segment	 nuclei	as	objects.	Where	appropriate,	additional	cellular	 compartments	were	segmented	to	enable	the	classification	 of	individual	cells	into	subpopulations	based	on	the	relative	 fluorescence	intensity	and	localization	of	appropriate	reporters.	 The	analysis	module	was	configured	to	report	the	number	 and	percentage	of	cells	in	each	subpopulation	together	with	 the	multiparametric	data	associated	with	cells	in	each	class.

G1S CCPM Assay
G1S	CCPM	cells	were	exposed	to	roscovitine	for	24	h	or	 nocodazole	for	16	h.	Cells	were	incubated	with	BrdU	(1:500)	 for	1	h	prior	to	fixation	and	staining	with	Hoechst	33342	 (2	µM).	BrdU	was	detected	using	anti-BrdU	primary	antibody	 and	Cy™5	labeled	secondary	antibody	(Cell	Proliferation	 Fluorescence	Assay).	Images	were	acquired	using	360/40nm	excitation	and	460/40-nm	emission	filters	with	750-ms	 exposure	for	Hoechst	33342;	475/20-nm	excitation	and	 535/50-nm	emission	filters	with	1000-ms	exposure	for	GFP;	 620/60-nm	excitation	and	700/75-nm	emission	filters	with	 400-ms	exposure	for	Cy5.	 Cells	undergoing	DNA	replication	(S-phase)	incorporate	 BrdU	and	are	therefore	labeled	using	the	Cell	Proliferation	 Fluorescence	Assay	and	exhibit	an	increased	Cy5	nucleus: cell	intensity	ratio.	The	phenotype	of	G2-phase	cells	shows	the	 G1S	CCPM	sensor	to	be	mainly	expressed	in	the	cytoplasm,	 with	very	little	expression	in	the	nuclear	region.	The	nucleus: cell	intensity	fluorescence	ratio	of	the	sensor	in	the	G2-phase	 cells	is	therefore	lower	than	for	the	remaining	G1-	and	M-phase	 cells.

Cell viability assay
SH-SY5Y	and	A549	cells	were	exposed	to	ionomycin	or	 paclitaxel	for	24	h.	Complete	medium	containing	Hoechst	 33342,	calcein	AM,	and	PI	was	added	(to	final	concentrations	 of	5	µM,	0.1	µM,	and	5	µM	respectively)	and	cells	were	incubated	 for	10	min	at	25°C.	Images	were	acquired	on	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	 1000	using	a	10×	objective	and	360/40-nm	excitation	and	 460/40-nm	emission	filters	with	2000-ms	exposure	for	Hoechst	 33342;	475/20-nm	excitation	and	535/50-nm	emission	filters	 with	1000-ms	exposure	for	calcein;	570/20-nm	excitation	and	 620/60-nm	emission	filters	with	100-ms	exposure	for	PI.	 Live	and	dead	subpopulations	were	defined	using	a	2-D	scatter	 plot,	configured	to	identify	and	measure	the	green	fluorescence	 of	calcein	and	the	red	fluorescence	of	PI.	Endogenous	esterases	 active	only	in	living	cells	hydrolyze	calcein	AM	to	the	membraneimpermeant	green	fluorescent	product	calcein,	which	is	 retained	within	live	cells.	In	contrast	the	nucleic	acid	intercalator,	 PI,	is	membrane	impermeant	and	is	a	marker	of	dead	cells.	 2	 28-9193-76	AA	 03/2007

33342	fluorescence	relates	to	the	amount	of	DNA	in	the	nucleus	 and	is	therefore	useful	for	determining	the	nuclear	DNA	content	 of	cells.	Cells	with	an	increased	nuclear	intensity	were	classified	 as	in	M-phase	of	the	cell	cycle	and	remaining	cells	were	 classified	as	G1-phase.	

G2M CCPM Assay
G2M	CCPM	cells	were	exposed	to	a	novel	compound	(A)	for	 24	h	and	48	h.	Cells	were	incubated	with	BrdU	and	Hoechst	 33342	and	BrdU	staining	was	detected	as	described	for	the	 G1S	CCPM	Assay.	Images	were	acquired	using	360/40-nm	 excitation	and	460/40-nm	emission	filters	with	500-ms	 exposure	for	Hoechst	33342;	475/20-nm	excitation	and	 535/50-nm	emission	filters	with	2000-ms	exposure	for	GFP;	 620/60-nm	excitation	and	700/75-nm	emission	filters	with	 500-ms	exposure	for	Cy5. S-phase	cells	exhibited	an	increased	Cy5	nucleus:cell	intensity	 ratio	as	described	for	the	G1S	CCPM	Assay.	In	G1-	and	G2-phase	 cells,	the	G2M	CCPM	sensor	is	found	mostly	in	the	cytoplasm	 and	therefore	the	nuclear	fluorescence	intensity	of	the	 sensor	is	much	lower	than	for	the	remaining	M-phase	cells.	 The	fluorescence	intensity	of	the	G2M	CCPM	sensor	in	the	 cytoplasm	of	G2-phase	cells	is	brighter	than	for	G1-phase	cells.

Results and discussion
Cell viability
Live	and	dead	cell	populations	were	vizualized	for	classification	 (Fig	1)	using	a	2-D	scatter	plot	of	the	integrated	(total)	nuclear	 intensity	of	calcein	(representing	live	cells)	and	integrated	 nuclear	intensity	of	PI	(representing	dead	cells).	The	populations	 were	defined	using	two	linear	discriminants,	which	were	moved	 manually	to	specify	live,	dead,	and	unclassified	populations	 (unclassified	objects	arise	due	to	inappropriate	segmentation	 or	represent	false	objects	due	to	compound	autofluorescence).	 The	number	and	percentage	of	each	population	were	 then	reported.	 Treatment	of	A549	cells	with	the	cytotoxic	compound	 ionomycin,	resulted	in	a	dose-dependent	decrease	in	both	 cell	number	and	live	cells	(%)	and	a	corresponding	increase	 in	dead	cells	due	to	cytotoxicity	(Fig	2A).	Similar	results	were	 obtained	for	ionomycin	treatment	of	SH-SY5Y	cells	(Fig	2B).	 However,	treatment	of	SH-SY5Y	cells	with	low	concentrations	 (between	2	and	500	nM)	of	the	cell	cycle	inhibitor	paclitaxel	 induced	a	reduction	in	cell	number	that	was	not	associated	 with	cytotoxicity	(Fig	2B).	At	higher	concentrations	(>	30	µM),	 cytotoxicity	caused	a	decrease	in	the	number	of	live	cells.

Apoptosis and viability
In	the	Multi	Target	Analysis	Module,	classification	of	healthy,	 apoptotic	and	dead	(secondary	and	primary	necrotic)	 subpopulations	present	in	annexin	V/PI	assays	was	achieved	 with	a	simple	two-step	hierarchical	decision	process	(Fig	3).	 A	1-D	frequency	plot	and	user-defined	threshold	was	used	to	 visualize	and	discriminate	the	subpopulation	of	cells	exhibiting	 PI	fluorescence	(dead	cells).	The	remaining	cells	were	visualized	 on	a	2-D	scatter	plot	of	FITC-Annexin	V	fluorescence	and	 Hoechst	33342	nuclear	intensity	and	classified	into	healthy	 and	apoptotic	populations	by	applying	a	user-defined	 linear	discriminant. Ionomycin	treatment	of	U-2	OS	cells	for	4-h	caused	cytotoxicity,	 resulting	in	a	reduction	in	cell	number	and	induction	of	apoptosis	 and	necrosis,	evident	from	the	increased	FITC-Annexin	V	 and	PI	fluorescence	(Fig	4A).	In	contrast,	24-h	treatment	of	 U-2	OS	cells	with	vinblastine,	caused	cytotoxicity	at	higher	 concentrations	(>	30	µM)	shown	by	the	decrease	in	both	cell	

number	and	healthy	cells	but	also	induced	a	cytostatic	effect	at	 lower	concentrations	(between	1	and	25	nM)	observed	as	a	 decrease	in	cell	number	only	(Fig	4B).	No	apoptosis	was	 observed	after	24-h	treatment	with	vinblastine. In	U-2	OS	cells,	exposure	to	the	cell	cycle	inhibitor	paclitaxel	 produced	a	biphasic,	dose-dependent	decrease	in	cell	number	 and	a	decrease	in	viable	cells	at	high	concentrations	due	 to	cytotoxicity	(Fig	5A).	Analysis	of	selected	multiparametric	 measures	associated	with	the	healthy	subpopulation,	 demonstrated	changes	in	both	nuclear	area	and	form	factor	 (associated	with	nuclear	symmetry;	Fig	5B)	that	correlated	 with	the	cell	number	decrease	effected	by	lower	concentrations	 of	drug.	Stabilization	of	mitotic	spindles	resulting	in	G2/M	arrest	 is	characteristic	of	cells	exposed	to	low	concentrations	of	 paclitaxel	(2)	and	the	cytostatic	effect	correlates	with	the	 observed	changes	in	nuclear	area	and	symmetry	of	the	healthy	 population.	No	apoptosis	was	detected	after	24-h	treatment	 with	paclitaxel.	

Fig 3.	Visualization	and	classification	of	healthy,	apoptotic,	and	dead	subpopulations	in	FITC-Annexin	V/PI	apoptosis	assay.	Analysis	employed	a	user-defined	 two-step	hierarchical	decision	making	protocol	(left)	to	define	three	subpopulations.	In	Step	1,	cells	exhibiting	nuclear	PI	fluorescence	above	background	levels	 were	visualized	using	a	1-D	frequency	plot	(centre)	and	a	user-defined	threshold	(blue	line)	was	applied	to	discriminate	the	dead	(red,	dead	population	D)	 subpopulation	of	cells	from	cells	that	are	not	dead	(population	ND).	In	Step	2,	population	‘ND’	was	visualized	using	a	2-D	scatter	plot	(right)	of	FITC-Annexin	V	 fluorescence	(y-axis)	and	Hoechst	33342	nuclear	intensity	(x-axis).	Apoptotic	cells	(green,	FITC-Annexin	V	stained	population	A)	and	healthy	cells	(blue-only,	 population	H)	were	classified	by	applying	a	user-defined	linear	discriminant	(blue	line).

U-2	OS	cells	 were	exposed	to	(A)	ionomycin	for	4	h	(EC50	values	of	11.25,	106,	and	11.13	µM	were	obtained	for	healthy,	apoptotic,	and	dead	populations,	respectively),	and	 (B)	vinblastine	for	24	h	(an	EC50	value	of	65.2	µM	was	obtained	for	healthy	population).	Images	were	acquired	on	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	1000.	Data	were	analyzed	 by	non-linear	regression	(mean	±SD,	n	=	8)	using	GraphPad	Prism	software.

Fig 6.	G1S	cell	cycle	analysis	using	a	three-step	hierarchical	process	based	 on	thresholded	1-D	characteristic	plots.	In	the	first	step	of	analysis	strategy,	 cells	were	classified	into	S-phase	(red,	BrdU	incorporation)	through	analysis	 of	the	red	nuclear	signal	(anti-BrdU	Cy5).		G2-phase	cells	were	highlighted	in	 the	second	step	due	to	the	characteristically	low	green	nucleus:	cell	intensity	 ratio	of	the	G1S	CCPM	sensor	in	these	cells.	G1-phase	and	M-phase	cells	were	 discriminated	in	the	final	step	on	the	basis	of	DNA	content	(2n	or	4n)	using	the	 total	blue	nuclear	intensity	of	the	Hoechst	33342	signal.	Individual	cells	are	 labeled	in	the	image	display	window	according	to	classification,	whilst	the	 heatmap	can	be	used	to	display	subpopulation	analysis	for	the	whole	plate.

Results	shown	are	(A)	whole	population	(EC50	values	of	 0.23,	295.6,	and	291.6	µM	were	obtained	for	cell	number,	healthy,	and	dead	 populations	respectively);	and	(B)	reported	measures	for	healthy	subpopulation	 only.	Images	were	acquired	on	the	IN	Cell	Analyzer	1000.	Data	were	analyzed	 by	non-linear	regression	(mean	±SD,	n	=	8)	using	GraphPad	Prism	software.	

Cell cycle
For	the	G1S	CCPM	Assay,	the	cell	cycle	subpopulations	were	 classified	using	a	hierarchical	process	consisting	of	three	linked	 1-D	threshold	filters	(Fig	6).	S-phase	cells	were	first	discriminated	 based	on	increased	red	fluorescence	due	to	Cy5	labeled	 secondary	antibody.	Cells	with	a	Cy5	nucleus:	cell	intensity	 ratio	greater	than	the	threshold	are	classified	S-phase	and	 reported.	The	remaining	cells	were	classified	further	using	 a	threshold	filter	to	discriminate	G2-phase	cells.	The	nucleus:	 cell	intensity	fluorescence	ratio	of	the	sensor	in	the	G2-phase	 cells	is	lower	than	for	the	remaining	G1-	and	M-phase	cells	 and	a	suitable	threshold	was	selected	for	discrimination.	 Finally,	G1-	and	M-phase	cells	were	discriminated	based	on	 integrated	(total)	nuclear	intensity	of	Hoechst	33342.	Cells	with	 an	integrated	nuclear	intensity	greater	than	the	threshold	 value	were	classified	as	in	M-phase	of	the	cell	cycle	and	 remaining	cells	were	classified	as	G1-phase.

Fig 7.	Dose	response	curves	for	G1S	CCPM	Assays.	G1-,	S-,	G2-,	and	M-phase	 subpopulations	were	classified	according	to	a	three-step	hierarchical	decision	 process.	U-2	OS	cells	stably	expressing	the	G1S	CCPM	sensor	were	treated	 with	increasing	concentrations	of	(A)	roscovitine	for	24	h	(EC50	values	of	11.5,	 51.2,	and	2.25	µM	were	obtained	for	cell	number,	%	G1,	and	%	G2	respectively),	 and	(B)	nocodazole	for	16	h	(EC50	values	of	67.9	and	150	nM	were	obtained	 for	cell	number	and	%	G2	respectively).	Images	were	acquired	on	the	IN	Cell	 Analyzer	1000.	Data	were	analyzed	by	non-linear	regression	(mean	±SD,	 n	=	8)	using	GraphPad	Prism	software.

Treatment	of	the	G1S	CCPM	stable	cell	line	with	roscovitine,	 a	cyclin-dependent	kinase	1/2	inhibitor,	resulted	in	cell	cycle	 arrest	in	G1-	and	G2-	phases	(Fig	7A).	At	lower	concentrations	 between	5	and	15	µM,	a	significant	increase	in	the	G2	 population	was	observed.	Treatment	with	high	concentrations	 of	roscovitine	(>	30	µM)	resulted	in	a	dose-dependent	increase	 in	the	G1	population	and	a	reciprocal	decrease	in	G2-phase	 cells	(%).	Exposure	of	the	cells	to	increasing	concentrations	 of	nocodazole,	a	microtubule	assembly	inhibitor,	induced	cell	 cycle	arrest	in	G2-phase	(Fig	7B). The	cell	cycle	populations	for	the	G2M	CCPM	Assay	were	 classified	based	on	a	decision	process	involving	two	threshold	 filters	and	a	2-D	scatter	plot	filter.	The	first	threshold	filter	was	 set	up	to	discriminate	S-phase	cells	as	for	the	G1S	CCPM	Assay.	 The	second	filter	was	a	threshold	filter	to	discriminate	M-phase	 cells	from	G1-	and	G2-phase	based	on	a	threshold	value	for	 the	nuclear	fluorescence	intensity	of	the	G2M	CCPM	sensor.	 Finally,	G1-	and	G2-phase	cells	were	discriminated	using	a	 2-D	scatter	plot	filter,	using	a	combination	of	the	nucleus:	cell	 intensity	fluorescence	ratio	of	the	G2M	CCPM	sensor,	and	the	 cell	intensity	of	Hoechst	33342	fluorescence.	 Treatment	of	the	G2M	CCPM	stable	cell	line	with	higher	 concentrations	of	a	novel	compound	(compound	A)	for	24	h	 demonstrated	a	decrease	in	cell	number,	an	increase	in	G1phase	cells	(%)	and	a	reciprocal	decrease	in	S-phase	cells,	 with	no	observed	effect	on	G2-phase	cells	(Fig	8A).	The	effect	 is	consistent	with	cell	cycle	arrest	in	G1-phase	and	is	more	 evident	after	treatment	for	48	h	(Fig	8B).	In	contrast,	closer	 examination	of	the	nuclear	characteristics	of	the	cells	after	 48	h,	demonstrated	an	increase	in	nuclear	area	with	increasing	 concentration	of	compound	A	(Fig	9);	indicative	of	a	G2	 phenotype	and	G2-phase	arrest.	However,	an	additional	 observation	is	the	corresponding	increase	in	nuclear	 asymmetry	(evident	from	the	observed	increase	in	nuclear		 1/form	factor)	suggesting	an	abnormal	mitosis.

U-2	OS	cells	stably	expressing	the	G2M	CCPM	sensor	were	treated	with	culture	medium	(control,	top	panel;	A,	C,	and	E)	or	 compound	A	(treated,	bottom	panel;	B,	D,	and	F)	for	24	and	48	h.	Interactive	2-D	scatter	plots	were	generated	for	A	and	B,	total	BrdU	intensity	(y-axis)	and	total	 Hoechst	33342	intensity	(x-axis),	24	h;	(C	and	D),	total	BrdU	intensity	(y-axis),	and	total	Hoechst	33342	intensity	(x-axis),	48	h	(red	data	points	represent	replicating	 cells,	blue	data	points	represent	non-replicating	cells);	(E	and	F),	nuclear	elongation	(y-axis)	and	total	Hoechst	33342	intensity	(x-axis),	48	h	(black	and	red	data	 points	represent	control	and	treated	cells	respectively).	Each	plot	shows	individual	cell	data	from	control	or	treated	(3.3-µM	compound	A)	wells	(n	=	1;	four	fields	 of	view).

Further	analysis	and	visualization	of	the	level	of	BrdU	 incorporation	and	total	Hoechst	33342	intensity	(representing	 DNA	replication	and	genomic	complement	respectively)	for	 cells	treated	with	compound	A,	revealed	a	decrease	in	the	 number	of	replicating	cells	(further	evidence	of	G1-phase	 arrest)	and	an	increase	in	the	number	of	cells	demonstrating	 greater	DNA	complement	(4n	and	8n;	Figs	10A–F).	After	48	h,	 the	number	of	replicating	cells	has	significantly	decreased	 (Fig	10D)	and	the	majority	of	cells	exhibit	4n	and	8n	DNA	 complement	(Fig	10F).	These	results	suggest	that	compound	 A	has	caused	endoreduplication,	leading	to	polyploidy	and	 cell	cycle	arrest	in	G1-phase.	

Ionomycin	treatment	of	A549	cells	produced	a	dose-dependent	 decrease	in	cell	number	and	a	corresponding	decrease	in	cell	 viability	(EC50	=	11.65	and	17.34	µM	respectively).	Ionomycin	 treatment	of	SH-SY5Y	cells	produced	similar	results	(EC50	=	11.9	 and	23.2	µM	for	cell	number	and	viability,	respectively).	 Treatment	of	SH-SY5Y	cells	with	the	cell	cycle	inhibitor	paclitaxel,	 caused	a	decrease	in	cell	number	at	lower	concentrations	 (corresponding	to	a	cytostatic	effect)	and	a	decrease	in	 both	cell	number	and	viability	at	higher	concentrations	due	 to	cytotoxicity.	 In	the	detection	of	apoptosis,	ionomycin	treatment	of	U-2	OS	 cells	caused	rapid	cytotoxicity	and	induced	apoptosis	and	 necrosis	(EC50	=	11.25,	106,	and	11.13	µM	for	healthy,	apoptotic,	 and	dead	populations	respectively).	Exposure	of	U-2	OS	cells	 to	both	vinblastine	and	paclitaxel	produced	a	biphasic	dosedependent	decrease	in	cell	number	and	an	increase	in	necrotic	 cells	at	high	concentrations,	due	to	cytotoxicity.	Further	 investigation	of	the	cytostatic	effect	of	paclitaxel	at	lower	 concentrations,	showed	a	correlation	with	an	increase	in	both	 nuclear	area	and	form	factor,	characteristic	of	G2/M	arrest.

Conclusions
The	advanced	hierarchical	classification	tools	within	the	 Multi	Target	Analysis	Module	can	be	used	to	analyze	a	range	of	 complex	multicolor	cell	based	assays	and	identify	cells	in	multiple	 subpopulations.	The	example	assays	utilized	a	combination	 of	fluorescent	markers	to	discriminate	cell	viability,	apoptosis,	 and	cell	cycle	populations	in	both	live-	and	fixed-cell	format.

In	the	analysis	of	cell	cycle	populations,	treatment	of	the	G1S	 CCPM	stable	cell	line	with	roscovitine,	a	cyclin-dependent	 kinase	1/2	inhibitor,	resulted	in	cell	cycle	arrest	in	G1-phase	 at	high	concentrations	(EC50	=	51.2	µM)	and	G2-phase	at	 lower	concentrations	(EC50	=	2.25	µM).	Exposure	of	the	cells	to	 increasing	concentrations	of	nocodazole,	a	microtubule	 assembly	inhibitor,	produced	an	increase	in	the	G2	population	 (EC50	=	150	nM).	Analysis	of	the	exposure	of	the	G2M	CCPM	 cell	line	to	a	novel	compound,	using	the	2-D	scatter	plot	as	both	 classification	filter	and	visualization	tool,	revealed	that	the	 compound	caused	endoreduplication,	resulting	in	cells	with	 increased	DNA	complement	and	cell	cycle	arrest	in	G1-phase.
