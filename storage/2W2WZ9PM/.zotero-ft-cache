Introduction

these microscopes to be used to study a wide range of physiological parameters in ﬁxed and living cells, tissue sections, and even live animals [1–4]. But it is the availability of 3D image analysis software which runs on lowcost personal computers that makes 3D and 4D imagebased research practical. This review examines some of the software tools and techniques that are available to process, analyze, and display these images. Most 3D imaging software can be divided into ﬁve functional modules: image acquisition, processing, rendering, segmentation, and measurement (ﬁg. 1). The software will include one or more of these functional modules. Commercial software often consists of a base program, with additional modules that can be purchased as needed. Some programs can be customized by the user to perform additional tasks.

Advances in light microscopy now enable researchers to easily acquire multi-channel three-dimensional (3D) images and 3D time series (4D). Conventional light microscopes produce two-dimensional (2D) images that provide a limited amount of information about the organization of cells and tissues in three dimensions. Several computer-controlled ﬂuorescence microscopy systems are available commercially which can collect a stack of closely-spaced 2D images, then use software to display and manipulate the stack as a single 3D image. The availability of a variety of speciﬁc ﬂuorescent probes allows

Image Acquisition

Image acquisition programs, which control microscopes and associated imaging hardware, are used to collect and store stacks of parallel planar (2D) images in ﬁles. These 3D ﬁles are then passed to other programs to be processed, displayed, and analyzed. Unfortunately, there is no standard ﬁle format for 3D images, so some microscope manufacturers have created their own formats, while others use TIFF or variants of TIFF.

quantitative studies [5, 6]. However, care should be taken when selecting a deconvolution algorithm, since some algorithms are not suitable for quantitative photometric studies. See the review by Wallace et al. [7] for a more detailed discussion of deconvolution. Most commercial microscopy-oriented imaging programs provide 3D deconvolution modules, including Huygens, Volocity, Imaris, analySIS, Amira, MetaMorph, and Image-Pro Plus. Some of them use the AutoDeblur software developed by AutoQuant. However, there are only a few free 3D deconvolution programs, notably XCOSM (www.omrfcosm.omrf. org/xcosm) and plug-ins for ImageJ [8] by Besson and Dougherty. Figure 2 shows an example of using deconvolution on an image of a fetal mouse kidney.

Manufacturers often provide free image viewer programs for their ﬁles that permit you to display and print images. However, additional software is needed to perform sophisticated image processing, analysis, and volume rendering. When evaluating 3D imaging software, make sure that the software that you are considering fully supports the ﬁle formats used by your microscopy system(s). This is important because these ﬁles contain more than just images. They often include information on microscope conﬁguration and imaging parameters, and some of this information is used by 3D image processing, rendering, and measurement software. One project that is trying to standardize how microscopy data are stored and retrieved is the Open Microscopy Environment (www.openmicroscopy.org).

Volume Rendering

Image Processing

Various image processing operations may need to be performed on 3D images before they are displayed or analyzed. Some operations attempt to correct for distortion introduced by microscope optics and tissue during image acquisition (e.g. deconvolution, spherical aberration correction), or spectral overlap of ﬂuorophores (e.g. linear unmixing), while ratiometric operators are used when studying ion concentration or pH, and various ﬁlters and intensity transformations may be used to improve the visibility of structures. The simpler image processing operations, such as intensity and color transformations, are often performed interactively during volume rendering. One particularly interesting image processing technique is deconvolution, which can improve the visibility of small structures in some images by increasing resolution and contrast. Deconvolution can also be useful in

Volume rendering programs are used to create 2D projection images showing 3D stacks of cross-sectional images from various points of view. A few of these programs can also display sequences of 3D stacks collected over an extended period of time, which can be very useful in developmental studies [9]. Volume rendering programs can also usually perform simple image processing, including adjusting brightness, contrast, color, and opacity. Some volume rendering programs use the 3D graphics processor found on video boards in many personal computers to accelerate the rendering process, permitting the user to more quickly and easily manipulate 3D images. When selecting volume rendering software, it is crucial that your video board be equipped with one of the processors supported by the software, and that your computer has an appropriate amount of memory. Most of the major commercial imaging programs for microscopy include a volume rendering module. There are also several free volume rendering programs available, but only a few of them can import the 3D image ﬁles produced on microscopy systems. Voxx [10] and VisBio [11] are two such programs. Free volume rendering plugins are also available for ImageJ. Figure 3 shows an example of volume rendering of the ureteric tree of a fetal mouse kidney using Voxx.

Image Segmentation and Analysis

Segmentation is the process of separating an image into discrete regions. For example, DAPI-labeled nuclei can be segmented from an image of cultured cells. The

segmented nuclei can then be counted or measured. Segmentation software can use several properties to group pixels or voxels, including intensity, intensity gradients, color, shape, orientation, and connectivity. Automatic segmentation is the ideal, but tracing the boundaries of regions by hand is still commonly done, due to the complexity of many biological structures. Once structures

have been segmented, morphometric and photometric measurements can be made in the segmented regions. For example, measuring colocalization of different ﬂuorophores is such a task. Figure 4 shows an example of segmentation of a fetal mouse kidney using Amira [for more information on segmentation, see 12–14].

Conclusions

Voxx and VisBio are volume rendering programs, while the other programs can be used to segment and measure images.

Software

There are many programs available for 3D image processing, but only a few of them can handle the multi-channel 3D and 4D images produced by confocal and twophoton microscopes. A list of several microscopy-oriented programs is included in table 1, along with website addresses where information on each program can be found. Commercial software developers usually provide free trial versions of programs that can be downloaded from their websites. These either provide limited-time access to all of the features in the program, or access to a subset of the features with no time limit. Most of the commercial imaging programs have a similar set of features, which makes it more difﬁcult to decide which software to purchase. You should always process some of your images using the trial version of the software, to make sure that it really can do the job. You should also consider ease of use. And ﬁnally, look at the total cost of ownership: the price of the base program, additional modules, multi-user licenses, and yearly software updates. Most commercial 3D imaging software is expensive, so limited funds may force individual researchers to use whatever program(s) their institution has already purchased. Consequently, many researchers use a combination of commercial software and free non-commercial software. ImageJ [8] is probably the most widely used of the noncommercial imaging programs, augmented by many user-developed plug-ins. An online manual de-

There are many 3D imaging programs available, but only a few of them have been designed for 3D light microscopy. Before selecting such software, you should ask the following: (1) Will this software be able to import ﬁles from all of the microscopes that you use? (2) Does the software include all of the features that you need? For commercial packages, how many additional modules will you have to purchase to meet your analysis needs? (3) Will you need to use more than one program to analyze your images? If so, can image and data ﬁles created by each program be read by the other programs? (4) Do you have the required hardware (e.g. enough memory, suitable video board) to use the imaging software? Given the expense of commercial software, and the long learning curve associated with most imaging software, one should thoroughly examine the capabilities of the programs and applicability to both present and future projects before making a purchase.
