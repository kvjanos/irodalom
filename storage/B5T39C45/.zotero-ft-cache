3D cell culture meets automated HCS.
3D cell culture models replicate in vivo tissue biolog y more accurately than conventional 2D monoculture, however their use in drug discover y has been limited because of the dif f iculties in using matrix components and imaging 3D multiwell plates. Now, the iuvo Microchannel 5250 plates make it possible to use 3D cell models in a highly miniaturized format on automated HC S plat forms. The plates have 192 submicroliter channels in an SBS/ANSI format and are fully compatible with t ypical liquid dispensing and automated microscopy equipment. Af ter f illing the microchannels with suspensions of cells in matrix, the patented passive pumping technolog y allows multiple c ycles of f luid exchange for medium replacement, molecular staining or immunoc y tochemistr y protocols.

Automated HCS assays in microchannels instead of wells. • Low volume (70 0 ηl) reduces cell and reagent usage, allowing use of primar y cells. • 14 0 μm height allows imaging of entire microchannel in z- dimension. • Passive pumping through matrix allows in situ staining and immunoc y tochemistr y.

How it works:

Growth induction of T47D breast carcinoma cells by HMF is reversed by blocking SDF-1 signalling or MMP activity: (A–D) Immunofluorescence labelling of 3D collagen cultures in microchannel devices. T47D cells were labelled with pancytokeratin antibody (red), HMF vimentin antibody (green) and Hoechst 33342 (blue). (A) T47D cell clusters in co-cultures with HMF. Inhibition of MMP activity by GM6001 (B) or blocking SDF-1 signalling by addition of AMD3100 (C) reduces growth of T47D cell clusters to levels seen in T47D monoculture (D). Quantification of T47D cell growth in conventional (E) and microfluidics (F) 3D collagen cultures. (G) GM6001 or AMD3100 does not influence T47D cell growth in monoculture.

In the iuvo MC 5250, cells are grown in a 700 ηl microchannel with an input port at one end and a larger output port at the other end. Droplets of liquid including cell suspensions, are dispensed to the surface of the plate using standard liquid handling equipment. Following initial wickfilling from the output port, the liquid contents of the channel can be displaced as many times as necessary by adding a droplet to the input port. The higher surface tension of the small drop at the input port forces it into the channel. The overflow accumulates at the output port and can be asiprated as needed. The passive pumping mechanism functions even when channels are filled with fibrillar collagen. This means you can do protocols requiring multiple wash steps, such as immunocytochemistry, in situ, in a 3D matrix.
