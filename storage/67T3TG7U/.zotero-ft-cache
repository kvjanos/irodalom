High-throughput studies of biological systems are rapidly accumulating a wealth of ‘omics’-scale data. Visualization is a key aspect of both the analysis and understanding of these data, and users now have many visualization methods and tools to choose from. The challenge is to create clear, meaningful and integrated visualizations that give biological insight, without being overwhelmed by the intrinsic complexity of the data. In this review, we discuss how visualization tools are being used to help interpret protein interaction, gene expression and metabolic profile data, and we highlight emerging new directions.
Visualization has long been key in helping to understand biological systems, such as metabolism1, signaling2 and the regulation of gene expression3. In recent years, the study of such systems has been profoundly influenced by the development of a wide range of high-throughput experimental methods (Box 1), resulting in a greatly increased volume of complex, interconnected data. Remarkably, in spite of these changes, and in spite of the development of new methods for visualizing and analyzing these data, we still use the same primary visual metaphor to communicate ideas about biological systems: namely, pathways (graphs that show overall changes in state) or, more generally, networks (graphs that do not necessarily show state changes). As high-throughput experimental methods have become more routine, many more scientists are using network and pathway visualization to record and communicate their findings. There are now over 300 web resources4 (see http://pathguide.org/) providing access to many thousands of pathways and networks that document millions of interactions between proteins, genes and small molecules. There has been a corresponding increase in the development of visualization tools for systems biology data5–7. These tools are very diverse, but they can be broadly divided into two partly overlapping categories, the first consisting of tools focused on automated methods for interpreting and exploring large biological networks (Table 1), and the second consisting of tools focused on assembly and curation of pathways (Table 2). Many of these tools are tightly integrated with public databases, thus allowing users to visualize and interpret their own data in the context of previous knowledge. For users and developers of these visualization tools, one of the key challenges is how to benefit from the explosion in systems biology data without being overwhelmed by it—or, in practical terms, how to present the data at the right level of detail, in a cohesive, insightful manner. Clearly, the answers depend on context. In this review, we first discuss the methods and tools now being used to visualize and analyze data sets from three main types of high-throughput experiments: namely, the investigation of protein-protein interactions, of gene expression profiles and of metabolic profiles. Such experiments are used to study cellular response to a wide variety of conditions—including drug exposure, disease states and specific genetic

Several search engines have been developed to predict peptides and proteins through the comparison of experimentally measured spectra to theoretical spectra (predicted from sequence databases). Quality scores provide a measure of the reliability of a given protein or peptide identification123. For example, for Mascot124, the most broadly used algorithm, the score features the number of identified peptides (sequence coverage). The overall quality of entire MS data sets is generally measured by the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the ‘expected’ proportion of incorrect assignments among the accepted assignments. The most popular approach to calculate FDR is based on the use of a target-decoy database123. Also, an array of visualization tools has been developed to evaluate the technical quality of the samples and of MS runs. For example, the overall distribution of peptides in an LC-MS map can be visualized with Pep3D125 or TOPPView126, enabling the detection of possible biases, the presence of chemical contaminants or poor separations during the LC (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, Pep3D can integrate quality scores for individual protein or peptide identifications generated by search engines into these maps (Supplementary Fig. 3). We list tools for mass spectrometry data visualization and evaluation in Supplementary Table 1. In metabolomics applications, owing to large chemical diversity and variation in molecular composition of the analytes, various chromatographic systems, such as gas chromatography (GC), LC or electrochemistry (EC), are generally applied before MS. GC-MS is the most popular method for global metabolite profiling127. It can be complemented with LC-MS analysis to identify compounds that are not suitable for GC-MS analysis128. Similarly to the approaches developed for peptides, metabolites can be identified on the basis of their fragmentation patterns, for which mass spectral fingerprint libraries are being developed. Because the raw data are of the same kind as in proteomics mass spectrometry studies, very similar visualization methods are used to assess data quality (Supplementary Table 1). Nuclear magnetic resonance. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a common method in metabolomics and, in contrast to MS-based approaches, in most cases does not require analyte separation. NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed information on the molecular structure of compounds found in complex mixtures, and a wide range of small molecule metabolites in a sample can be detected simultaneously. Biofluids, cell and tissue extracts can be analyzed with minimal sample preparation through the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy129. With the use of two-dimensional NMR spectra, the identification and reliable quantification of individual metabolites becomes feasible, which enables NMR-based metabolite profiling. Data processing and spectral deconvolution are challenging, and databases of NMR spectra of pure metabolites are not yet comprehensive, but they nonetheless do already help in the identification process130. Applications such as MetaboMiner131 can be used for the semiautomated identification of metabolites in two-dimensional NMR spectra, supported by visualizations that allow the scientist to inspect the matches of peaks to reference spectra and assess match quality.

Oligonucleotide microarrays. The most widely used methods to monitor the expression levels of RNA transcripts in a biological sample are based on microarrays. They measure the hybridization of fluorescently labeled cDNA, synthesized from extracted mRNA, to known nucleotide sequences spotted on solid surfaces117. For all genes on the microarray, an expression value is derived from the fluorescence intensity of the hybridized RNAs. These expression values are typically unitless and have meaning only in the context of a reference measurement. Before further analysis takes place, the measurements must therefore be normalized to remove systematic biases and to make it possible to compare measurements from different samples. Quality assessment is likewise essential for the validity of later analyses. This is typically performed with the help of (platformdependent) quality scores at the level of both individual probes and entire arrays, complemented by diagnostic visualization tools that have been developed for this purpose118,119. Evaluating the quality of individual arrays is routinely done with spatial intensity distributions plots and plots of intensity ratio versus mean intensity (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Comparison of multiple arrays can be achieved with intensity box plots, which are a practical tool to detect outlier arrays that should be excluded from subsequent analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Several tools that provide quality assessment visualizations are listed in Supplementary Table 1. rNa deep sequencing. The most recent transcriptomics approaches are based on the deep sequencing of transcripts extracted from biological samples33. The resulting sequence reads—typically 30 to 400 base pairs long, depending on the DNA-sequencing technology used—are then commonly aligned to a reference genome and evaluated to determine their quality. Tools for data processing and quality assessment typically provide diagnostic visualizations. Examples include the R/ Bioconductor packages ShortRead120 and edgeR121. The latter provides many functions that are analogous to those in the limma package122 for transcriptomics data from microarrays. Reads aligned to a genome can also be visualized and evaluated with some of the more recent genome browsers that can handle short read data, such as the Integrative Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). This and similar tools are discussed in the accompanying review by Nielsen et al.72. mass spectrometry. In mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, the compounds present in a sample are identified through the accurate measurements of their mass-to-charge ratios. MS has applications in many fields, including proteomics, metabolomics and interactome mapping. In proteomic applications, typical MS data sets consist of lists of proteolytic peptides characterized by their mass-tocharge ratios (MS spectra, MS1). These peptides can be further fragmented and measurements of the resulting mass spectra (MS-MS spectra or tandem MS spectra, MS2) used to deduce their sequences. In some cases, complex samples must be fractionated and proteolytic peptides are separated using high performance liquid chromatography (LC) before MS analysis (LC-MS).

perturbations (for example, gene deletions, gene insertions and siRNA knockdowns). Often, these experiments produce new knowledge that is then either added to existing pathways or used to create new pathways. Thus, we end with a discussion of methods and tools for pathway editing. protein interaction data A range of experimental methods are at present being used for high-throughput studies of protein interactions 8. For instance, in yeast, pairwise interactions have been studied on the genome scale using yeast two-hybrid screens or protein complementation assays, whereas the assembly of proteins within complexes has been systematically charted using tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) (Box 1 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Recent analyses have estimated that, in yeast, some 20,000 pairwise interactions may take place between the ~5,000 gene products9, and about 800 protein complexes may exist10. As a result of these and similar studies in other species, vast amounts of protein interaction data are accumulating in public databases11,12 such as DIP13, HPRD14 and IntAct15.

The size and complexity of these data sets can be daunting; hence, a common general strategy is to iteratively dissect the data sets into smaller subsets. Typically, these subsets are defined as sets of proteins that belong to the same complex, or that are found at the same subcellular location, or that belong to a similar functional category. Visualization is key in this strategy, as human judgment and intervention are often needed, in part because of errors (false positives and false negatives) in protein interaction data sets9,16. Many visualization tools have been developed specifically to support the analysis of protein networks (Table 1); here we discuss how these tools can be used to help dissect large data sets of interactions, extract biological insight and generate hypotheses leading to further experimental investigations. As proteins rarely act alone, a first step in analyzing a protein interaction data set is to identify protein complexes and groups of complexes. For small, simple networks, visualized as a graph in which each node represents a protein and each edge represents an interaction between two proteins, the arrangement of proteins and complexes can usually be seen clearly using a standard ‘force-directed’ layout17, which automatically arranges each node

to minimize the number of edge crossings while trying to keep the lengths of all edges a b approximately the same. However, this approach quickly becomes inadequate as the network size and complexity increase (Fig. 1a). Instead, clustering approaches are used, which predict higher-order protein complexes from the interaction data. One very commonly used tool for this purpose is MCODE18. For TAP-MS and other data sets where components of protein complexes are experimentally determined, other clustering methods are used (for example, c ‘clique percolation’19). The results of these d clustering analyses can then be used to change the layout and appearance of the network (Fig. 1a,b) in a way that may yield biological insights that cannot be easily obtained by simply examining lists of proteins or protein complexes. For instance, by viewing the network, the scientist may notice connections between two complexes that suggest a previously unknown biological relationship.

can be indicated using node coloring; this can be particularly useful when studying the interactions of complexes that move between subcellular locations (Fig. 1e). Another common strategy is to arrange the network so that all proteins belonging to the same subcellular location are gathered together in one region (Fig. 2, see 2a). For small networks, such a layout depicting subcellular localization is often created manually. However, for large networks, it is much more convenient to use tools that can achieve such a layout automatically, such as Cerebral26 (Fig. 2a) and PATIKA27. These tools also draw boundaries or use shading so that the scientist can see clearly which regions of the network correspond to which subcellular locations. Protein interaction data sets commonly do not capture information about dynamic changes in protein abundance. Thus, as with spatial information, it is often useful to include temporal information from other experiments—for example, by identifying proteins whose abundance is known to vary throughout the cell cycle. This information can be used to simplify a large network by either depicting only proteins that are coexpressed or by mapping expression or abundance profiles of proteins of interest onto nodes28 in the network, as described in more detail below (see Network enrichment). These processes of dissection are all aimed at dividing a protein interaction data set into manageable, biologically significant parts that can be interpreted; during this process of interpretation, a scientist often makes use of previously established knowledge, particularly pathways (for example, KEGG29 or Reactome30) and

networks (for example, STITCH31). In some cases, to illustrate a result or insight, it can be useful to add interactions derived from previous studies—thus forming a hybrid network that shows both new and old data (Fig. 1e). expression profile data A range of experimental methods are being used for highthroughput expression profiling (Box 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1); in addition to gene expression profiling with DNA microarrays32 and RNA deep sequencing33, a promising emerging technology is quantitative protein expression profiling based on mass spectrometry34,35. Gene expression profile data sets are being deposited in two main repositories, ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) and Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), with around 15,000 studies now in the public domain. The initial goal in analyzing expression profiles is usually to find a set of genes or, less typically, proteins that share a related pattern of expression—for example, genes that are up- or downregulated in a certain genotype, disease model or human disease, or in response to a drug treatment. The challenge is that a single data set may contain expression profiles for over 10,000 genes, measured over a range of time points and experimental conditions, so that determining which genes are potentially relevant to the studied problem requires an extensive search through a large amount of often noisy, multivariate data. Together with various clustering algorithms, visualization is key in these analyses32, and

a wide range of tools have been developed to aid the visualization process (Table 3). Many of these tools implement a set of commonly applied methods (Box 2 and Fig. 3); in particular, scatter plots combined with dimensionality reduction (Fig. 3a), profile plots (Fig. 3b), heat maps, and dendrograms (Fig. 3c), as well as clustering. As microarray gene expression analysis has matured as an experimental technique, many of the corresponding visualization methods have become well established and are widely used. Network enrichment. Once a list of potentially relevant genes has been found using the above types of analysis, the next task is often to find pathways or networks where these genes are significantly over-represented. These ‘enrichment’ searches can be launched directly from several network visualization tools, for example, GENeVis 36, Reactome SkyPainter 30, Metacore (GeneGo Inc.) or BioLayout Express 3D37. A logical next step is then to map gene expression levels onto the identified pathways. Interpreting expression data in the context of a visualized pathway or network usually proves more insightful than without this type of information. For instance, visualizing the data in the context of pathways may show how the upregulation of a transcription factor explains the upregulation of many other genes under its control (Fig. 2a) and may lead to testable experimental hypotheses. A wide range of representations are used for mapping gene expression levels onto pathways and networks, with the ideal choice depending on the specific experiment and question of interest38 (Fig. 2). A simple approach that is available as part of many tools (Table 1) is to represent expression levels as a color gradient, as in a heat map, and then color the nodes in the network according to their expression level under a particular condition (Fig. 2a).

If expression levels from more than one condition are being studied, some tools (for example, VisANT and VistaClara) allow the scientist to visualize them sequentially, by updating node colors to reflect the expression levels of a selected condition. Some tools switch automatically to depiction of the next condition after a predefined time interval, which leads to an animation-like visualization that is well suited to interpreting data from a time series. An alternative strategy to viewing the data from different conditions in series is to view them in parallel, by arranging multiple versions of the same network in a grid, where each version represents the expression levels (visualized as node color) for one condition or time point. This approach is known as ‘small multiples’39 and allows the scientist to visually compare expression levels between conditions, which is not well supported by animation. A well-designed implementation of small multiples is available in Cerebral26 (Fig. 2a). Besides animation and small multiples, a third approach is to show the complete expression profile within the nodes of a network. The most common representation of this type is based on a miniature heat map embedded in each node (Fig. 2b) and is available in several tools, including GenMAPP 2 (ref. 40), GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies) and ProMeTra41. The Lichen package (http://tinyurl.com/Lichen1/) uses a circular heat map to depict this information, which has the advantage of being very compact (Fig. 2c). VistaClara42 provides ‘heat strips’, in which the heights of the bars as well as their colors correspond to the expression levels (Fig. 2d). In contrast, in GENeVis, bar heights represent confidence measures, so that reliable measurements are taller

and therefore emphasized (Fig. 2e). A less common alternative to showing a heat map embedded in the node is to embed a profile plot in the node. This is supported by, for instance, VisANT (Fig. 2f) and has the advantage that multiple profiles can be displayed in the same node—for example, when a meta-node represents a set of genes. In VANTED, each node of the network has embedded visualizations of exceptionally high detail, showing legends, grid lines, bar charts or error bars (Fig. 2g). Although powerful, this representation requires the nodes to be rather large in order to show the details of the embedded visualizations, which effectively limits its application to only small pathways and networks. For expression profiles with many conditions, visualizing all these data directly in the network is invariably problematic because of a lack of space, and an approach that links visualization of the network to a separate visualization of the expression profiles is more appropriate. In the linked approach, a heat map (as implemented in VistaClara) or a profile plot (as implemented in Cerebral; Fig. 2a) is shown next to the network and when the scientist selects nodes in the network, the corresponding expression profiles are highlighted in the linked heat map or profile plot, or vice versa. This approach allows the scientist to check, for instance, whether the members of a putative protein complex in the network visualization are coexpressed, by comparing the corresponding gene expression profiles in the linked heat map. Conversely, selection of a set of coexpressed genes in a clustered heat map would allow exploration of their role in the linked protein interaction network: the scientist could directly see whether these genes are part of the same complex, what their interaction

Multivariate data, for instance from gene expression studies, are very common in systems biology, and many tools have been developed to analyze and visualize such data (Table 3). The three most commonly used visualization methods are scatter plots, profile plots and heat maps. Scatter plots. Scatter plots (Fig. 3a) are primarily used to examine dependencies between two variables, but in combination with dimensionality reduction methods, they can also be applied to multivariate data. For instance, to gain insight into the global patterns in a gene expression matrix, a dimensionality reduction method may be applied to obtain a two-dimensional (sometimes three-dimensional) representation of the expression profiles, which are then visualized in a scatter plot to reveal clusters and outliers in the data. Some frequently applied dimensionality reduction methods for this purpose are principal component analysis132 (PCA) and multi-dimensional scaling133 (MDS), which are implemented in many tools. Besides PCA and MDS, many other suitable dimensionality reduction methods exist134, but they are often not easily accessible to the casual user. Scatter plots combined with dimensionality reduction methods are an excellent tool for gaining insight into the overall structure of large sets of expression profiles. However, because of the dimensionality reduction itself, it is not possible to extract information about the relationship between expression levels and the conditions under study.

Profile plots. Profile plots (Fig. 3b), also known as parallel coordinate plots135, visualize the expression levels of a large number of transcripts across all samples. Thus, they provide insight into the patterns of correlation between samples and expression levels. For instance, at a glance, the scientist can determine whether a transcript is expressed constitutively in all conditions or whether it is only expressed in a single condition, such as a particular tissue or phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, it is possible to generate hypotheses about trends, such as increasing expression levels for a transcript over time after a stimulus, or differential expression of a transcript—for instance, between samples of diseased and normal tissue. Because many profiles are shown in the same plot, the scientist can interpret such observations in the context of the overall data set. A profile plot can also be queried visually for transcripts with a particular behavior, such as low expression in one set of samples and high in another set, or for profiles that are similar to that of a transcript of interest. A substantial disadvantage of profile plots is that, owing to the manner in which they are constructed, profiles overlap, severely limiting the number of profiles that can be visualized effectively at the same time.

Colors represent abundance (red, higher than control; blue, lower than control; white, no change). Rows of the heat map have been reordered according to a hierarchical clustering, represented by the dendrogram. The color bars between the dendrogram and heat map indicate the k-means clusters, allowing comparison of the two clustering results. Images made with R (http://www.r-project.org/).

Heat maps. Heat maps136,137 (Fig. 3c) are the most commonly used visualization method for expression matrices138 and can be generated using most tools. Like profile plots, heat maps visualize the abundance of each transcript in each sample, but the profiles do not overlap, which means that more profiles can be visualized effectively. However, the size of the heat map grows with the number of profiles, so that the available screen space is often a limiting factor. A key aspect of heat map visualization is the reordering of the rows, which ensures that similar profiles are placed near each other. Typically this reordering is done using hierarchical clustering137, and a dendrogram showing the hierarchy is usually arranged immediately adjacent to the heat map (Fig. 3). This combined view helps a scientist to see groups of genes that have a similar expression pattern. The dendrogram conveys which genes are clustered together, and also which genes are outliers with an unusual expression pattern. The heat map allows the scientist to see in more detail which features of the expression pattern are shared by gene clusters. For example, genes in a cluster may have a peak expression at about the same time in an experiment.

partners are, or whether they are located in the same subcellular compartment. In contrast, when expression profiles are shown only in the nodes of the network, this type of analysis is not possible because coexpressed genes are not necessarily located next to each other in the visualization. However, there is a trade-off between the flexibility provided by linked views and the convenience of being able to see expression profiles and interactions without having to consult two separate visualizations. Network clustering and correlation networks. Recently, there has been increased interest in a new kind of clustering method— called ‘network clustering’37—that is less susceptible to noise and can lead to more accurate identification of functionally related genes than established clustering methods (Box 2). Network clustering of gene expression data is done using so-called ‘correlation networks’, in which each gene is a node and each edge indicates coexpression of two genes under the conditions of the experiment43. As well as being an improved way to calculate clusters, correlation networks allow the scientist to interactively explore gene expression data sets using many of the rich set of network visualization tools that have been developed for visualizing protein interaction networks. The use of correlation networks for gene expression data is as yet supported by relatively few tools, including BioLayout Express 3D37—which has been developed specifically for this purpose—and Cytoscape, using either the MCODE18 or ClusterMaker plug-in (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/ cytoscape/). However, we anticipate that correlation networks may become one of the established methods for interpreting gene expression data sets. metabolic profile data A wide variety of spectroscopic methods are being used for highthroughput studies of small-molecule metabolites44, two of the most popular being mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Box 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Typically, present methods identify hundreds of metabolites per experiment. Additionally, many as-yet-unidentified compounds can be reproducibly detected. These experimental data are collected in several public repositories, the largest of which is now SetupX45, containing ~20,000 samples from more than 300 studies. The general goal in analyzing metabolite profiles is to gain detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms of cellular metabolic pathways. The identification of molecules that may be used as reliable biomarkers of disease is also of great interest. Metabolite profiles are typically analyzed to find sets of metabolites with similar profiles or to measure the impact of genetic modifications, drugs and other biotic or abiotic factors on the metabolome of an organism. As with gene and protein profiles, visualization is key in these analyses, and the same, or very similar, methods (Box 2) and tools (Table 3) are typically used. As for gene expression data, one of the key visualization methods in metabolomics involves the enrichment of metabolic pathways with visualizations of metabolite concentrations (Fig. 4a), and often the same visual representations as for gene expression data can be used (Fig. 2b–g). Visualizing such enriched metabolic pathways can be very useful in understanding the concerted changes of metabolite pools within the cell. In addition, enriched pathways can help to identify metabolites that should be present according to enzymatic

reactions contained in the metabolic pathway but that have not been detected in the measurements. If such metabolites are identified, further experiments attempting to detect these molecules can be conducted. Many visualization tools (for example, MapMan46, Pathway Tools Omics Viewer47, KaPPA-view48, PathwayExplorer49 and ProMeTra41) have been developed to facilitate enriched views of metabolic pathways, usually with close integration of metabolic pathway databases. These tools overlay metabolite profiles primarily on static images of pathways obtained from sources such as KEGG29 or MetaCyc50-based databases. pathway editing The analysis of new experimental data sets, as outlined above, usually produces new insight into biological processes, which may be used to modify existing pathways or to create new pathways. A wide range of tools is available that support pathway editing (Table 2); the choice of which tool to use depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

review
For building pathways from scratch or editing existing pathways, tools such as GenMAPP 2, PathVisio, and VANTED are useful, as they are designed for to assist the manual task of arranging nodes and edges. To this category also belong Cell Designer51 and JDesigner52, which further support pathway simulations by means of kinetic modeling. The insights gained from these simulations often lead to new hypotheses, which can then be tested in further experiments. Manual layout of pathways quickly becomes tedious as the size of the pathway grows. Fortunately, a range of automated layout methods have been developed, each addressing specific layout requirements. Typically, these methods will arrange the network to highlight the overall state changes that occur—for example, making sure that all interactions point from left to right, and thus creating an overall causal flow from left to right. Automated layout can be particularly useful for updating large networks when new knowledge (nodes or interaction edges) becomes available. For example, PATIKA 53 has an automated layout method that shows the causal flow of events through different subcellular compartments. This is particularly useful for depicting signaling networks 27. Although these specialized automated layout methods are useful, they are usually of low quality compared to manually laid out pathways created by human experts and often require manual editing in addition; however, judging by recent progress, we expect these method to continue to improve and to become increasingly useful54. For very large pathways, it can be important to use compact visual representations and pathway layouts that reduce the amount of detail shown. A very clear illustration of such a concise visual representation is iPath, which combines 120 KEGG pathways into a single, vast pathway map that provides an overview of all metabolism in an organism (Fig. 4b). Scientists can zoom into parts of the map to navigate to individual pathways. Future perspectives Systems biology is still rapidly evolving, which can make it difficult for tool developers to know which visualization tasks are the most important ones. However, as the field matures, the key tasks will likely become clearer, and the requirements and limitations of current visualization methods will become better understood5. This process will also be aided by insights from the emerging field of visual analytics55, which specifically studies the role of visualization in the larger process of understanding and interpreting data. Visual analytics methods have begun to be applied to studying the connection between visualization and analytical reasoning in systems biology5,56. We anticipate that the near future will bring significant improvements in automated pathway and network layout to better match biologists’ needs54,57. Innovation will continue to give more and better choices for the representations of nodes, edges and overlay information, as well as better ways to convey dynamic properties and to compare networks. Crucially, we expect that usability will improve, partly through improved navigation methods that help users manage large and complex networks23,25,58. Today, many tools for network and pathway visualization are stand-alone applications (Tables 1 and 2); however, there is a trend toward web-based applications, often coupled tightly to underlying databases. Web-based tools show great promise for facilitating collaboration between scientists at different locations59–61, and several projects have recently been launched that are aimed at community-based collaborative editing of biological network data—notably Payaologue (http://celldesigner.org/ payao/) and WikiPathways62. As experimental methods enable scientists to tackle larger and more complex systems, it is likely that significant innovations will be needed for visualizing future data sets. One possible direction for future network visualization tools would be to move beyond the standard two-dimensional layout, and tool developers are already exploring three-dimensional layouts (for example, BioLayout Express 3D37), combinations of both threedimensional layouts and time (for example, E-Cell 3D, http:// tinyurl.com/ecell3d/), or layouts that mix aspects of two and three dimensions (for example, Arena3D63). In addition, systems biologists may well be among the early adopters of innovations in hardware, such as multi-touch interfaces and larger, highresolution displays64. As systems biology has evolved very quickly over the last decade, some of the difficulties faced by end-users today arise not from the intrinsic complexity of data but from a lack of standards. Biological pathways and networks are now distributed in over 300 web resources 4—and in a field as interdisciplinary as systems biology, there is an obvious strength in such diversity. However, the field would clearly benefit from a parallel effort toward a consolidated resource, and we would like to add our voices to a call for a consolidated database, similar to the worldwide Protein Data Bank for three-dimensional structures65. The situation is somewhat better with file formats used to store interaction data, pathways and biochemical models. Although many formats are used, several have emerged as de facto standards for the exchange of pathway and network data—for example, PSI-MI66 for protein interaction data, BioPAX (http://www. biopax.org/) for pathways and interaction networks, Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)67 for models of biochemical reactions and gene regulation and CellML 68 for exchange of a range of different biological models. In regard to graphical notation, there has recently been a significant community-driven proposal (Systems Biology Graphical Notation, SBGN69) toward developing a more unified standard, and several tools already support the creation and visualization of networks using this standard (see Table 2). Ultimately, systems biology seeks to provide insights into the processes of organelles, cells, organs and even whole organisms. Fulfilling this ambitious goal requires still further development in visualization methods; in particular, better integration with visualization of other kinds of data, such as imaging data70, macromolecular structures71, genomes72, and phylogenies73. Efforts to build such integrated visualization platforms have begun (for example, Visible Cell74), and in fact, many tools that bridge different data types and disciplines are already in place; for instance, there are tools that map transcript abundance (or, if available, protein abundance) onto chromosomal location 75 and onto three-dimensional anatomical representations of tissue 76,77. However, truly integrated visualization of systems biology data across the entire range of possible data types is still very much in its infancy.
