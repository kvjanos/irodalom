Recently,	 the	 need	 to	 test	 cells	 and/or	 protein	 extracts	 for	 autophagic	 activity	 has	 increased,	 for	 example,	 to	 evaluate	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 RNAi	 or	 newly	 developed	 compounds.	 A	 variety	 of	 different	 methods	 are	 currently	 available,	 most	 of	 which	 have	 been	 extensively	 described	 in	 recent	 reviews.1-3	 Among	 them,	 LC3	 immunoblotting	 is	 the	most	widely	used.	Although	LC3	has	several	homologs	in	mammals,	LC3B	is	most	 commonly	used	for	autophagy	assays.	Endogenous	LC3	is	detected	as	two	bands	following	 SDS-PAGE	and	immunoblotting:	one	represents	LC3-I,	which	is	cytosolic,	and	the	other	 LC3-II,	which	is	conjugated	with	phosphatidylethanolamine	(PE)	and	is	present	on	isolation	membranes	and	autophagosomes,	and	much	less	on	autolysosomes.4,5	Nascent	LC3	 (proLC3),	which	is	neither	LC3-I	nor	LC3-II,	is	not	detected	under	normal	conditions	 because	 it	 is	 processed	 by	 Atg4	 into	 LC3-I	 immediately	 after	 synthesis.4	 Although	 the	 molecular	weight	of	LC3-II	is	larger	than	that	of	LC3-I	due	to	the	addition	of	PE,	LC3-II	 migrates	 faster	 than	 LC3-I	 in	 SDS-PAGE	 probably	 because	 of	 its	 extreme	 hydrophobicity.	 LC3	 conversion	 from	 LC3-I	 to	 LC3-II	 therefore	 represents	 PE-conjugation,	 not	 processing	of	LC3.	LC3-I	is	usually	detected	on	a	gel	at	a	molecular	mass	around	16	kD,	 and	LC3-II	at	approximately	14	kD.	The	amount	of	LC3-II	is	closely	correlated	with	the	 number	of	autophagosomes,	serving	as	a	good	indicator	of	autophagosome	formation.4	 However,	since	LC3-II	itself	is	degraded	by	autophagy,	LC3	immunoblotting	is	sometimes	 interpreted	 inappropriately.	 In	 this	 review,	 we	 discuss	 possible	 pitfalls	 and	 important	 cautions	regarding	LC3	immunoblot	analysis.	Cautions	related	to	LC3	microscopy	have	 been	described	elsewhere.6

Microtubule‑associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is now widely used to monitor autophagy. One approach is to detect LC3 conversion (LC3‑I to LC3‑II) by immunoblot analysis because the amount of LC3‑II is clearly correlated with the number of autopha‑ gosomes. However, LC3‑II itself is degraded by autophagy, making interpretation of the results of LC3 immunoblotting problematic. Furthermore, the amount of LC3 at a certain time point does not indicate autophagic flux, and therefore, it is important to measure the amount of LC3‑II delivered to lysosomes by comparing LC3‑II levels in the presence and absence of lysosomal protease inhibitors. Another problem with this method is that LC3‑II tends to be much more sensitive to be detected by immunoblotting than LC3‑I. Accordingly, simple comparison of LC3‑I and LC3‑II, or summation of LC3‑I and LC3‑II for ratio determinations, may not be appropriate, and rather, the amount of LC3‑II can be compared between samples.

This	effect	is	particularly	apparent	if	we	use	antibody	 generated	against	the	N-terminal	peptide	of	LC3	(Fig.	2).	A	similar	 phenomenon	has	also	been	observed	with	yeast	Atg8;	PE-conjugated	 Atg8	 is	 more	 sensitive	 to	 detection	 by	 anti-Atg8	 antibody,	 particularly	when	raised	against	its	N	terminus.19	Based	on	these	findings,	 it	is	now	believed	that	some	conformational	change	is	produced	at	 Figure 1.

This	 flux	 is	 more	 accurately	 comparison	of	the	amount	of	LC3-II	among	samples	is	likely	to	be	a	 represented	by	differences	in	the	amount	of	LC3-II	between	samples	 more	accurate	method. in	the	presence	and	absence	of	lysosomal	protease	inhibitors.	If	one	 does	 not	 have	 any	 other	 clear	 evidence	 of	 autophagic	 degradation,	 cAse sTudies (fig. 3) this	type	of	analysis	will	strengthen	the	data. Q1.	What	does	this	result	indicate? An	 alternative	 method	 for	 detecting	 the	 autophagic	 flux	 is	 A1.	 It	 indicates	 that	 the	 treatment	 causes	 either	 upregulation	 of	 measuring	 p62	 (SQSTM1/sequestosome	 1)	 degradation.10	 p62	 autophagosome	 formation	 or	 blockage	 of	 autophagic	 degradation.	 can	 bind	 LC3,	 thus	 serving	 as	 a	 selective	 substrate	 of	 autophagy.	 The	 level	 of	 p62	 decreases	 during	 starvation	 in	 wild-type	 MEFs,	 These	two	possibilities	cannot	be	distinguished	from	the	results	shown	 but	 not	 in	 Atg5-/-	 MEFs,11	 suggesting	 that	 the	 reduction	 is	 medi- in	this	part	of	the	panel.	The	increase	in	LC3-II	simply	indicates	the	 ated	 by	 autophagy.	 In	 addition,	 basal	 levels	 of	 p62	 are	 upregulated	 accumulation	of	autophagosomes,	but	does	not	guarantee	autophagic	 in	 Atg5-/-	 MEFs,	 indicating	 that	 accumulation	 of	 p62	 could	 be	 a	 degradation.

However,	 if	 the	 LC3-II	 autophagy.14-16	 Therefore,	 presentation	 of	 only	 p62	 data	 may	 not	 level	 were	 to	 remain	 unchanged,	 it	 is	 likely	 that	 autophagosome	 be	sufficient	to	estimate	the	autophagic	flux,	and	combination	with	 accumulation	occurred	due	to	inhibition	of	autophagic	degradation;	 for	example,	blockage	of	autophagosome-lysosome	fusion. other	methods	will	be	preferred. Q2.	Can	it	be	autophagy	defective? A2.	It	is	possible	that	these	cells	are	autophagy	defective	even	if	 iMMuNoreAcTiviTY of lc3‑i ANd lc3‑ii LC3-II	is	detected	under	any	conditions.

whether	 the	 cells	 are	 autophagy-defective	 or	 -competent	 (A2).	 Lysosomal	 protease	 inhibitor	 treatment	 should	 also	 be	 considered	 even	if	no	LC3-II	is	detected.	A	very	high	degradation	capacity	can	 lead	 to	 quick	 disappearance	 of	 LC3-II,	 which	 might	 be	 misunderstood	as	an	autophagy	defect. Q3.	Is	autophagy	activated	because	LC3-II	>	LC3-I? A3.	 No.	 As	 discussed	 above,	 LC3-II	 tends	 to	 be	 much	 more	 sensitive	in	immunoblotting	than	LC3-I,	further	depending	on	the	 antibody	used	as	shown	in	Figure	2.	As	a	result,	we	cannot	predict	 absolute	 autophagic	 activity	 simply	 by	 measuring	 the	 apparent	 amount	of	LC3-II	on	blots. Q4.	Are	the	“A”	cells	defective	in	autophagy? A4.	If	the	four	cell	groups	are	independently	cultured,	one	should	 be	very	careful	in	drawing	conclusions,	since	there	are	many	factors	 that	affect	autophagic	activity	and	LC3	conversion.	The	amount	of	 LC3-II	can	fluctuate	greatly	even	if	the	same	cell	line	is	cultured	in	 the	same	medium	with	identical	equipment.	Thus,	it	is	very	difficult	 to	 compare	 LC3-II	 amounts	 between	 cells	 that	 are	 independently	 cultured	for	long	period	of	time,	and,	accordingly,	even	if	a	single	cell	 line	is	used,	cells	should	be	split	shortly	(ideally	no	more	than	one	 day)	prior	to	processing	the	samples	for	the	LC3	conversion	assay.	To	 compare	autophagic	capacity,	it	would,	however,	be	better	to	analyze	 the	autophagic	flux	for	each	cell	line.
