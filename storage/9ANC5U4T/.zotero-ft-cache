Although used in academic research for several decades, 3D culture models have long been regarded expensive, cumbersome and unnecessary in drug development processes. Technical advances, coupled with recent observations showing that gene expression in 3D is much closer to clinical expression proﬁles than those seen in 2D, have renewed attention and generated hope in the feasibility of maturing organotypic 3D systems to therapy test platforms with greater power to predict clinical efﬁcacies. Here we describe a standardized setup for reproducible, easy-handling culture, treatment and routine analysis of multicellular spheroids, the classical 3D culture system resembling many aspects of the pathophysiological situation in human tumor tissue. We discuss essential conceptual and practical considerations for an adequate establishment and use of spheroid-based drug screening platforms and also provide a list of human carcinoma cell lines, partly on the basis of the NCI-DTP 60-cell line screen, that produce treatable spheroids under identical culture conditions. In contrast to many other settings with which to achieve similar results, the protocol is particularly useful to be integrated into standardized large-scale drug test routines as it requires a minimum number of deﬁned spheroids and a limited amount of drug. The estimated time to run the complete screening protocol described herein—including spheroid initiation, drug treatment and determination of the analytical end points (spheroid integrity, and cell survival through the acid phosphatase assay)—is about 170 h. Monitoring of spheroid growth kinetics to determine growth delay and regrowth, respectively, after drug treatment requires long-term culturing (Z14 d).

INTRODUCTION Over the past several years, various types of 3D culture systems have garnered much attention and gained increased recognition as important research tools. This trend has been illustrated, among others, in Alison Abbott’s 2003 Nature report entitled ‘Cell culture: biology’s new dimension’, which particularly emphasized the basic necessity for such systems before turning to whole-animal studies, for both basic research and therapeutic development1. Examples of 3D culture systems in use that show intermediate complexity reﬂecting particular aspects of tumor tissues include multilayer cell systems. These have been applied, for example, to study phenomena, such as drug transport and binding, therapy resistance and cell invasion. Matrix-embedded 3D cultures are increasingly applied to investigate differentiation, migration and invasion processes of tumor cells triggered by extracellular matrix compounds. Hollow-ﬁber-based approaches and ex vivo cultures of pieces or slices from tumors are also to be mentioned as advanced 3D culture systems but are not yet sufﬁciently well standardized and/or depend on the supply of primary tumor tissue, which can be challenging to obtain and limits routine application2,3. Continuing progress in testing natural and artiﬁcial matrices as well as 3D scaffolds, e.g., for tissue engineering purposes, has resulted in a number of critical improvements in reproducibility, ease of use and reliability of 3D model systems, with many obvious applications especially in cancer research. Some approaches have been discussed earlier with particular focus on the multicellular spheroid system as one of the models that has been characterized sufﬁciently well to say with conﬁdence that it simulates the pathophysiological milieu in a patient tumor showing similar therapy responses4–7. Multicellular spheroids are probably the most classical approach for 3D culturing, and multiple review articles throughout the past

three decades have highlighted the potential of this model system in cancer research and treatment2,7–10. Early investigations in the 1970s not only triggered the study of basic biological mechanisms in multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs), such as the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death processes, but also initiated the progressive entry of the MCTS model into various new ﬁelds of therapeutic interest. Today, there is an enormous body of literature on multicellular spheroids used in therapy-oriented studies, far too numerous to be discussed at length herein. However, it is worth noting that many of these studies have demonstrated the particular power of MCTSs to gain insight into therapeutic problems associated with metabolic and proliferative gradients, such as the altered responsiveness and effects of chronically hypoxic tumor cells, and the importance of 3D cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, e.g., in radio- and chemoresistance10,11–15. In fact, tumor cells grown as 3D structures can acquire some type of clinically relevant multicellular resistance to apoptosis-inducing drugs that may mimic the chemoresistance found in solid tumors16–19. Accordingly, experts in the ﬁeld have proposed to include MCTSs as mandatory models in major programs for drug screening and development and frequently alluded to the rationale for using MCTSs in antitumor drug testing2,7,20. In brief, MCTSs resemble avascular tumor nodules/micrometastases or intervascular regions of large solid tumors with respect to micromilieu, volume growth kinetics and some histomorphological features. They reestablish morphological, functional and mass transport properties of the corresponding tissue in vivo, with tumor cells restoring an in vivo-like differentiation pattern due to the appropriate 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly, complex

cell–matrix and cell–cell interactions and authentic pathophysiological milieu conditions. With increasing size, inward proliferation and oxygen/nutrient gradients are observed21, as well as a potential accumulation of catabolites in central regions, highly reminiscent of poorly vascularized areas in solid tumors. All these features affect cellular RNA and protein expression, the distribution and function of biomodulators and also the penetration, binding and bioactivity of therapeutic drugs and drug candidates. According to literature data, we expect many drug candidates to lose efﬁcacy in the 3D pathophysiological environment3,8,15,20. Here, spheroids will be a tool for negative selection and could (i) contribute critically to a reduction in animal testings and thus to economical savings and (ii) also become a powerful model to optimize drug candidates for enhanced tissue distribution and efﬁcacy. On the other hand, there is also experimental evidence that some drugs may exclusively be effective in 3D but not 2D culture, as has been seen in some target-speciﬁc treatment modalities, often with the molecular target being expressed only or particularly in a 3D environment18,22–29. Of course, drug candidates failing to show efﬁcacy in classical monolayer test assays but showing up active in a spheroid-based screen pose an interesting challenge for novel drug development offensives. To use the spheroid model as a supplement to monolayer-based assays with well-controlled intermediate complexity for advanced drug testing to better estimate in vivo antitumor efﬁcacy2,20,30, it is important to assure that the pathophysiological features of interest are indeed reﬂected. Some of these considerations, including the advantages and also the limitations of our protocol, are discussed further in the Experimental design. In general, implementation of the model into primary drug testing routines requires an experimental design that guarantees that spheroids cultured from the same cell type under the same external conditions are essentially identical in structure, morphology, microenvironment and cellular physiology. To allow the efﬁcient generation of a few up to several thousands of individual, identical cultures for screening purposes, for the performance both of single assays and multiple independent assay series, a well-deﬁned geometry is of course mandatory. An additional advantage of uniform geometry is the potential to relate structure to function, correlate spatial distributions or perform theoretical analyses2,20,30. Once data mining becomes feasible and necessary, on the basis of the accumulation of efﬁcacy data for reference substances and drug candidates, respectively, this will become both a challenge and an opportunity for optimizing drug design strategies, but this is clearly beyond the scope of this protocol. It is rather our intention to provide a list of critical considerations when establishing spheroid monocultures for therapy testing, present routine protocols with some technical improvements from our laboratory to monitor parameters of interest for an initial ‘spheroid-based screen’3,7 and caution against some of the basic and most frequently encountered pitfalls. Experimental design Although it may be impossible to achieve a general standardization of spheroid culturing and analysis for all experimental settings, the easy-handling protocols presented herein for highly reproducible spheroid culturing, volume analysis and cell viability assessment are expected to essentially contribute to the establishment of a ‘spheroidbased screen’ and to encourage scientists and the pharmaceutical industry to consider spheroids as part of the standard repertoire

for drug testing. However, before going into further detail with respect to the protocols applied in our laboratory, we intend to discuss some points of interest that have often been ignored but are critical when setting up spheroid-based assays. We do not intend to give a comprehensive review on different spheroid culture techniques nor will we discuss the more complex approaches, such as spheroid coculture systems, which have been established over the past 15 years to more closely resemble cellular heterogeneity in tumor tissues and which have included cell types as diverse as stromal ﬁbroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells7,9,31–35. These are indeed highly relevant and interesting model systems for academic work and should be considered for experimental drug testing. But the need to generate spheroids with uniform fractions and distributions of the different cell types as a prerequisite for a drug screening platform is a demanding challenge, and rapid, easy-handling analytical tools are not yet available2,7,9. Therefore, this protocol focuses on the culture, treatment and analysis of multicellular spheroid monocultures from established, commercially available human tumor cell lines and on routine approaches to evaluate spheroid formation capacity for noncommercial tumor cells or clones of interest. Some relevant considerations for the design of a large-scale spheroid-based drug screen are discussed. Tumor cell type of interest. The spheroid model is not equally relevant for all malignant diseases and scientiﬁc questions. For some types of nonsolid cancers, such as leukemia, lack of relevance of the spheroid monoculture model seems obvious, at least with respect to various pathophysiological parameters. Drug resistance phenotypes resulting from cell adhesion phenomena, however, may even be reﬂected for hematological malignancies36. For other tumor entities, speciﬁc questions are to be raised. With respect to melanoma, e.g., skin culture models are clearly the better approaches to reﬂect tumor cell behavior at the primary tumor location37–39, but spheroids may well reﬂect metastatic growth. They are preclinical models of avascular metastases and—provided the researcher is aware of the relevant limitations—they can prove useful for studying the nature of metastatic disease. Furthermore, they resemble intervascular microregions in carcinomas and sarcomas and have also been widely used as a model for brain tumors, in particular gliomas and glioblastomas. We recently tested all epithelial tumor cell lines of the NCI-DTP 60 cell-line panel for spheroid formation under identical conditions (Table 1). An extended list with other epithelial cell lines grown as spheroids, in addition to the ones tested by us, has been reported earlier7. Neither all primary tumor cells nor all established cell lines are capable of forming spheroids. Spheroid formation capacity has to be evaluated independent of the spheroid culture technique. Some tumor cells form spheres spontaneously in the absence of attachment to another substrate, even under stirred conditions. For those that do not aggregate, a period of culturing under steady-state conditions is recommended in standard approaches, such as the liquid overlay method. If a particular cell line does not form spheroids using standard spheroid culture technologies, including liquid overlay (for review, see refs. 7,37), but its use is nevertheless essential, the addition of ECM compounds, Methocel or reconstituted basement membrane according to Korff and Augustin40 or Ivascu and Kubbies41 can be considered. Although such ‘artiﬁcial’ matrices may allow obtaining spheroids from nonadherent and

drug sensitivity of cells under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we recommend the physiological range of 1 g literÀ1 (5 mM) glucose. It is also clear that some conditions cannot be mimicked well in vitro. However, within and between screens, the conditions should not vary for the cell lines used, as this would clearly complicate data analysis and interpretation. In our experimental setting, we have adapted all cell lines of interest to growth in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS). Spheroid size and culture time. The physiological state of spheroids clearly depends on the spheroid size, the individual and cell type–speciﬁc behavior of the tumor cells, the cell density within the spheroid and also directly or indirectly on the culture time. We intended to establish a spheroid-based screen with clear pathophysiological gradients but without central necroses at the onset of treatment. Owing to literature data and our own experience, a 4-d initiation interval for spheroid formation seemed reasonable and was found to reproducibly create spheroids of different cell types under identical culture conditions, reaching a standard size of 370–400 mm after 96 h of incubation at the onset of treatment. The culture of small spheroids with a size of up to 200 mm is frequently carried out for drug testing42–45 and may indeed be sufﬁcient to reﬂect 3D cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions but is clearly inappropriate when attempting to resemble pathophysiological conditions with hypoxic areas in the spheroid center or to develop proliferation gradients8,30,46,47. Hypoxia is not only a well-established direct radio- and drug- resistance factor, but it also leads to numerous indirect effects in tumor cells by modulating expression patterns, e.g., of HIF-1(a)-regulated genes. For example, it has been shown that growth of human breast cancer, human melanoma and murine breast cancer cell lines as multicellular spheroids lead to a reproducible downregulation of various DNA mismatch-repair genes48,49, an effect that may also be directly triggered by hypoxic conditions50. In spite of using spheroids with a size that is sufﬁcient to develop hypoxia in the center, approaches using small spheroids cultured under hypoxic conditions may thus be considered, keeping in mind of course that oxygen deﬁciency is only one of a number of pathophysiological parameters with therapeutic relevance. Large spheroids with a diameter between 500 and 600 mm develop central secondary necroses, which may be desired for some drug testing approaches but can be problematic in others. How relevant secondary necrosis is has to be determined for the intended application and for the particular tumor entities in vivo—see, e.g., the development of the so-called Comedo necroses in breast tumors. The possibility that such secondary necroses—both in vitro and in vivo—may develop through apoptosis has to be kept in mind as well20,22,51. Short-term cultures may not be as densely packed as those that formed over a longer period, they may not have endured lag phase after dissociation and seeding or may not yet express the entire authentic 3D pattern, e.g., with respect to extracellular matrix distribution and cell–cell/cell–matrix interactions52. Also, they may not show the same degree of chronic nutrient-deﬁciency characteristics. Molecules of interest should thus be carefully checked when short-term cultures of o48 h are used for testing.

eventually highly metastatic tumor cells, the occurrence of matrixdriven alterations in growth, expression proﬁle and behavior of the cells, including drug response, must be taken into consideration. However, such effects have not been systematically studied, and their in vivo relevance requires further examination. We highly recommend that all spheroid types in a screen should be grown under identical conditions. The primary ‘spheroid-based screen’ described herein was designed to not include any artiﬁcial supplements except for standard conditioned media and the coating to provide a nonadherent surface for liquid overlay. Similar to the case with monolayer cultures, many spheroid types are kept typically in different cell type–speciﬁc media to assure reasonable spheroid growth and maintain viability. This is, of course, undesirable for high-throughput screening purposes and also with respect to some pathophysiological features that should continue to be reﬂected properly in the model. Just as an example, differences in glucose supplementation may alter survival and/or

integration of this model system into routine drug testing. The various techniques for spheroid culturing have been described earlier, emphasizing their individual advantages and disadvantages7,8,10,37. It is noted that the spinner ﬂask technique remains the most appropriate for large-scale culturing and for maintaining spheroids under optimal supply conditions over a long period of time. One has to acknowledge, however, that rotating culture systems require relatively high quantities of media, conﬂicting with the usual demand for minimum amounts of new drug candidates to be applied in a drug test system. It may thus be necessary to transfer the spheroids to stationary spheroid culture systems, not only during drug exposure, but also for determining some of the analytical parameters, such as spheroid volume growth. Such transfer would not only disturb the cultures following treatment but also renders individual spheroid monitoring impossible. Stationary culturing technologies include the growth of spheroid cultures in nonadherent dishes, 96-well plates or as hanging drops. Whereas the ﬁrst approach results in the formation of multiple spheroids with a broad size range requiring further sorting and is thus not recommended for screening, the 96-well approach allows monitoring and manipulation of single and uniform spheroids. The hanging drop method is comparably sufﬁcient, but here drug treatment would require spheroid transfer that is counterproductive to large-scale screening. Problems with stationary culturing are primarily due to the more diffusion-limited conditions compared with rotary systems that affect the supply of nutrients and the pathophysiological situation in the spheroids throughout growth but may also alter drug distribution. The implementation of rotating platforms for 96-well plates might be useful to reduce this problem. Other critical points speciﬁcally relevant for drug testing in stationary cultures that may complicate interpretation of drug treatment studies have been discussed earlier7. Not surprisingly, drug treatment itself can affect the pathophysiological behavior, e.g., metabolic activity, of the cells, leading to secondary effects due to internally induced alterations in the nutrient environment. Such effects may be more pronounced in stationary than in stirred conditions. However, it has been speculated that similar alterations do occur in solid carcinomas due to their leaky, irregular and tortuous vascular system. In high-throughput test settings, some of the limitations of stationary culturing may be inevitable to minimize the amount of drug required. Owing to the need for analyzing and monitoring individual spheroids before and after treatment and to be able to apply small amounts of drugs, we chose the wellestablished liquid-overlay 96-well plate approach7,37,53 to set up the spheroid-based screen protocol. At present, none of the commercially available 96-well plates guarantees entirely reproducible spheroid culture for routine applications. We are continuously testing new plates from various distributors and manufacturers; any test plates are welcome in our laboratory. However, for now, plates with nonadherent surfaces are prepared routinely before spheroid culturing. Different coating strategies are described, such as the treatment of round-bottomed wells with 0.5% (wt/vol) poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (polyHEMA) in 95% ethanol41,54,55. Here, a centrifugation step to center the cells following inoculation may be advantageous for adequate spheroid formation. In our laboratory, the quality and reproducibility of spheroid formation and growth was still superior when using Agarose-coated ﬂat-bottomed wells. This may be due to individual handling, the poly-HEMA batches available or other
312 | VOL.4 NO.3 | 2009 | NATURE PROTOCOLS

variables. Individual, small-scale testing of poly-HEMA versus agarose coating might, however, be useful for special applications or if problems with certain cell lines or systems occur. Agarose diluted in medium forms a semisolid, nonadherent, concave surface that has proven to be appropriate for liquid overlay spheroid culturing more than 20 years ago53. It is hypothesized that the semisolid agar surface provides slightly better supply conditions than the bottom of a (coated) round-well plate, but this is still awaiting clear experimental evidence. Note: do-it-yourself coating of plates is obligatory for spheroid culturing, and coated plates should/can only be stored for a limited time (see also instructions below). Analytical end points. Many basic and complex methods have been used for the analysis of MCTSs, be they viable, ﬁxed or dissociated2,7,9. Today, all modern analytical tools, including molecular analyses, can be adapted to spheroid culture and may be considered if the analytical end point in a comparable monolayer system—such as a critical up- or downregulation of a particular gene, set of genes or protein—is well established. Colony formation assays to verify clonogenic survival are an established end point to verify drug efﬁcacy and radioresistance in monolayer cells and cultures, respectively. It has, however, become evident that the cell preparation protocol is a critical determinant for the analytical power of this end point. Accordingly, clonogenic survival assays have also been performed with single cells isolated from spheroids, e.g., following selective dissociation56–61, but such experimental setups are time intensive, require large amounts of spheroids and are thus not suitable for an initial spheroid-based screen. In addition, artiﬁcial cell loss due to the more difﬁcult dissociation procedure for 3D cultures, in particular after drug exposure, may become a major problem. Thus, the ﬁrst spheroid-based screen to evaluate drug efﬁcacy on a routine basis in our laboratory has been designed to cover the analytical end points: spheroid integrity, cell integrity and regrowth following treatment. Spheroid integrity can easily be visualized by (rapid) phasecontrast imaging, which is also the basis for recording spheroid volume growth kinetics. We have semiautomated this setting for single spheroid monitoring according to a protocol given below. As spheroid cell detachment directly after treatment may not necessarily result from (total) cell destruction and vice versa, microscopically intact spheroids may as well contain membrane-defect cells; there is no strong argument against the analysis of spheroid volume growth as a function of time. Indeed, spheroid growth delay is one of the supposed end points of interest that can most easily be determined. Various protocols have been used in the literature to calculate spheroid growth delay. Approaches range from linear and nonlinear correlation analyses of the spheroid volume kinetics considering deﬁned spheroid volume end points to the pure recording of time delay for spheroid regrowth after treatment62,63. The variable, nonuniform analysis in past reports has resulted in a dispute over the term ‘growth delay.’ On the basis of the spheroid diameter of 370–400 mm at the onset of drug treatment (average starting volume Vd4: (2.7–3.4) Â 107 mm3), our setting includes the documentation of the time required to reach ﬁve times Vd4, with the growth delay being calculated as the average time difference between treated and nontreated control spheroids. As spheroids after treatment may not show ‘normal’ tumor growth kinetics, e.g.,

according to a Gompertzian or equivalent function64–66, we do not routinely perform complex correlation analyses but record the ﬁrst day of the cultures to have a mean spheroid volume of Z5 Â Vd4 as rapid estimate. This is useful if, as in the case of new drug candidates, pronounced but not minor effects are to be assessed. In addition, the individual spheroid regrowth is recorded, and the proportion of spheroids to reach 5 Â Vd4 is monitored as a function of time. This approach allows estimation of a 50% spheroid control concentration or dose according to the tumor control dose (TCD50) known from irradiation experiments. Spheroid volume (re)growth is a primary analytical end point. However, it requires long-term culturing, and it is desirable also to have a more immediate measure for cell survival directly after treatment. We have recently established an easy-handling protocol to use the acid phosphatase assay (APH) for cell integrity and viability assessment in single spheroids3. The assay is simple, rapid and high-throughput compatible, as it does not require spheroid dissociation. It has been described to be linear and highly sensitive over a large cell concentration range for two well-established colorectal cancer spheroid types, and the results can directly be compared with respective data from monolayer cultures using the same assay. Similar systematic experiments for other simple assays are not documented in the literature, although various groups have applied cell viability or cytotoxicity assays in spheroids42,67,68. As we found several of the classical cell viability and cytotoxicity assays not to be applicable to spheroid cultures with varying sizes, we highly recommend to not blindly apply any monolayer assay system but to check the validity of the assay of choice or to use the APH approach described herein. Thymidine incorporation assays may also be useful, as they primarily reﬂect proliferative activity, but were not considered due to the more complex handling of radioactive material. In our laboratory, IC50 values estimated from doseresponse curves determined through APH cell viability assessment are used as one analytical end point for drug testing. The capacity for spheroid outgrowth in 3D matrices or on adherent, ECM coated or noncoated surfaces, has been described previously as an interesting parameter to describe the migratory behavior of spheroid cells69,70. However, this is valid only if short incubation intervals of less than one cell cycle are considered or if cell cycle progression is chemically inhibited. Unfortunately, the latter may interfere with drug efﬁcacy and should be avoided. Therefore, the approach is particularly useful only for rapidly migrating cells, e.g., in glioma or glioblastoma spheroids70. We have established a high-throughput compatible process to transfer and center single spheroids from agarose-coated into ECM-coated 96-well plates and to semiautomatically analyze spheroid outgrowth. However, for many but not all colorectal cancer spheroid types, outgrowth is seen exclusively over a longer period of time (3– 5 d), which does not allow clear discrimination of the effects of a drug on cell adherence, migration or proliferation. The test parameter ‘outgrowth’ is thus not considered as a primary analytical end point for routine monitoring in the spheroid-based screen and will not be discussed further in this protocol. Additional methodological considerations. Three types of controls should be considered for a spheroid-based drug test system: (i) spheroid, (ii) treatment and (iii) analytical controls. Spheroid control means that a well-established and characterized spheroid type is routinely included in the experimental setup. We use HT29 spheroids as a standard. Drugs that are already in clinical use either for a speciﬁc tumor entity or with broader efﬁcacy can serve as treatment controls. Such drugs may be 5-ﬂuorouracil or irinotecan, e.g., for colorectal cancers, and also paclitaxel, cisplatin or even doxorubicin (adriamycin), which has the advantage of being ﬂuorescent and thus can be useful as a control for drug penetration studies56,71,72. Analytical controls, e.g., cell-free medium, dead cell and drug solvent controls and others, are depicted for our speciﬁc procedure in the respective paragraphs.

Standard medium can be stored at 4 1C for up to 2 weeks. Trypsin/EDTA working solution Phosphate-buffered saline is applied to dilute the trypsin/EDTA stock solution to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) trypsin and 0.02% (wt/vol) EDTA. The working solution can be stored at À20 1C for up to 1 year. Drugs and drug candidates Prepare appropriate stock solutions of drugs and drug candidates, respectively, and store at conditions required to keep optimum drug activity. In our ﬁrst standard spheroid-based screen, ﬁnal drug concentration ranged from 0.01 to 200 mM, but some drug candidates are efﬁcient at much lower concentrations. For most but not all drugs in our laboratory, 100 mM stock solutions in DMSO and storage at À20 1C for up to 2 weeks are suitable. APH assay buffer The assay buffer to assess APH activity contains 0.1 M sodium acetate (3 M stock solution, pH 5.2) and 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in deionized/destilled H2O and can be stored at 4 1C for up to 4 weeks. The substrate solution is prepared by supplementing the assay buffer with 2 mg mlÀ1 ImmunoPure p-nitrophenyl phosphate (ﬁnal pH 4.8) immediately before use. m CRITICALThe substrate solution should always be freshly prepared and not be exposed to light. EQUIPMENT SETUP Tumor cells Various epithelial tumor cell lines of different origin are known to form spherical cultures7. Not all of these can be applied in a spheroid-based screen. Diverse considerations have been discussed above. The ﬁrst spheroidbased drug screen for multiple cell lines has been designed to exclusively monitor drug efﬁcacy in colorectal cancer cell spheroids. All of these lines are commercially available (Table 1), can be cultured as monolayer and spheroid cultures in standard medium and transferred using the same trypsin/EDTA working solution. HT29 and HCT-116 are the routine cell lines in our platform. All stocks have been tested to be free of mycoplasms, are frozen in a 90% FCS plus 10% (vol/vol) DMSO solution and are stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent reculturing. Agarose-coated 96-well plates Add 0.15 g of agarose to 10 ml of DMEM (1.5% (wt/vol)) in appropriate beaker, seal with aluminum foil or lid and autoclave for 20 min at 120 1C, 2 bar.

The system shown allows the preparation of 30 plates at a time that are hermetically sealed after cooling off. to keep beakers with agarose in a preheated waterbath on heating plate at about 60 1C. Add 50 ml to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (ﬂat bottomed) under sterile conditions using a manual precision dispenser. The agarose solidiﬁes within seconds to minutes. A volume of 50 ml agarose is appropriate to produce a concave surface and is a convenient choice to allow the addition of 200 ml of cell suspension and supernatant, respectively. Let plates with agarose cool down to room temperature (B20 min) and repack plates. Plates can be used for up to about 10 d after preparation if hermetically sealed, stored at room temperature and protected from light. m CRITICAL Amounts less than 50 ml may not entirely cover the surface before solidifying. Phase-contrast imaging: AxioVision 4.5 software In collaboration with Zeiss AG, we established semiautomated measurement protocols to determine diameters and volumes from spheroid phase-contrast images using speciﬁc modules in the AxioVision 4.5 software (Zeiss, Germany). The following parameters are recorded: spheroid area, mean spheroid diameter, spheroid volume, minimum diameter, maximum diameter, circularity and image name.

3| To generate spheroids of 400-mm diameter at day 4 after i inoculation in liquid overlay culture37,53, dilute dissociated cells from stock cultures to appropriate concentrations in standard medium, e.g., 7,500 cells mlÀ1 for HT29 and 3,750 cells mlÀ1 for HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells. m CRITICAL STEP For each tumor cell line, the cell number needed to create spheroids of 370–400 mm in diameter at day 4 after initiation (see Step 6) has to be determined in preliminary tests using appropriate dissociation means to produce single cell suspensions. In our setup, spheroid formation is routinely checked by phase-contrast microscopy for cell concentrations ranging from 2.5 Â 103 to 6 Â 104 cells mlÀ1 (as described in Step 6 ). A representative example of one cell type from the NCI-DTP 60 cell line panel tested is shown in Figure 3. Reproducibility is then checked twice, 3D sphericity is evaluated, and spheroid characteristics of interest, e.g., the number of cells per spheroid, at the respective diameter are documented. 4| Use a manual eight-channel pipettor or an automated multichannel pipetting system, such as the SerialMate to transfer 200 ml of the cell suspension into each well of an agarose-coated microtiter plate (1,500 HT29 and 750 HCT-116 cells per well, respectively). Application of an automated multichannel pipetting system (Fig. 2) may optimize spheroid formation by reducing variability due to individual handling during seeding. The standard deviation (s.d.) of HT 29 spheroid diameters at day 4 after seeding is reproducibly below 5% in one 96-well plate and one experimental 96-well plate series, respectively, and less than 10% between different experiments. ? TROUBLESHOOTING 5| Incubate plates for 96 h in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at 37 1C. m CRITICAL STEP Avoid agitation during initiation interval. ? TROUBLESHOOTING 6| After 96 h of incubation (day 4 after intiation of spheroids), image each well of the 96-well plate with a phase-contrast microscope using a Â10 or Â5 objective to monitor and analyze spheroid integrity, diameter and volume. An automated Zeiss Axiovert200/M-based system is used for this purpose in our laboratory. Spheroid analysis is performed through image processing algorithms implemented in the AxioVision 4.5 Software (Zeiss), which allows reliable and reproducible area selection to determine spheroid diameter and volume (Fig. 2).

Drug treatment TIMING Working time 1 h; incubation time 72 h 7| For spheroid and monolayer treatment, respectively, dilute drugs or drug stock solutions in standard medium at 2Â ﬁnal concentration immediately before usage. As reference for nontreated control cells and spheroids, standard medium containing the respective solvent, e.g., DMSO, according to the concentration present in the lowest drug dilution (2 Â 200 mM) is prepared. m CRITICAL STEP Note that DMSO concentrations of o0.5% are not expected to affect spheroid growth. Slight effects may already be seen at a concentration of 0.5–1%, depending on the cell type and culture condition. A proportion of 41% DMSO in the drug dilution for treatment should be avoided. Other solvents are to be veriﬁed. Individual solvent controls for each drug concentrations may be considered. 8| Treat spheroid cultures by replacing 50% (¼100 ml) of supernatant with drug-supplemented standard medium using a manual 8-channel pipettor or the SerialMate automated multichannel pipetting system. In parallel, replace medium of untreated reference cells and spheroids with solvent-containing or solvent-free standard medium. In our setup, 8–16 spheroids are treated and analyzed per condition and drug concentration, respectively. m CRITICAL STEP Spheroid symmetry (sphericity) should be checked in control untreated spheroids before using a new spheroid type for routine drug testing. In some instances, it may be recommended to also monitor 3D spherical structure following treatment, e.g., if spheroids grow much larger than expected and/or become transparent. ? TROUBLESHOOTING 9| Incubate cultures for a deﬁned treatment interval (in our case for 72 h) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at 37 1C. Determination of cell viability using the acid phosphotase assay TIMING 2–3 h 10| The APH assay proved useful to determine cell viability in monolayer and spheroid cultures3. As we routinely determine drug effects in monolayer cultures in parallel to spheroid cultures, the APH assay procedure for monolayer cells shall also be described herein. The assay procedure differs for monolayer cultures (option A) and MCTSs (option B). (A) APH assay on monolayer cultures (i) Prepare monolayer cells for every test as follows: plate 600 exponentially growing monolayer cells in 200 ml of standard medium per well of a 96-well microtiter plate (ﬂat bottomed) and incubate for 4 d in humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at 37 1C. Treat monolayer cells according to the instructions for spheroid cultures described in the previous section (Steps 6–8). (ii) After treatment, wash monolayer cultures by carefully replacing the 200 ml of supernatant with PBS. (iii) Repeat wash step and add 100 ml of PBS per well. (iv) Add 100 ml of APH assay buffer to each well and incubate for 90 min at 37 1C in an incubator. ? TROUBLESHOOTING (v) Following incubation, add 10 ml of 1 N NaOH to each well. (vi) Measure absorption at 405 nm within 10 min on a microplate reader. ? TROUBLESHOOTING

(B) APH assay on MCTSs (i) Analyze sphericity, spheroid integrity and diameter of MCTSs grown in liquid overlay for 7 d (initiation period of 4 d plus treatment interval of 72 h), i.e., from Step 10, through phase-contrast imaging before APH assaying. m CRITICAL STEP 10% Triton X-100 in standard medium can be used as ultimate (positive) control to induce complete loss of cell membrane integrity of all cells in structurally intact spheroids with an incubation interval of 2 h before APH assaying. (ii) Carefully transfer MCTSs and entire supernatant with cells into standard ﬂat-bottomed 96-well microplates with a manual eight-channel pipettor. m CRITICAL STEP Note that APH assays are routinely performed with 8–16 spheroids per condition and treatment modality. Most experiments are repeated twice, except for rapid, preliminary concentration screening. Application of an automated pipettor is envisioned upon assay scale-up. (iii) Centrifuge for 10 min at RT at B400g to spin down spheroids, clusters and single cells. (iv) Wash spheroid/cell pellet by carefully replacing 160 ml of the supernatant with PBS. m CRITICAL STEP Be sure not to lose any cell material. (v) Repeat centrifugation and discard supernatant to a ﬁnal volume of 100 ml. (vi) Add 100 ml of APH assay buffer to each well and incubate for 90 min at 37 1C in an incubator. ? TROUBLESHOOTING (vii) Following incubation, supplement each well with 10 ml of 1 N NaOH. (viii) Measure absorption at 405 nm within 10 min on a microplate reader. ? TROUBLESHOOTING Determination of spheroid integrity and volume growth kinetics TIMING Working time 1 h per drug every 2 d over a period of Z14 d 11| Culture spheroids in liquid overlay and treat as detailed earlier (Steps 1–9). For studies on spheroid growth delay/regrowth, replace 50% of the supernatant by fresh, standard medium after the treatment interval and every 48 h thereafter. m CRITICAL STEP To avoid spheroid cell loss or disruption, supernatant cannot be removed completely even after treatment. In most applications, we accept replacement of 50% of the supernatant leading to a 1:2 dilution of the remaining drug and residual drug activity, respectively, which is then consecutively diluted throughout further culturing, i.e., with every medium refreshment. The incubation period is thus not as clearly deﬁned as for the APH assay setting at least for those drugs that are still highly active after 72 h at 37 1C. Approaches to adapt and eventually optimize this setting for semiautomated test routines are discussed, and some basic tests are underway. Sequential treatment is, of course, also feasible but unlikely in a primary screen/test system. 12| Collect phase-contrast images of all individual spheroids before drug treatment (day 4 in culture), after 72 h of treatment (day 7 in culture) and at least every 48 h thereafter either manually or automated, e.g., on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 or automated Zeiss Axiovert 200 M equipped with camera systems and workstations. 13| Monitor and analyze spheroid integrity, diameter and volume semiautomatically at any given time from images taken with Â5 or Â10 objective, respectively, using appropriate software modules, e.g., in the AxioVision 4.5 software (Fig. 2). 14| Routinely transfer list of data into worksheet (e.g., in Excel) or speciﬁc databank (not yet commercially or freely available) for subsequent spheroid data analysis, and plot mean spheroid volume as a function of time on a semilogarithmic scale to visualize spheroid volume growth kinetics and to evaluate spheroid growth delay after treatment. ? TROUBLESHOOTING 15| As potential analytical end point, determine the time delay and the proportion of treated spheroids versus nontreated spheroids to reach the spheroid volume ﬁve times higher than the starting volume at day 4 after initiation (5 Â Vd4), i.e., spheroid volume at the onset of treatment, and also record the ﬁrst day of spheroid regrowth following treatment if possible (see also Experimental design) m CRITICAL STEP The spheroid volume 5 Â Vd4 is valid for all spheroid types reaching diameters of Z700 mm under standard conditions. For some practical reasons not discussed herein, the maximum spheroid volume is a poor analytical end point in liquid overlay culture. ? TROUBLESHOOTING TIMING A time table with day 0 deﬁned as the day of cell seeding for spheroid initiation is given in Figure 4. ? TROUBLESHOOTING Troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.

Unsuitable storage of agarose-coated 96-well microplates

Plates can be stored under various conditions, e.g., at 4 1C in a fridge or at 37 1C in an incubator. We experienced reduced reproducibility of spheroid formation with such approaches and therefore recommend hermetically sealed, light-protected storage at room temperature (20–24 1C). This procedure sufﬁciently protects against dehydration over the storage period. Another option would be the coverage of agarose with small amounts of medium Always provide optimal single cell suspensions for cell seeding Avoid or get rid of cell doublets and clusters by adapting the enymatic and mechanic means and modalities used for cell dissociation, ﬁlter cell suspension through 30–35 mm sterile meshes, and/or use ﬁne needle aspiration Use standardized cell quality assessment settings to guarantee cell viability Exclusively apply cell suspensions from exponentially growing, nonsenescent cells Do not use different batches of serum Check serum quality for spheroid formation and growth before routine use; reserve adequate quantities of the same batch Heat-inactivate serum (56 1C, 20–25 min) even if some of the activity is lost If serum aliquots are frozen for storage, avoid repetitive thawing See above See above (continued)

Poor quality of agarose-coated plates or inadequately dissociated single cell suspensions Incorrect incubation conditions or medium supplementation

Check incubator settings and media For large-scale experiments, addition of HEPES as buffer supplement to the medium (10–25 mM) is highly recommended to avoid critical variations in the pH during spheroid monitoring and feeding procedures Check and optimize incubator functions and settings, including water level and CO2 content

Spheroids in margin wells are smaller

Inhomogeneous incubation conditions (e.g., with respect to humidiﬁed atmosphere leading to increased medium evaporation in outer wells) Eventually, insufﬁcient sealing of agarose-coated plates during storage leading to some quality loss in the peripheral wells

See above Note: we found spheroids in the left and right wells (columns 1 and 12) to be more frequently affected than others, although other spheroids in lanes A and H are in line with those on the rest of the plate. At present, our strategy for drug treatment is thus to routinely neglect data from spheroids in columns 1 and 12 but to ﬁll these wells with cell suspensions and/or media anyhow Check cleanness of beakers and of any other reusable glass or plastic materials Use one-way materials Monitor media and media supplements and ﬁlter supplemented media through sterile ﬁlter if required Carefully aliquot heat-inactivated serum to omit solid particles See Experimental design. Always check sphericity of new spheroid types not only in phasecontrast images (x–y direction), but also in z-direction, e.g., by individual macroscopic monitoring during manipulation and manual transfer of spheroids and/or through histological processing and sectioning (continued)

Spheroid-based test protocol: liquid overlay in agarose-coated 96-well plates; seeding density 1.5 Â 103 HT29 colon cancer cells per well in 200 ml of FCS-conditioned DMEM standard medium; initiation interval, 4 d; mean spheroid size at day 4 (onset of treatment), 370–400 mm; 72 h treatment interval. Graph shows relative cell viability in monolayer and spheroid cultures after 72 h of treatment with irinotecan. Data points are means ± standard deviation (s.d.) relative to untreated controls from one experiment with n ¼ 8 individual spheroids per condition. IC50 values were calculated to emphasize the difference of drug efﬁcacy in 2D versus 3D culture. Dose–response curves were recorded in three independent experimental series showing high reproducibility as shown in ref. 30. For the particular experiment presented herein, representative phasecontrast images are documented to capture spheroid integrity and volume following treatment at the time of cell survival assessment (magniﬁcation Â10 objective).

spheroids. In experiments throughout the past years, a total number of 8–16 spheroids per condition was found to be sufﬁcient for evaluating cell survival after drug treatment and to calculate IC50 values from dose–response curves such as the one documented in Figure 5 for the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (Toronto Research Chemicals TRC Inc.). The assay is simple and high-throughput compatible and shall be increasingly used to examine drug effects in spheroid cultures. In all cases, exponential monolayer cultures can serve as reference. The assay, however, is a one-state measurement and does not reﬂect clonogenic survival. Hence, combination with spheroid integrity and volume monitoring (Fig. 6), e.g., through phase-contrast imaging, is most useful. Data should be collected, and databases akin to the NCI-DTP 60 cell-line screen should become available to provide clear evidence that the spheroid model is able to aid in a better selection of clinically relevant drugs. It is noted that the protocol allows signiﬁcant basic screening but is not sufﬁcient to identify the mechanisms leading to alterations in drug efﬁcacy in 3D versus 2D culture. Limitations in drug penetration, contact-dependent multidrug resistence phenomena and oxygen deﬁciency are just three of the parameters inﬂuencing drug effects. Gene and protein expression modiﬁed by the 3D environment are further features that affect and potentially reﬂect treatment outcome. Indeed, in addition to the biochemical and histological advantages of tumor spheroids over traditional 2D culture as a cancer model, it is worth reiterating that there is increasing evidence that overall gene expression patterns in spheroids are more similar to those observed in real tumor samples25,73–75. Moreover, reﬁned methods for monitoring a number of additional clinically relevant parameters have, in recent years, shown intriguing parallels between spheroid systems and authentic tumor samples. These include speciﬁc as well as overall gene expression differences in different tissue layers using reporter assays76–78 as well as novel approaches to modeling drug distribution in vivo71,79,80. Furthermore, elegant studies to relate drug resistance phenomena in tumor tissue to these in cultured spheroids18,34,81,82 have shown impressive similarities as well. Among other things, expression patterning may thus provide relevant mechanistic insight in the action of promising drug candidates, e.g., those identiﬁed through the basic screen. Additional research is required to improve cell-line–based screens or extend our protocol to the use of primary tumor material. A particularly intriguing focus is the study of cell populations with cancer stem cell potential. Recent work indicates that tumor-initiating cell/cancer stem cell populations—to retain their stem cell characteristics in culture—may have to be

Spheroid-based test protocol according to Figure 5; routine 72 h treatment interval without medium renewal followed by 50% medium exchange every 48 h for further culturing. Every feeding step results in a consecutive 1:2 dilution of the drug. Graph visualizes spheroid volume growth kinetics of HT29 spheroids in liquid overlay culture and evaluation of the parameter growth delay/regrowth as additional analytical end point of interest. Here growth delay is deﬁned as the time lag of treated versus nontreated cultures to reach the quintuple spheroid volume of day 4 (5 Â Vd4; Vd4 ¼ spheroid volume at onset of treatment). Data points are mean spheroid volumes ± s.d. from 8 r n r 16 spheroids. *HT29 spheroid growth delay treated with 10 mM irinotecan was about 14 d. **24 d after initial drug exposure spheroids treated with 100 mM irinotecan started to regrow.

propagated as spheroids (or spheres). Examples from the literature providing evidence for the existence of tumor-initiating cell/cancer stem cell populations in solid tumors include entities as diverse as glioblastomas, breast, renal, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric and colorectal cancers83–88. If the cancer stem cell hypothesis proves true, including the assumption that this subpopulation of cells shows higher treatment resistance or survival capacity in particular pathophysiological niches, this observation will have a clear and important impact on future experimental work, including the development of new, target-speciﬁc drugs.
