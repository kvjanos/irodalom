Imaging and Analysis of Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Models
Benedikt W. Graf and Stephen A. Boppart
Abstract
Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures are important tools in cell biology research and tissue engineering because they more closely resemble the architectural microenvironment of natural tissue, compared to standard two-dimensional cultures. Microscopy techniques that function well for thin, optically transparent cultures, however, are poorly suited for imaging 3D cell cultures. Three-dimensional cultures may be thick and highly scattering, preventing light from penetrating without signiﬁcant distortion. Techniques that can image thicker biological specimens at high resolution include confocal microscopy, multiphoton microscopy, and optical coherence tomography. In this chapter, these three imaging modalities are described and demonstrated in the assessment of functional and structural features of 3D chitosin scaffolds, 3D micro-topographic substrates from poly-dimethyl siloxane molds, and 3D Matrigel cultures. Using these techniques, dynamic changes to cells in 3D microenvironments can be non-destructively assessed repeatedly over time. Key words: 3D culture, optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy.

1. Introduction
Culturing cells on two-dimensional (2D) substrates has been a standard technique in cell biology research for decades. However, the culture ﬂasks and dishes typically used do not replicate the natural microenvironment of cells in tissue. Research has shown that the extracellular environment has a profound impact on cell biology, including differentiation of stem cells (1, 2). As a result, there has been an increased interest in developing culturing techniques that more closely resemble natural tissue. Many different types of three-dimensional (3D) cultures and 3D scaffold materials have

been developed. A commonly used substance, Matrigel, is derived from the extra cellular matrix (ECM) of mouse tumor (sarcoma). Other techniques are based on seeding cells in porous 3D scaffolds constructed with synthetic materials. Three-dimensional cell cultures have become important for both research and clinical applications, with one goal being the development of advanced biocompatible engineered tissues (3, 4). While 3D cell cultures more accurately model the natural environment of cells, their use also presents new challenges. Many of the tools used to visualize live cells in 2D cell cultures such as bright ﬁeld and phase microscopy rely on light transmitted through the sample. These approaches are impractical for viewing cells in 3D cultures since the whole sample may be too thick for light to effectively pass through. For visualizing 3D cultures and thick tissue samples non-destructively, imaging techniques that rely on epi-illumination (with light collected in the backward direction) are more suitable. Different epi-illumination imaging techniques exist and can be based on the detection of ﬂuorescence as well as backscattered light. Fluorescence-based techniques are most commonly used to visualize a ﬂuorescent marker that has been targeted to a speciﬁc area or molecule of interest. Alternatively, the autoﬂuorescent properties of cells and tissues can frequently provide sufﬁcient contrast to identify structural and biochemical components. Imaging techniques based on the scattering of light are commonly used to observe the structural and dimensional characteristics of a sample. For example, by measuring the wavelength-dependent scattering properties of the sample, one can infer the sizes of the scatterers present, such as the size of individual cells or nuclei. Confocal microscopy (CM) is an imaging technique that is capable of high resolution optical sectioning in relatively thick samples and can be used both in ﬂuorescence as well as reﬂectance mode (see Note 1). The penetration depth of confocal microscopy is limited to roughly less than 100 m (5). Deeper penetration depths for ﬂuorescence imaging can be achieved by using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This technique relies on non-linear optical effects and can perform high resolution optical sectioning in samples up to a millimeter thick, depending on tissue type (6). Scattering-based imaging with penetration depths of up to several millimeters can be achieved by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (7). OCT constructs depth-resolved images by using interferometric techniques to measure the time-of-ﬂight of scattered photons. Determining which imaging technique is appropriate for a speciﬁc 3D cell culture depends on the optical properties, type, and thickness of the culture, as well as the features of interest in the culture. Some of the imaging techniques described here can be used simultaneously, which provides a more comprehensive view of a sample based on differing

contrast-enhancing mechanisms. Since these imaging techniques have little effect on the viability of living cells, they are well-suited for observing dynamic changes in 3D cell cultures. This chapter will focus on imaging techniques for assessing cells grown in different 3D cultures. Optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy, and confocal microscopy are used to visualize structural and functional properties of the samples. OCT and CM are used to observe the location and functional activity of cells over a period of several days in a chitosin scaffold. OCT and MPM are used to obtain high-resolution images of cells seeded on 3D micro-topographic substrates, as well as in 3D cultures using Matrigel as a scaffold material. The effect of mechanical stimuli on the cells in these cultures is also observed. Understanding the principles and limitations of confocal microscopy, multiphoton microscopy, and optical coherence tomography is essential when choosing the appropriate technique for imaging a speciﬁc type of 3D culture, scaffold, or substrate. The most important parameters to consider for imaging 3D cultures are the optical contrast mechanism (ﬂuorescence or scattering), the resolution, and the penetration depth. CM, MPM, and OCT instruments are all commercially available, but can also be constructed in a lab that is equipped with sufﬁcient optical hardware components.
1.1. Confocal Microscopy

Confocal microscopy is a high resolution imaging technique that enables optical sectioning of non-transparent samples. There are several types of CM but the technique that has gained the most widespread use in the life sciences is confocal laser scanning microscopy. This technique is based on point illumination of the sample with a laser, and spatial ﬁltering of the returning beam with a pinhole to block light from outside the focus. The beam is scanned across the sample and an image is constructed. CM can be used in both ﬂuorescence mode as well as reﬂectance mode. Spatial resolution in CM depends on the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, the pinhole size, and the wavelength of the light. Sub-micrometer resolution can be achieved with commercial systems allowing even the smallest cells and sub-cellular features to be visualized. Penetration depth in thick samples is limited by the fact that scattering in the sample causes the illuminating beam to defocus. This will decrease the amount of light that passes through the pinhole as the imaging depth becomes deeper, effectively limiting the imaging depth. The penetration depth also depends on the optical properties of the sample, the NA of the objective, and wavelength of the light source. Generally, longer wavelength light penetrates deeper in a sample due to less absorption and scattering. Fluorescence CM typically uses shorter wavelength (visible) light to excite commercial ﬂuorophores through absorption. Reﬂectance CM does not have stringent wavelength

requirements and can readily be performed with longer wavelength light sources to improve penetration depth (8). Ongoing research is developing newer ﬂuorescence-based probes or dyes that are excited by near-infrared wavelengths. The deepest penetration depth achievable with CM is typically limited to less than 100 m (9, 10).

1.2. Multiphoton Microscopy

Multiphoton microscopy is a high-resolution ﬂuorescence imaging technique that has at least a twofold improvement in penetration depth over confocal microscopy (11). It is based on nonlinear optical processes that absorb two or more near-infrared photons and subsequently emit a single photon in the visible range. It is most commonly used to excite exogenous ﬂuorescent dyes or probes through two-photon absorption. This process requires a high intensity of photons in both time and position (see Note 2). This is typically accomplished using a laser with ultra-short pulse duration (such as a titanium-sapphire laser) and a high numerical aperture objective. The high intensity requirement restricts the two-photon absorption to within the focal volume. This results in a high spatial resolution without the need for spatial ﬁltering. In addition, MPM reduces photobleaching since ﬂuorescence excitation is limited to a small volume (12). Because near-infrared wavelengths are used to excite the ﬂuorescent molecules, imaging penetration is signiﬁcantly better than CM, and there is little absorption or thermal effects. As a result, MPM is preferable to CM for imaging 3D cell cultures or tissue when they are thick or highly scattering.

1.3. Optical Coherence Tomography

Optical coherence tomography is a technique which is capable of obtaining high resolution scattering-based images of thick tissue samples (7, 13). OCT operates by focusing light from a broad bandwidth light source into a sample and determining the time it takes for the light to return to a detector. The echo time-ofﬂight information is used to determine the depth in the sample from where light was scattered. OCT is similar in principle to ultrasound imaging except that near-infrared light is used instead of acoustic waves. Compared to clinical ultrasound, OCT has a higher resolution but a shallower penetration depth. Because the speed of light is signiﬁcantly faster than the speed of acoustic waves, the time information must be measured indirectly using interferometry. Light scattered from the sample is combined with a reference beam and the resulting interference pattern is measured. The interference pattern contains the time-of-ﬂight information of the light in the sample arm. Light scattered from different depths can be distinguished because of the low coherence property of the laser or light source. Cross-sectional OCT images

are constructed by scanning the laser beam across the sample and acquiring depth-dependent scattering proﬁles at each position. The setup of an OCT system can be divided into four parts: source, sample arm, reference arm, and detector arm. The source is commonly a near-infrared laser or superluminescent diode with a broad spectral bandwidth. The beam from the source is split by a beam splitter into the reference arm and the sample arm. Light reﬂected from the sample and the reference arm recombine at the beam splitter and is directed to the detector. The sample arm consists of focusing optics (which also function as collecting optics), the sample, and a mechanism for scanning the beam or the sample. The arrangement of the reference arm and the detection arm is dependent on the detection scheme being used. There are two basic schemes, time-domain OCT and frequency-domain OCT. Time-domain OCT consists of a single detector and mechanism for rapidly scanning the delay in the reference arm. At each delay of the reference arm, scattering from a speciﬁc depth in the sample can be determined. Frequency-domain OCT is performed by using a ﬁxed reference arm path and measuring the spectral interference pattern in the detector arm. The entire depth-scattering proﬁle can be obtained by taking one measurement of the spectrum and computing the inverse Fourier transform. Frequencydomain OCT does not require any mechanical scanning in the reference arm, which results in signiﬁcantly improved speed and sensitivity (14). Frequency-domain OCT is further sub-divided into two categories: spectral (or Fourier) domain OCT and sweptsource OCT (see Note 3). In spectral-domain OCT the spectrum of the broad bandwidth light source is measured using a spectrometer (15). In swept-source OCT the wavelength of a tunable laser is rapidly swept over the bandwidth (16). The broad spectrum is thus encoded in time and a single detector is used instead of a spectrometer. A simpliﬁed schematic of a spectral-domain OCT system is shown in Fig. 13.1 to better demonstrate the principles of OCT. Resolution in the axial and transverse directions is decoupled in OCT. Axial resolution is governed by the coherence length of the light source which is inversely dependent on the spectral bandwidth. Axial resolution in a typical OCT system is less than 10 microns. Transverse resolution is dictated by the optics used to focus the beam onto the sample. Transverse resolution for a typical OCT system is around 10 m as well, so a large confocal parameter, or depth-of-focus, can be achieved. Just as with CM and MPM, imaging depth for OCT is highly dependent on the optical properties of the sample as well as the wavelength of the source. Penetration depth can be up to several millimeters, even in highly scattering samples, because OCT not only spatially ﬁlters out-of-focus light as in CM but also coherently rejects photons that are not singly backscattered from points in the tissue and

Fig. 13.1. Schematic of a spectral/Fourier-domain OCT system. The beam from the broad bandwidth light source is split into the reference arm (II) and the sample arm (III) using a beam splitter. The beam in the sample arm is focused onto a sample and scanned to acquire images. Light backscattered from the sample and the reference end mirror is recombined at the beam splitter and sent to the detector arm (I). The detector arm is a spectrometer that measures the spectral interference pattern. Scanning of the beam and acquisition from the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is synchronized using a personal computer.

therefore no longer remain coherent with the light reﬂected back in the reference arm (17). A variation of OCT, called optical coherence microscopy (OCM), utilizes a high NA objective to achieve similar transverse spatial resolution as reﬂectance CM, at the expense of a short depth-of-focus (18). In this case, the axial resolution may then be determined by the focusing optics instead of the source bandwidth. Optical sectioning is achieved with both spatial and coherence gating, instead of spatial ﬁltering alone. The advantage of OCM is that it has a greater penetration depth than CM. Because of the high NA and the narrow beam waist, the short focal region is effectively limited to a single en face plane in the sample. As a result, the beam in OCM is typically scanned in two lateral dimensions to acquire an en face image, as opposed to a cross-sectional (depth-resolved) image as in OCT. Because OCM uses a high NA objective and can use the same laser source (titanium:sapphire) as in MPM, it is possible to perform OCM at the same time as MPM to collect image data based on multiple contrast mechanisms (19–22). This enables simultaneous acquisition of high resolution scattering and ﬂuorescence information from thick, highly scattering samples. OCT has also been used simultaneously with ﬂuorescence CM to provide structural and functional information in engineered tissues (23). Additional variations of OCT and OCM exist that enable imaging based of different contrast mechanisms. Spectroscopic OCT (24) and OCM (25) measure the depth-resolved spectrum of backscattered light, which allows wavelength-dependent properties of the sample to be assessed. Biomechanical properties can

be spatially resolved using optical coherence elastography (26, 27). Doppler OCT is a technique which measures frequency shifts of backscattered light to measure dynamic events such as blood ﬂow in vivo (28).

3.4. OCT and CM Imaging of Cell Dynamics in Chitosin Scaffold Culture

OCT and CM images of the chitosin scaffold cell culture were taken at several time points after seeding to observe dynamic changes to the distribution of the cell population (29, 30). OCT is used to visualize changes to the cell population that occur throughout the entire volume of the 3D chitosin scaffold culture. CM, in comparison, provides cellular-level resolution and functional information near the surface of the cell culture. 1. The micro-incubator is placed in the sample arm of the OCT system allowing the chitosin scaffold to be imaged while maintaining the sterile environment. Three-dimensional OCT images of the same chitosin scaffold are taken at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after seeding (see Note 5). 2. To verify the dynamic changes observed in the OCT images taken on different days, different identical samples are histologically prepared after being incubated for the same durations (see Note 6). The histological samples are viewed with a standard light microscope and compared to cross-sectional OCT images (see Fig. 13.2). 3. To more effectively visualize the whole cell population, 3D OCT data images are reconstructed and viewed from different angles (see Fig. 13.3).

Cells are relatively evenly distributed throughout the scaffold after seeding. After several days, it is evident that the cells have migrated to the surface of the culture and have formed a dense, highly scattering layer. This demonstrates the ability of OCT to observe morphological features in a 3D cell culture at different times during the development of the 3D culture.

4. To visualize the culture at cellular resolution and to observe functional characteristics (see Note 7), CM images of the superﬁcial layers of the chitosin scaffold are taken in ﬂuorescence mode using a commercial system, DM-IRE (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). CM images are taken at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days to observe dynamic changes to the culture (see Fig. 13.4).

Fig. 13.4. Fluorescence CM images of GFP-transfected ﬁbroblasts in a 3D chitosin scaffold culture taken at day 1, 3, 5, and 7 (a–d, respectively). The red channel is the autoﬂuorescence signal from the scaffold, the green channel is the GFP ﬂuorescence from the cells, and the blue channel is the backscattering signal predominantly from the deposited extracellular matrix and over time, the higher scattering cell density near the surface of the scaffold. One day after seeding, the ﬁbroblasts are spherical in shape and have a low GFP signal. As the cells grow and attach to the substrate, there is an increase in expression of the GFP-vinculin gene. The increase in the backscattering signal by day 7 veriﬁes that the cells have formed a dense, highly scattering layer near the surface over a period of several days.

3.5. Imaging Effects of Mechanical Stimuli on 3D Cultures with OCM and MPM

Mechanical forces are known to affect morphology and genetic expression in cells. To observe the effects of mechanical forces on cells in 3D cultures both micro-topographic substrates and Matrigel cultures (see Note 8) were imaged before and after being subjected to uniaxial stretching (31). Integrated OCM and MPM allows simultaneous acquisition of ﬂuorescence and scatteringbased images. For these samples, this enables visualization of individual cells (via MPM) and the local structural microenvironment of the substrates (via OCM).

1. En face OCM and MPM images of the 3D microtopographic substrate are taken 3 days after seeding (see Fig. 13.5a). Two MPM channels are obtained by acquiring the same image twice using different emission ﬁlters for ﬂuorescence detection (see Note 9). 2. The culture is mechanically stimulated with the FlexCell apparatus with 5% cyclic, 1 Hz equibiaxial sinusoidal stretching for a period of 18 h. 3. En face OCM and MPM images are again taken to observe the changes to cell morphology caused by the mechanical stimulation (see Fig. 13.5b). 4. 3D OCM and MPM images of the Matrigel culture are taken prior to mechanical stimulation. Three-dimensional data sets are obtained by acquiring a series of en face planes at different depths in the sample. Using the Analyze software, en face planes are computationally extracted from the 3D data to observe the structure (see Fig. 13.6a) and functional (see Fig. 13.6b) properties of cells in the culture. 5. The Matrigel culture is subjected to the same mechanical strain as in step 2.

Fig. 13.5. OCM/MPM images of GFP-vinculin ﬁbroblast cells on a micro-topographic substrate (linear arrays of micropegs) before (a) and after (b) mechanical stimulation. OCM shows the features of the substrate (grey) while MPM images show the GFP ﬂuorescence (green channel) and the nuclear stain (blue channel). Visualizing the nucleus enables individual cells to be clearly identiﬁed while the GFP signal shows the extent of the cell body, the level of adhesion of the cell to the substrate, and interactions with adjacent cells. The ﬂexible polymer (PDMS) substrate was repeatedly stretched in the direction of the white arrow in (b). Mechanical stimulation results in an elongation of the ﬁbroblast cells, roughly along the direction of stretch. The stretching causes an elongation of the cells and an increase in the distribution of the GFP signal indicating that there is an increase in expression of vinculin.

The green signal in the MPM image is from GFP and indicates the relative degree of cell adhesion. The blue signal is the nuclear stain which identiﬁes individual cells. Scattering in this culture, as seen in the OCM image, is caused by both the cells and the extra-cellular environment (collagen secreted by the cells). It is observed that the cells have organized into an interconnected architecture along the ﬁbrous collagen structure of the Matrigel. Modiﬁed ﬁgure used with permission (31).

6. 3D OCM and MPM images are taken after stimulation for comparison. Different projections of the overlaid 3D data set are viewed using the Analyze software (see Fig. 13.7). 7. Analysis of the before and after OCM and MPM images allowed the effects of mechanical stimulation on the function and morphology of cells in these two types of cultures to be observed (see Note 10).

4. Notes
1. Traditional microscopy requires that a specimen be ﬁxed and cut into thin slices and placed on a glass slide for imaging. Optical sectioning refers to imaging thin sections of the intact specimen. In addition to enabling visualization of samples in 3D, optical sectioning has the advantage of eliminating the need for the harsh processing steps that physically destroy the specimen and may alter some of its structural properties. The ability to obtain optical sections in live specimens allows one to observe dynamic events in biology. Instead of viewing different specimens at ﬁxed points in time, single specimens can be observed longitudinally over time with minimal disturbance. The optical sectioning techniques discussed in this chapter are particularly

The 3D reconstruction is shown (top left) as well as projections along different axes giving a comprehensive view of this cluster of cells. The red channel corresponds to the scattering from the sample (OCM) while the green and blue channels are ﬂuorescence images (MPM). Three-dimensional reconstruction, rotation, and computational sectioning at arbitrary plane angles allow for a more comprehensive view of a 3D cell culture. Mechanical stimulation in the direction of the arrows in the x-y plane has induced the cells to become more spherical and form clusters, potentially indicating that adhesion sites with the scaffold were broken during mechanical stimulation.

well-suited for imaging thick, highly scattering samples that do not allow light to be transmitted. 2. MPM is typically less harmful to biological specimen than ﬂuorescence mode CM because it minimizes photobleaching and photodamage (32). However, MPM requires focusing ultrashort laser pulses into a sub-femtoliter volume of a sample. Although power levels needed for MPM are moderate (2–20 mW), the high instantaneous intensity of light could possibly damage a specimen through different mechanisms. Exposure to ultrashort pulses of light has been shown to cause cell death through oxidative photodamage (33, 34). In practice, damage can be minimized by limiting the power levels and reducing the exposure time of the sample to the laser beam. The later can be achieved by rapidly scanning the beam or blocking the beam path to the sample when the beam is not scanning. 3. A key advantage of swept-source OCT over spectraldomain OCT is the imaging speed. Imaging speed for spectral-domain OCT is limited by the read-out speed

of the line camera in the spectrometer. Currently, maximum readout rates are ∼100 kHz, or ∼100,000 columns in OCT or points in OCM, per second). Swept-source OCT using Fourier-domain mode-locked lasers can achieve speeds of several hundred kHz (16). However, these lasers currently operate in the 1.3 m wavelength range. Spectral-domain OCT can be performed with a broad bandwidth laser source centered at any wavelength; however, line cameras sensitive to wavelengths greater than 1000 nm use indium-gallium-arsenide detection elements and can be expensive. Very high imaging speeds are needed when imaging in vivo or when observing fast dynamic events. 4. Resulting porous scaffold should have an interconnected porosity of >80% with an average pore size of 100 m. 5. With this OCT system, the resolution is sufﬁcient so that the location and structure of the cell population can be visualized, even though individual cellular features cannot be identiﬁed. The chitosin scaffold itself is not visible due to the low scattering properties of the material. OCT was capable of imaging throughout the depth of the sample (∼1 mm). 6. Histological preparation included ﬁxing samples with 3.7% formaldehyde, embedding in parafﬁn, cutting into 5 m slices with a microtome, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin. 7. These ﬁbroblast cells are transfected to co-express GFP with vinculin. Vinculin is a surface adhesion protein and thus the presence of a GFP signal correlates to cell–cell and cell–substrate adhesion. 8. Although cells in 3D micro-topographic cultures are located on a surface of the polymer substrate, these substrates have deﬁned 3D features and characteristics, compared to ﬂat planar cultures, and have been shown to affect cellular organization (35). Cells in the Matrigel culture are in a true 3D microenvironment. 9. All ﬂuorescent dyes used with single photon excitation can be used for MPM. The emission spectrum of a dye excited with either one photon or with two simultaneous photons is similar and the same ﬁlters can often be used. However, the two-photon excitation spectrum of a ﬂuorescent molecule is not easily predicted from its one-photon spectrum and must therefore be determined experimentally in many cases. The two-photon emission spectra for many commonly used dyes and biomolecules have been characterized (36, 37).

10. The response of the cells in the Marigel culture to stretching is opposite to what was observed with the cells on the micro-topographic substrates, where the ﬁbroblasts were initially more spherical, and became elongated following mechanical stimulation. The different responses could potentially be explained by differences in adhesion strength to the PDMS and to the Matrigel, or to the differences in strain experienced at the cellular level in each type of 3D culture. These images demonstrate that OCM and MPM can enable the observation of the complex cell-scaffold interactions in 3D cultures. With this integrated imaging technique, 3D multi-modality information from cultures can be acquired, providing a comprehensive view of the structural and functional characteristics of the sample.
