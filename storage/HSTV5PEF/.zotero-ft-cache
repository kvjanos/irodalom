Expression and Preparation of Fusion Proteins from Recombinant A,gt11 Pliages
Sheng-He Huang and Ambrose Jong 1. Introduction The phage A.gtl 1 system has become increasingly popular for expression of cDNAs or genomic DNAs either in phage plaques or in bacteria lysogenized with recombinant phages (1,2). It offers the advantages of high cloning efficiency, high-level expression, the relative stability of P-galactosidase fusion proteins, and simple approaches to purify the fusion proteins. After the desired clone is detected and purified, it is often necessary to obtain preparative amounts of recombinant protein specified by the fusion of the foreign sequence to the carboxyl-terminus of P-galactosidase in Xgtl 1 expression system. The conventional method for preparing fusion proteins from the recombinant A,gtl 1 clones involves production of phage lysogens m Escherichia coli strain Y1089 followed by inducing /acZ-directed fusion protein expression with isopropyl-pD-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1). This method has two limitations: it is time-consuming, and phage lysogeny occurs at a low frequency. We have previously described a method for making fusion proteinsfromLB agar plates containing E. coli Y1090 infected with a high concentration of recombinant A,gtl 1 phages (up to 5 x 10* PFU/150 x 15-mm plate) (3). A liquid culture method for preparing fusion proteins from E. coli Y1090 infected with the A,gtl 1 clones has previously been described (4). More recently, some improvements have been made on the plate method by repeating induction and elution (5). Although the liquid culture method allows the recovery of only 0.2-1% of total proteins (6,7), this method generally yields 5—10% of expressed protein in solution, that is, most lysed cells are trapped in the agar and the expressed proteins are recovered in a small volume of inducing solution, resulting in a higher final concentration of protein. More than 200 (jg of fiision protein can be obtained from one plate.

45Fig. 1. Induction of the 190-kDaERP72 fusion protein with various concentrations of IPTG (lane t, no IPTG; lane 2, 2.5 mM, lane 3, 5 mM; lane 4, 10 mM). Fusion protein was detected by Western blot analysis with anti-ERP72 antibody (8). Currently, the plate method appears to be a simple and efficient way to express and prepare fusion proteins from recombinant Xgtl 1 phages (Figs. 1 and 2). This chapter describes how the p-galactosidase fusion proteins can be made and isolated from the recombinant Xgtl 1 phages with the plate method.

2. Materials 2.1. Plating Bacteria

LB/ampicillin medium: 10 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/L. After auloclaving and cooling, add lOOmg/Lampicillinfroma 100 mg/mL stock solution prior to use. 4. LB plates: 1.5% agar in LB containing 10mA/MgCl2and lOOf^/mLampicillin. 5. LB top agar: 0.7% agar in LB containing 10 mA/MgCl; and 100 jig/mL ampicillin, 6. lA/MgS04 (autoclave). 7.

45Fig. 2. Repeated induction and elulion of the 190-kDa ERP72 ftision protein from agar plates. E. coU Y1090 cells were infected and plated by the procedure described in Section 3. Plates were incubated for 3 h at 42°C, and 5 mL of 5 niA/IPTG in 0.5X LB containing 10mA/MgSO4 added to each plate. Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 3 h {lane 1), and the supernatant saved. Induction and elution were repeated five times with 1-h intervals between inductions (lanes 2-6). Fusion proteins recovered after each induction was analyzed by Western blotting.

1. Grow host cells: Streak the Y1090 on LB agar plates containing 100 pg/mL ampicillin. After growing this plate overnight at 37°C, store it at 4°C. Inoculate the plating cells from a single colony in LB containing 100 |ag/mL ampicillm for 8-18hat37°C. 2. Infect the cells with phages: Up to 5 x 10* recombinant phages/plate (150 x 15 mm) can be used. Mix 700 |jL of the Y1090 culture with up to 200 |uL of the phage in SM. Allow the phage to adsorb the cells for 15-30 min at room temperature. 3. Plate cells and phages: Add 7.5 mL of LB top agar (at 45-50°C) to the infected cells, pour onto an LB agar + ampicillin plate (at room temperature), and plate evenly over the surface of the plate. Use slightly dry plates (2 d old) so that better adhesion of the top agar to the bottom agar will be obtained 4. Grow plaques: Allow the top agar of the plates to solidify for 30 min at room temperature. Incubate the plates at 42°C for 3-3.5 h. 3.2. Fusion Protein Induction 1. Add 5-10 mL of 5 mMIPTG in 0.5X LB containing 10 mMMgS04 to each plate 2. Incubate at 37°C for 3 h. Recover the supernatant. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, except that the incubation time is reduced to 1-2 h Pool the eluate from each induction. 3.3. Detection of Fusion Proteins 1. Transfer 24 |jL of the eluate to a microcentrifuge tube. Spin at 12,000g for 5 min to remove the cellular debris and agar, and then transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. 2. Add 6 |JL of 5X PAGE sample buffer to the tube, and boil for 5 min. Analyze samples on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualize proteins with Coomassie blue, or detect theftjsionprotein on Western blot with specific antibodies. 3.4. Preparing Crude Fusion Proteins 1. Centrifuge the pooled eluates at 15,000g for 10 mm to get rid of the debris and save the supernatant. 2. To the supernatant, add either solid ammonium sulfate or 3 vol of saturated ammonium sulfate to 75% saturation, and stir at 4°C for 20 min. 3. Centrifiige at 15,000g for 20 min, discard the supernatant, and redissolve the pellet in cold TEP buffer at approx 20 mg/mL 3.5. Immunoafflnity Purification of Fusion Proteins (6) After diluting the crude fusion proteins with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, to about 4 mg/mL total protein, it is convenient to purify the fusion protein by the prepared immunoaffmity column (ProtoSorb lacZ Immmunoaffmity Adsorbent) available from Promega.

1. In some cases, allowing expression at 30°C rather than at 37°C could help stabilize expressed fusion proteins. 2. Low amount of IPTG and phages may be used if expression is too high. The expression level of fusion proteins can be estimated by immunoblotting analysis on a plaque lift along with dot blotting a series of known amounts of the antigen on a membrane disk, which is also used to make a plaque lift The lower detection limits of alkaline phosphatase- and peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies are 20-50 and 200-500 pg of antigens, respectively (1). 3. In certain cases where the fusion protein recovery is extremely low (i.e., <5 jjg fusion protein/plate), the yield may be improved by a couple of ways. Some fusion proteins trapped in the top agar can be extracted with TEP buffer and precipitated with ammonium sulfate as above. The recovery may be increased by including a fractionation step (such as gel filtration) prior to immunoaffinity purification. 4 Fusion proteins may be purified by alternative ways. If the immunoaffinity column IS not available, the large size of the fusion protein is suitable for preoperative SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration chromatography
