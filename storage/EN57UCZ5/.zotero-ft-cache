Small molecule screening by imaging
Ulrike S Eggert* and Timothy J Mitchison
Useful small molecule tools can be discovered in imaging screens that measure phenotype in single cells or small organisms. Recent examples include identiÔ¨Åcation of small molecule inhibitors of processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, mitotic spindle length determination, melanogenesis, aggresome formation, membrane transport and nuclear export. Imaging screens are currently limited by challenges in the areas of image analysis and target identiÔ¨Åcation. We discuss the use of model organisms such as zebraÔ¨Åsh in screens and review different methods of target identiÔ¨Åcation. The emerging Ô¨Åeld of automated image analysis is also introduced.

academia and industry for the discovery and characterization of useful compounds is high, but many challenges remain, particularly at the level of target identiÔ¨Åcation and data analysis. In this review, we discuss recent progress, considering both small molecule screens and RNAi screens, which use similar methods and face related challenges. Small molecule imaging screens typically involve the following steps [4,5]. First, cells are plated into opticalbottom multiwell plates, treated with small molecules and incubated for an appropriate time. Proteins of interest are then rendered Ô¨Çuorescent by some combination of small molecule Ô¨Çuorescent probes, immunoÔ¨Çuorescence with antibodies, and expression of green Ô¨Çuorescence protein (GFP)-tagged proteins in cells. The last method can be applied to both live and Ô¨Åxed cells. Next, Ô¨Çuorescent images are captured by automated microscopy. The images are then analyzed to provide measures of phenotypic change, identifying wells that contain desired, undesired or unexpected phenotypes. Examples of phenotypic images are shown in Figures 1a and 2. In small molecule screening, it is eventually necessary to identify the biochemical target causing the phenotypic change. This can be challenging, especially if phenotypic change results from perturbation of more than one macromolecule. Recent screens have provided the community with useful small molecule tools to study cellular processes of varied complexity, such as cell migration [6], cytokinesis [7], mitotic spindle length determination [8], melanogenesis [9], aggresome formation [10], membrane transport [11] and nuclear export [12]. Many of these screens result in a variety of small molecules that target different facets of the process. This is well illustrated by the discovery of small molecules that affect different steps of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling cascade that controls nuclear export of the Forkhead family of transcription factors [12], a process mutated in many cancers. When discussing small molecule phenotypic screens, it is important to acknowledge the synergy from the parallel development of genome-wide RNAi screening. Although small molecules and RNAi function through different mechanisms [13], they can have similar effects on cells and can employ the same screening methods. Because genome-wide RNAi screens are now possible in mammalian and Drosophila cells, and in Caenorhabditis elegans animals, there has been a surge of interest in the technologies required for successful screening [14]. For example, the CellProÔ¨Åler image analysis software was recently

Introduction
Small molecules are valuable tools to study dynamic biological processes with high temporal resolution and can catalyze therapeutic drug discovery [1]. Active small molecules can be discovered by screening chemical libraries for alteration of a speciÔ¨Åc protein activity in pure protein in vitro assays or for a desired phenotype in cellbased assays [2]. In the past, cell-based assays have usually been established to report on effects on the activity of a single pathway or process, typically using as the readout a luminescence or Ô¨Çuorescence signal measured in a plate reader. In cell imaging assays, Ô¨Åelds of cells are visualized using Ô¨Çuorescent tags attached to different macromolecules, and automated microscopy. Such data potentially contain a large amount of information relevant to desired as well as unexpected phenotypic changes, and the approach is sometimes called ‚Äòhigh content screening‚Äô [3]. The potential of this method in

released to analyze RNAi data in single cells (http:// www.cellproÔ¨Åler.org), but it should be equally applicable to small molecule data. The community studying C. elegans, where RNAi screens Ô¨Årst became available, has systematically deÔ¨Åned and characterized phenotypes allowing standardized phenotypic proÔ¨Åling [15,16]. As more screens are carried out and phenotypic proÔ¨Åling becomes routine in all organisms, comparisons of small molecule and RNAi phenotypes will be an important tool in small molecule target identiÔ¨Åcation. We have made a Ô¨Årst attempt at this strategy, which is discussed below. In addition to technology sharing, small molecules and RNAi can also be combined in modiÔ¨Åer screens to explore mechanistic connectivity. To cause a speciÔ¨Åc phenotypic change in an imaging screen, a small molecule must be active on living cells (either by targeting cell surface molecules or by permeating into the cytoplasm), and it must also display some speciÔ¨Åcity in its activity. These are major advantages over pure protein screens. However, phenotypic screens are not as commonly used because they still face some experimental limitations, especially in the areas of image analysis and target identiÔ¨Åcation, which are discussed below in more detail.

amounts of data can be challenging [24]. Increasingly, relational databases are used to facilitate image analysis, although it may be most efÔ¨Åcient to store only metainformation about images (information on what the image is, and the results of image analysis) in the database, and store the actual images as ordinary Ô¨Åles. One approach to databases for image handling is provided by the Open Microscopy Initiative (OME), and open-source academic consortium [25]. Once the images are collected and stored, the next problem is to turn them into quantitative phenotypic information. Although we know that images are rich in biological information, there is currently no single best method to quantitate and extract this information. This problem must be solved on a screen-to-screen basis, and optimal solutions typically require interaction of screeners with image analysis experts. Image analysis typically starts by identiÔ¨Åcation of individual cells and also of regions of interest within each cell (nuclei, organelles, etc.). Next, measurements of intensity, size, shape and texture are made in the identiÔ¨Åed regions. The more probes that are multiplexed in a given experiment, the more measurements can be made. Ten or more measurements for a single problem are possible [26,27,28]. In some cases, the measurement is obviously biologically relevant, for example the fraction of a signaling protein in the cytoplasm vs. nucleus. In other cases, the interpretation is non-obvious, such as a measure of the texture and size of a nucleus. Biologists naturally focus on interpretable measurements, and many screens have been based on these. However, several studies have demonstrated that measurements on cells that are not obviously interpretable nevertheless contain useful phenotypic information (Figure 1) [26,27,28]. As a practical issue, images can be analyzed with homegrown software, or commercial packages. Commercial software tends to be more reliable and ‚Äòuser friendly‚Äò, but it can be expensive and may not provide the Ô¨Çexibility needed to ask speciÔ¨Åc questions. An interesting development is the release of open-source image analysis packages, for example, CellProÔ¨Åler and ImageJ (http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). As these attract interactive user communities, they may ultimately offer the best of both worlds. Most scientists approaching a screen tend to view phenotype in a relatively one-dimensional way, asking questions about speciÔ¨Åc pathways or processes. However, cells contain many different features, and cell images can almost always provide information on more than one of them. For example, DNA morphology reports on cell cycle state, but also on protein synthesis, apoptosis and other pathways [29]. Thus, phenotype is inevitably multidimensional, and is best described not by a single number, but by a vector in some multi-dimensional

Screening in model organisms
A signiÔ¨Åcant limitation of cell-based assays is the challenge of Ô¨Ånding single cell systems that recapitulate the complex biology of tissues and diseases. This can be addressed to some extent by using primary cells, but a more general approach is phenotypic screening in whole organisms [17,18]. Small model organisms, including embryos of zebraÔ¨Åsh and C. elegans nematodes, and perhaps also Ô¨Çies, can be cultured in multiwell plates and treated with large numbers of diverse compounds [19‚Äì21]. Imaging is the logical readout for such screens, using either classic morphology, or GFP expressed in speciÔ¨Åc cells or organs. In two recent zebraÔ¨Åsh examples, small molecules were identiÔ¨Åed that suppress the effect of a mutation causing a cardiovascular defect [22], and that suppress a mutation causing mitotic arrest by an Sphase delay [23]. In both cases, the screens were performed on mutant organisms, looking for compounds that rescued a molecularly deÔ¨Åned defect. This approach has the advantage of targeting the screen to a speciÔ¨Åc area of biology, and also of requiring an absence of toxic side effects in the hits. C. elegans embryos also appear ideal for screening in that they are small, robust, well characterized genetically, and much used for RNAi screening.

Image analysis
Perhaps the single largest challenge in image-based screening is data analysis. This problem starts with the sheer quantity of data; several terabytes is not untypical for a single screen. Storing and retrieving such large

‚Äòphenotype space‚Äò. A familiar example of multidimensional analysis is transcript proÔ¨Åling, where the levels of many thousands of RNAs are used as a measure of phenotype [30]. Powerful methods have been developed for comparing and quantifying phenotypes from RNA proÔ¨Åling. Progress has been made on the problem of turning images of Ô¨Åxed cells in into quantitative biological information [26,27,28], but this Ô¨Åeld is still in its infancy. Time lapse movies of cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins contain large amounts of information that are potentially complementary to data from Ô¨Åxed cells. Currently, the challenge of storing and analyzing movies is sufÔ¨Åciently daunting that there have been few examples of live imaging screens. The large information content inherent in movies was illustrated in a genome-wide RNAi screen in C. elegans, where human interpretations of phenotypes from movies were integrated into a multidimensional phenotypic proÔ¨Åle capable of distinguishing many different cellular defects in early embryos [15]. Using advanced computational methods, it may be possible to fully automate aspects of phenotype scoring in C. elegans [31]. Important information can also be extracted from movies using fairly simple analysis methods. In one recent example, automated analysis of periodic motion was used to score compounds from a small library for effects on heartbeat in zebraÔ¨Åsh [32]. This high-throughput method was as effective as, and much cheaper than, testing on dogs for detecting adverse effects, and may allow such testing much earlier in the drug development process. As the informatics challenges are progressively solved, we expect to see more use of live cell imaging in small molecule screening.

of the Rho pathway and inhibited Rho kinase in vitro. In a similar strategy, the small molecule secramine, which inhibits membrane export from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, was shown to inhibit the small GTPase Cdc42 in a RhoGDI-dependent manner [11]. In some assays, the readout can be designed with speciÔ¨Åc candidate targets in mind. For example, Vogt and colleagues screened for small molecules that caused accumulation of phosphorylated Erk, a member of the MAPK cascade [33]. Some of the compounds inhibited MKP-3, a phosphatase targeting Erk, in vitro and overcame the effects of overexpressed MKP-3, suggesting that they target this enzyme. To facilitate target ID by candidate testing, it is useful to include in any screen a collection of compounds with known mechanisms of action, including toxins and medicines. The valuable information that can result from screening such collections has been discussed [34]. Collections of several hundred biologically active molecules are commercially available (e.g. ICCB Known Bioactives from Biomol; http://www.biomol.com). In afÔ¨Ånity methods, a small molecule is tethered to a solid support and cell extract is passed over this support to see which proteins will bind. For this approach to be successful, the small molecule has to be attached to a linker without changing its activity. This will be easier if a chemical library is designed to include a linkage site. A tagged triazine library has been used in several screens [35], most recently to identify small molecules that increased pigmentation [9]. One of these small molecules, melanogenin, inhibited prohibitin, a mitochondrial protein not previously known to be involved in melanin generation. AfÔ¨Ånity chromatography may also be easier if the library is screened for activity in cell-free systems, so the same system can be used directly as the input for biochemical puriÔ¨Åcation. In one example, a screen for alterations in mitotic spindle morphology in Xenopus extract identiÔ¨Åed a compound, diminutol, that targets NAPD-dependent oxidoreductase [8]. In an interesting combination of afÔ¨Ånity chromatography and automated image analysis, Tanaka et al. compared the morphological proÔ¨Åles of kinase inhibitors with various structural scaffolds and showed that a compound with an unusual proÔ¨Åle unexpectedly targeted carbonyl reductase 1 [27]. We developed a target identiÔ¨Åcation strategy complementary to afÔ¨Ånity and candidate-based approaches, which involves comparisons between small molecule and RNAi phenotypes. If the phenotype is the same, the protein targeted by RNAi and the small molecule is likely to be the same. In our proof-of-principle study, we expanded this simple concept to a genome-wide level. We carried out parallel genome-wide RNAi and small molecule screens to identify proteins involved in cytokinesis, the Ô¨Ånal step of cell division, and small molecules that target these proteins [7]. We grouped the RNAi phenotypes into different categories and compared these

Target identiÔ¨Åcation
Target identiÔ¨Åcation has always been a rate-limiting step in cell-based small molecule screens. Advances in image analysis and RNAi screening have added to the toolkit for solving this problem. Traditionally, small molecule targets have been identiÔ¨Åed by afÔ¨Ånity methods or candidate-based approaches. Both of these approaches can work well in some circumstances and can be more challenging in others. For example, a candidate-based approach will not work if the target protein was previously unknown. Sometimes the protein target is already known and the small molecule can be used to uncover a new role of the protein (e.g. a screen for inhibitors of aggresome formation discovered an unexpected role for histone deacetylase in this process [10]). Usually, a candidatebased approach works best if the target is determined through a series of secondary assays. In a screen for small molecules that inhibited cell migration, a very broad problem that involves many cellular machines, Yarrow et al. used secondary assays to narrow down potential targets [6]. They discovered that the small molecule Rockout showed a phenotype consistent with inhibition

to small molecule phenotypes. Using this strategy, we were able to identify a small molecule inhibitor of the Aurora B kinase pathway (Figure 2). Phenotypic comparisons also have limits because the phenotype of small molecule inhibition might be different from an RNAi phenotype, where the protein has been depleted from the cell [13]. A small molecule could activate a protein or inhibit one domain of a multi-domain complex, which might result in a different cellular effect. The identiÔ¨Åcation of small molecule targets remains a challenge, but some encouraging progress has been made and a combination of all existing strategies should make it less of an obstacle to phenotypic screening by imaging in the future.

Conclusions
Image-based screening has huge potential in small molecule discovery, but until recently has been limited by technical challenges. Phenotypic screens are now possible in model organisms such as zebraÔ¨Åsh, making it an ideal platform to discover non-toxic small molecules that affect multicellular processes such as heart function. Parallel developments in small molecule and genome-wide RNAi screening have given a boost to screening by imaging especially in the area of automated image analysis and phenotypic proÔ¨Åling. A combination of these new methods and traditional approaches has been useful in identifying small molecule targets. Challenges still exist, but recent developments have been very positive and should allow screening by imaging to become more widely used in the future.
