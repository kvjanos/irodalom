The increasing interest in autophagy in a wide range of organisms, accompanied by an ever‑growing influx of researchers into this field, necessitates a good understanding of the methodologies available to monitor this process. In this review we discuss current approaches that can be used to follow the overall process of autophagy, as well as individual steps, from yeast to human. The majority of the review considers methods that apply to macroautophagy; however, we also consider alternative types of degradation including chaperone‑mediated autophagy and microautophagy. This information is meant to provide a resource for newcomers as well as a stimulus for experienced researchers who may be prompted to develop additional assays to examine autophagy‑related pathways.

intrODuCtiOn
Macroautophagy is one of the major degradative pathways in eukaryotic cells, and it is the only one with the capacity to degrade entire organelles.1-3 This process is ubiquitous among eukaryotes and has been characterized from yeast to man.4 Various developmental pathways utilize macroautophagy,5 and it is also associated with certain pathophysiological conditions.6,7 These roles for macroautophagy have been the focus of recent reviews and will not be discussed in this article. A number of protein components required for macroautophagy have been identified within the past decade.8,9 The functions of these proteins are still being determined and have also been the subject of several reviews.10-13 This information, combined with our morphological understanding of macroautophagy, allows the process to be divided into eight steps (Fig. 1). These steps begin with induction,14,15 a signal transduction event that triggers the nucleation of a sequestering membrane or phagophore (Fig. 2), which leads to the formation of a cytosolic double-membrane vesicle that sequesters cytoplasm, the hallmark of macroautophagy.16 Microautophagic processes also involve sequestration of a portion of cytoplasm; however, this occurs at the surface of the lysosome/vacuole.17 The expansion of the phagophore and completion (Fig. 3) of the sequestering vesicle, the autophagosome, probably involve some type of membrane delivery event.18 During this time, most of the protein components may cycle on and off the forming autophagosome because only two of the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins, Atg8 and Atg19, appear to remain associated with the completed vesicle. The role of Atg8 is not known, but it is considered to be a structural protein that is critical in autophagosome formation, whereas Atg19 is a receptor that functions in cargo recognition and packaging (Fig. 4).19,20 The recycling of Atg9 may be highly regulated and is certainly complex because it is a transmembrane protein (Fig. 5; Legakis JE, Yen W-L, He C, Yorimitsu T, Monastyrska I, Klionsky DJ, unpublished results).21 Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome/vacuole utilizes components that are common with all other fusion events that involve these organelles including SNARE and Rab proteins as well as components of the class C Vps/HOPS machinery (step 6, Fig. 1).9,22 The breakdown of the autophagic cargo within the lysosome/vacuole lumen and the subsequent efflux through permeases allows the resultant macromolecules to be reused in the cytosol for metabolic reactions (steps 7 and 8, Fig. 1). Because of the increasing connections made between autophagy and human physiology, this field has garnered increased attention, which in turn has led to renewed interest in methods for monitoring this process. Three general types of methods have been predominant: (1) microscopy, (2) biochemical methods, and (3) detection of protein modifications through SDS-PAGE and western blotting (Table 1).

Non‑specific autophagy can be separated into seven steps: (1) Induction; (3) Vesicle nucle‑ ation; (4) Vesicle expansion and completion; (5) Retrieval; (6) Fusion; (7) Breakdown; (8) Efflux. Specific types of autophagy include an additional step (2) of cargo recognition and packaging. The cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway and pexophagy are two examples of specific autophagy.

in particular electron microscopy, has been utilized for the longest period of time, reflecting the fact that biochemical and molecular methods are more recent developments; however, microscopy is still indispensable for the characterization of autophagic organelles. Quantitative studies of autophagy were greatly facilitated by the realization that a major fraction of the degradation of long-lived endogenous protein, easily followed by a pulse-chase radiolabeling approach,23 was due to macroautophagy, which could be specifically suppressed by amino acids or 3-methyladenine.24,25 Even more specific quantitative measurements of autophagy, and of individual steps in the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, became possible with the introduction of biochemical assays that measured the transfer of

electroinjected or endogenous (enzymatic) probes from the cytosol to sedimentable autophagic organelles such as autophagosomes and lysosomes.26-32 With the identification of the molecular components of the macroautophagic machinery, a range of new assays became available that relied on specific properties of the Atg proteins. In addition, some assays were developed or adapted specifically to monitor autophagy based on the particular process being investigated. For example, the filter trap assay is utilized to detect defects in autophagic clearance of protein aggregates;33 this use stems from the relatively recent studies that implicate autophagy in neurodegeneration and the removal of inclusion bodies.34,35

Figure 2. Machinery involved in signal transduction events that induce autophagy (step 1 of Fig. 1) and nucleate formation of the sequestering vesicle (step 3). In yeast (top), the Atg1 kinase is part of a complex that is composed of proteins that are relatively specific for autophagy (Atg17, Atg29 and possibly Atg13) or the Cvt pathway (Atg11, Atg20, Atg24 and Vac8). The phosphorylation of at least Atg13 is nutrient‑dependent and the highly phosphorylated form appears to have a lower affinity for Atg1. The Atg1 and Atg13 proteins appear to be phosphorylated in a Tor‑ and protein kinase A‑dependent manner. In eukaryotes (bottom), Tor is regu‑ lated by a class I PtdIns 3‑kinase that acts through a regu‑ latory cascade of kinases and phosphatases to inhibit autophagy. In this case, in addition to Atg proteins, other targets of Tor such as p70S6 kinase also contribute to the modulation of autophagy.

array of assays available in yeast, or assays that are specific to plants. In addition, because many of these techniques are currently restricted to yeasts, previous reviews have generally excluded most of the assays that measure specific functions of individual Atg proteins. In contrast, the present review is fairly inclusive, dealing with the yeast assays as well as assays used in higher eukaryotes. Specific protocols are not provided and the descriptions and discussions are only meant to give a brief indication of the relative complexity of the procedure. The primary literature should be consulted for complete details. The methods are presented below according to the autophagic pathways, steps and organelles to which they apply.

Autophagic‑lysosomal protein processing/ degradation. The original definition of autophagy38 corresponds to the process now often referred to as macroautophagy, a term that is becoming increasingly useful to distinguish the bulk sequestration of normal cytoplasm39,40 from the many specialized autophagic functions that have been characterized in recent years, such as chaperonemediated autophagy,41 pexophagy,3 xenophagy,42 mitophagy,43 etc. In the present article, the term autophagy will be used synonymously with macroautophagy unless otherwise specified. (Macro)autophagy is a largely nonselective process; any endogenous or introduced cytoplasmic marker can, therefore, in principle be used to monitor the overall activity of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, where autophagic sequestration is usually the rate-limiting step. Because protein is the major biochemical constituent of cytoplasm, protein degradation is both a logical and convenient way of measuring autophagy, although it should be noted that RNA degradation can be used for this purpose as well.44 The obvious drawback of protein degradation measurements is that they do not just reflect autophagic activity, but a number of other proteolytic processes as well, such as proteasomal degradation (the major alternative pathway), other forms of autophagy (chaper183

With the increase in assays it is now possible to monitor many of the individual steps of macroautophagy (Table 2). Clearly the assignment of some assays to one particular category is arbitrary. For example, assays such as those measuring degradation monitor not just breakdown but also reflect the functionality of previous steps. Furthermore, most of the Atg molecular marker assays can only be utilized in fungal systems, particularly yeasts, although Atg8/LC3 has become an important tool in the study of mammalian macroautophagy as well (Table 3). Previous reviews have covered some of the assays mentioned in this article;36,37 however, those reviews have focused on higher eukaryotes. As a consequence, no reviews have included the wide www.landesbioscience.com

but no direct effect was seen on isolated lysosomes, the effect has not been confirmed56 and 3MA did not impair the ability of lysosomes to degrade endocytosed proteins in intact cells.25 Although care should be exercised in interpreting secondary effects of 3MA, the drug can be safely used to distinguish between autophagic and nonautophagic protein degradation (Fig. 7). Some long-lived proteins appear to be degraded exclusively by autophagy,29,31 and could probably be used in specific assays of autophagic protein degradation. Measuring the decay of these slowly turning over proteins by activity assays29 or immunoprecipitation31 does not provide adequate accuracy due to the high background, but the use of a recombinant protein tagged with a suitable adduct, released and measurable upon intralysosomal hydrolysis, Figure 3.

Figure 5. Retrieval of Atg9 from the forming autophagosome (step 5 of Fig. 1). The majority of the proteins involved in formation of the sequestering vesicles appear to be retrieved because they are not found associated with the completed autophagosome or Cvt vesicle. Most of these proteins are soluble and may simply dissociate from the membrane; however, retrieval of the transmembrane protein Atg9 involves several other Atg proteins. Atg9 and Atg27 are integral membrane proteins; however, this figure does not portray their topology.

Figure 4. Cargo recognition and packaging (step 2 of Fig. 1). Macroautophagy is generally considered to be nonspecific, sequestering bulk cytoplasm; however, there are examples of specific autophagy such as the Cvt pathway and pexophagy. In the Cvt pathway, prApe1 forms a large complex that interacts with the receptor Atg19 via the prApe1 propeptide. Atg19 also binds Atg11 and these two proteins are needed to move the complex to the site of vesicle formation, the phagophore assembly site/preautophago‑ somal structure (PAS). Atg19 subsequently binds Atg8–PE, which may trigger completion of the vesicle.

discussed below. Although the autophagic lactolysis assay cannot be used in yeast cells, which have a cytoplasmic b-galactosidase, it should be universally applicable to mammalian cells. Autophagic sequestration: General principles. The most direct way of monitoring autophagic activity is by autophagic sequestration assays, which measure the accumulation of autophagocytosed cytoplasmic markers in autophagic organelles. By using markers resistant to lysosomal degradation, or by blocking lysosomal degradation with suitable inhibitors, there is no need to distinguish between the 186

various autophagic organelles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and lysosomes), or to worry about autophagic-lysosomal turnover: The initial sequestration step will be rate-limiting, and the rate of accumulation will reflect the rate of autophagic sequestration. Any endogenous or introduced cytoplasmic component can, in principle, be used in an autophagy assay, provided it is sufficiently membrane-impermeant to stay inside the autophagic organelles once it has entered. Proteins (and other high-molecular mass cytoplasmic constituents) will qualify, and can usually be quantitatively measured by immunoblotting or an enzymatic assay. Exogenous probes offer more freedom in terms of detectability (for example, by radioactivity or fluorescence), but one will need to overcome the obstacle of getting a membrane-impermeant substance into the cell across the plasma membrane. Various methods are available, such as microinjection,59 lipofection,60 electropermeabilization,61 transient surface injury (blebbing),62,63 or endocytosis followed by endosome rupture.64 A second basic requirement of a sequestration assay is the separation of autophagic vacuoles from cytosol. This can be done by homogenization of the cells in isotonic, buffered sucrose, followed by centrifugation and pelleting of the sedimentable components (including the autophagic organelles), preferably through a dense cushion to achieve a clean separation. Working with isolated hepatocytes, we have found electrodisruption in ion-free sucrose followed directly by low-speed centrifugation of the “cell corpses” through a dense cushion to be a very rapid and convenient alternative to homogenization, suitable for the processing of many small samples.61 For attached cells in culture, plasma membrane permeabilization with a pore-forming agent such as streptolysin O65 or plasma membrane lysis by gentle treatment with a detergent such as saponin66 may be used for selective extraction of cytosol. 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

Figure 6. Degradation of long‑lived and short‑lived protein in isolated rat liver cells. Rats were given [14C]valine intravenously 24 h before the isolation of hepatocytes to preferentially label long‑lived protein (A), or the isolated hepatocytes were incubated with [14C]valine for 1 h in suspension to preferentially label short‑lived protein (B). After a 30‑min preincubation (to remove soluble [14C]valine), the release of [14C]valine from labeled protein was measured in an amino acid‑free medium for maximal autophagic activity (open circles); with a complete amino acid mixture to suppress autophagy (closed circles); with the acidotropic drug propylamine (10 mM) to inhibit lysosomal activity (open squares); or with both amino acids and propylamine (closed squares). Note the large fraction of long‑lived protein degradation that is suppressed by amino acids; this fraction represents autophagy, and accounts for nearly all of the propylamine‑sensitive (lysosomal) protein degrada‑ tion.

Sequestration of cytosolic enzymes or other macromolecules. A long-lived enzyme such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which turns over exclusively by autophagy, is a suitable endogenous sequestration probe. LDH begins to accumulate in lysosomes (as part of the sedimentable cell fraction) as soon as its degradation there is blocked, for example, by an endoproteinase inhibitor such as leupeptin (Fig. 7E).29 Figure 7.

Autophagy Assays

Visualization of autophagic sequestration in the light/fluorescence microscope is achievable with dye-conjugated macromolecules (or, in principle, oligosaccharides), provided these can be introduced into cells. Schaible et al.63 showed that Texas Red-conjugated dextrans could be loaded by mechanical plasma membrane injury (glass bead rolling or syringe shearing) into Leishmania-infected mouse macrophages, where they were subsequently autophagocytosed and observable in autophagosomes and parasitophorous vacuoles (lysosomes). Stacey and Allfrey similarly visualized the autophagic sequestration of microinjected, rhodamine-conjugated proteins in HeLa cells.59 With presently available recombination technologies, the autophagic sequestration of, for example, green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a GFP-conjugated cytosolic protein,74 would seem like an attractive alternative. With any of these methods, the visibility of autophagic organelles can be greatly improved by gently permeabilizing the cells after the completion of autophagy, using, for example, electrodisruption61 or saponin treatment66 to reduce cytosolic background fluorescence. The yeast alkaline phosphatase assay. The yeast gene PHO8 encodes vacuolar alkaline phosphatase, a resident hydrolase.75 Pho8 contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain that acts as an internal uncleaved signal sequence allowing translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); like most resident vacuolar hydrolases, Pho8 is delivered to the vacuole through a portion of the secretory pathway.76 The altered Pho8D60 protein lacks the N-terminal transmembrane domain, so it is no longer able to enter the ER, and instead remains in the cytosol. The only way for Pho8D60 to reach the vacuole is through autophagy.32 If it is delivered to the vacuole, the C-terminal propeptide of Pho8D60 can be removed in a proteinase B (Prb1)-dependent manner, generating the mature active enzyme. This conversion can be conveniently measured either enzymatically (Fig. 8A) or through a molecular mass shift monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8B). Pho8D60 activity is typically very low in vegetative conditions, presumably reflecting the basal level of autophagy, and is substantially increased following induction of autophagy. Optimally, the enzyme assay should be performed in a strain that is deleted for PHO13, the gene encoding a cytosolic alkaline phosphatase, and where the PHO8 locus has been replaced with Pho8D60. One advantage of the SDS-PAGE assay is that processing can be followed in a strain deleted only for PHO8 (this deletion is not essential but is helpful because mature Pho8 migrates at the same position as unprocessed Pho8D60), where Pho8D60 is expressed on a plasmid; however, anti-Pho8 antiserum is required. Because the sequestration step is rate limiting in the sequence of events that ultimately results in Pho8D60 activation, the Pho8D60 assay may serve as a measure of autophagic sequestration in yeast cells; however, because the assay depends on delivery of Pho8D60 to the vacuole, it will not detect autophagic sequestration in the absence of autophagosome-vacuole fusion. Atg8/LC3‑II accumulation. Atg8 and its mammalian homologue, LC3, are unique markers of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, in that their lipidated (phosphatidylethanolamine [PE]-conjugated) forms (LC3-II in mammalian cells) appear to be predominantly associated with autophagic organelles.77,78 In mammalian cells, forced expression of GFP-conjugated LC3-II has been widely used to detect autophagic organelles in the microscope as fluorescent dots appearing, for example, upon amino acid starvation.50 The advantage of GFP-LC3-II as an autophagy marker, compared to sequestered cytosolic enzymes, is that the cytoplasmic background is low, thus obviating the need to permeabilize or fractionate the cells, although 188

the removal of cytosol will improve detectability.66 It is important to note, however, that caution must be exercised when interpreting data from analysis of GFP-LC3 due to the tendency of LC3-GFP to aggregate.79 In particular overexpression resulting from transient transfection, or expression in the presence of intracellular protein aggregates (such as polyQ-associated inclusion bodies) can lead to LC3 punctate structures that do not represent autophagosomes.79 By blocking its lysosomal degradation with proteinase inhibitors, Atg8–PE/LC3-II will, like sequestered cytosolic enzymes, accumulate within the vacuole/lysosome, thus offering a potential means of quantifying autophagic activity.80 Quantification can be performed 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

by densitometric scanning of western blots,80 or by counting the number of fluorescent dots per cell (counting the fraction of Atg8– PE/LC3-II-positive cells is also used, but is much less accurate).66 However, there are several problems connected with the interpretation of Atg8–PE/LC3-II accumulation: Atg8–PE/LC3-II is associated with all types of autophagic organelles, including the preautophagosomal phagophores,78 and its formation/lipidation/delipidation kinetics are not well understood, a problem compounded by the often poor detectability of the unlipidated form, LC3-I, by currently available antibodies.81 The sequestration step (autophagosome formation) is, therefore, not necessarily rate-limiting for Atg8–PE/ LC3-II accumulation, hence the accumulation does not necessarily reflect the rate of autophagic sequestration. Furthermore, it is not clear whether all autophagosome-associated LC3-II enters the lysosome, or whether LC3-II on the outer autophagosomal surface78 is disposed of (delipidated and degraded) by nonlysosomal mechanisms, as is the case with Atg8–PE. Unlike the autophagic sequestration of cytosolic www.landesbioscience.com

markers, or overall autophagic-lysosomal protein degradation, the rate of Atg8–PE/LC3-II accumulation tends to decline rapidly,66,80 probably reflecting the fact that it is influenced by several processes other than autophagic sequestration. Accumulation of autophagic organelles. One of the most widely used ways to monitor autophagy is by the counting of autophagic organelles. The counting of GFP-LC3-positive dots in the fluorescence microscope has already been discussed; more traditional methods include the quantification of lysosomes (which are turned into larger and more active autolysosomes during autophagy) in the fluorescence microscope after staining82,83 or of autophagosomes and other autophagic organelles in the electron microscope.24,48 Apart from the problems associated with unequivocal organelle identification, discussed below, these morphological methods are at best semi-quantitative, in that they usually measure the steady-state levels of organelles within a continuous autophagic-lysosomal flux rather than a sequestration-dependent end-stage accumulation. Under such conditions, an accumulation of, for example, autophagosomes, would not necessarily reflect an increase in autophagic activity, but could equally well be due to a reduced fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes or lysosomes.84 The fact that the autophagiclysosomal pathway is characterized by a series of fusions means that morphometric recordings of the volume fractions of autophagic compartments are more meaningful than the counting of organelle numbers, but maximum information is obtained by doing both.85 It should be emphasized, however, that even the volume fractions are strongly flux-dependent, and, moreover, subject to influence by endocytic influx independent of autophagic activity. In yeast cells, several adequate morphological end-point assays are actually available: In strains defective in fusion with the vacuole, such as ypt7D or vam3D, the accumulation of autophagosomes can be observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 9A), or more easily by monitoring GFP-Atg8 fluorescence. The accumulation of autophagosomes in a wild type strain would indicate a defect in fusion. A second morphological yeast autophagy assay is based on autophagic bodies, the single-membrane intravacuolar vesicles that result from the fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuolar limiting membrane (Fig. 1). Autophagic bodies are normally degraded within the vacuole lumen in a process that is dependent on Prb1 activity;86 presumably, Prb1 is needed to activate other hydrolases that act directly upon the autophagic body lipid membrane. The vacuoles of wild type cells appear essentially devoid of autophagic bodies, whereas these structures accumulate under starvation conditions (or following treatment with rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits Tor kinase resulting in autophagic induction) in strains lacking Pep4 or Prb1 activity, or in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. The appearance of autophagic bodies can be detected by light microscopy in yeast due to the relatively large size of the vacuole; this analysis is not practical for mammalian cells due to the smaller size of the lysosome. Analysis of autophagic body accumulation is a simple, but very qualitative (because it is usually done as a static analysis, and it is difficult to determine the actual number of autophagic bodies in the entire vacuole), assay for autophagy. In addition, the absence of autophagic bodies (comparing cells in the absence and presence of inhibitors) can be used as a measure of vesicle lysis, or, more precisely, breakdown. Quantification of autophagic body accumulation and size is possible when the analysis is carried out with electron microscopy (Fig. 9B). It may be helpful to delete the VPS4 gene to prevent the appearance of intravacuolar vesicles derived from the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the vacuole. 189

inhibitiOn Of AutOPhAgy
The autophagic-lysosomal pathway can be blocked at several points;28,30,87 each block providing important information about an individual step in the pathway. To assess the secondary consequences of autophagy, a complete shutdown of the whole pathway may be desirable, which is most cleanly achieved by blocking autophagy at or before the sequestration step. Several agents, genetic manipulations and conditions are available for this purpose, each with its characteristic spectrum of side effects, thus allowing a choice of minimal complications relative to the secondary process one wants to investigate. Amino acids. Increased protein degradation in response to amino acid deficiency is a major function of autophagy, making amino acids both the most important physiological inhibitors of autophagy and a useful experimental tool.88 Probably the most common way of turning autophagy off and on in experimental studies with mammalian cells is by switching cell cultures between a rich medium containing serum and high levels of amino acids (which cooperate at several levels in suppressing autophagy), and a nutrient-poor medium (buffered saline). This is not a very clean experimental approach, however, because several autophagy-regulatory signaling pathways may be altered at the same time: The removal of serum growth factors switches off the autophagy-suppressive pathway dependent on PtdIns 3-kinase class I,73 and if an energy substrate (glucose or pyruvate) is not included, a decline in the ATP/AMP ratio may switch on an autophagy-regulatory metabolic stress pathway dependent on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).89 To obtain a pure nitrogen starvation (amino acid) effect, serum proteins and glucose should be included in the starvation medium, or a comparison should be made between cells reincubated in the presence or absence of amino acids. Although a complete, balanced amino acid mixture is usually employed for autophagy suppression,48,90 not all amino acids are autophagy-suppressive, meaning that simpler mixtures of regulatory amino acids can be used.90-92 Leucine clearly plays a major role,46,91 and tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine also contribute significantly to the inhibition of autophagic sequestration in hepatocytes.93 In addition, asparagine partially inhibits amphisome-lysosome fusion;30,94 glutamine inhibits intralysosomal protein degradation by acting as an ammonia donor,95 and alanine modulates the effect of the other amino acids by an as yet undefined mechanism.96 The suppression of autophagic sequestration by amino acids is poorly understood: although the rapamycin-sensitive lipid/protein kinase, mTOR, clearly plays a major role,88 the effects of amino acids on autophagy are not always rapamycin-sensitive,97 and the additive or synergistic effects of amino acids in different combinations93 may indicate that several mechanisms are operative. Given the specific metabolic profiles of different cell types, their sensitivities towards autophagy-suppressive amino acids are also likely to differ, hence no universally effective set of regulatory amino acids has yet been devised.98 For the time being, a complete, balanced amino acid mixture is probably the best choice. It should be noted, however, that because amino acids are rapidly metabolized, their autophagysuppressive effect is less sustained than the effect of, for example, 3MA, discussed below.99 3‑methyladenine and other PtdIns 3‑kinase inhibitors. The autophagy-suppressive effects of 3MA and some other methylaminopurines and mercaptopurines61,100 were originally discovered on the basis of a side effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor, puromycin, on protein degradation.101,102 As discussed above, high concentrations 190

of 3MA (5–10 mM) will block autophagic sequestration completely in all mammalian cell types studied (Fig. 7), with litte or no effect on other endogenous degradation mechanisms or on basic cellular functions such as energy metabolism, protein synthesis or cellular viability.25,51 However, 3MA may interfere with other cellular processes independent of autophagy,53-56 hence its secondary effects must be interpreted with caution. 3MA has been shown to be a PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor,52 and probably blocks autophagic sequestration by inhibiting the class III PtdIns 3-kinase, mVps34.73 Other PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors, such as wortmannin and LY294002, are more potent autophagy suppressants than 3MA,52 but they are also strong inhibitors of class I PtdIns 3-kinases and thus likely to be less specific. Vps34 is required for phagophore formation in yeast103,104 and appears to be involved in the regulation of mammalian autophagy as well,105,106 although its precise role remains to be clarified. Okadaic acid and related toxins. Okadaic acid and several other protein phosphatase-inhibitory algal toxins have been found to suppress autophagic sequestration completely in isolated rat hepatocytes.67,107 The toxin effects appear to be mediated by overphosphorylation of the AMP-activated-protein kinase (AMPK), are shared by the AMPK activator, AICAR,89 and are accompanied by extensive fragmentation of the cellular keratin and plectin cytoskeleton networks.108,109 How these cytoskeletal alterations relate to the suppression of autophagy is not clear, but the possibility should be considered that the autophagy suppression may be secondary, in particular because AMPK has been found to have the opposite (stimulatory) effect on autophagy in yeast.110 Although the toxins are remarkably effective autophagy suppressants, their protein phosphatase-inhibitory properties induce a generalized overphosphorylation of cellular proteins111 and eventually apoptotic cell death,112 making them probably the least specific of the autophagy suppressants available. Thapsigargin and calcium chelators. Autophagic sequestration can be virtually completely suppressed by thapsigargin and other inhibitors of the calcium pump in the ER.113 These drugs cause a rapid depletion of calcium from the ER cisternae, an effect that to some extent can be mimicked by calcium chelators. Nothing is known about why intracisternal calcium is required for autophagy, but an attractive possibility is that it needs to be present in the intracisternal space of the sequestering phagophore. This inhibitory effect may also conform with the view that at least one source of the phagophore and autophagosome membrane is the ER/early secretory pathway. Cyclic AMP. High concentrations of cAMP have been shown to suppress autophagy both in yeast114,115 and in mammalian cells.116,117 The effect of the cyclic nucleotide is apparently mediated by protein kinase A, which can phosphorylate several of the proteins (Atg1, Atg13 and Atg18) involved in phagophore formation.118 In hepatocytes, cell-permeable cAMP analogues (dibutyryl-cAMP), activators of adenylyl cyclase (forskolin) and inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterases (theophylline; 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) can suppress autophagic sequestration virtually completely without affecting, for example, general energy metabolism,116 which may make them useful as inhbitors of the overall autophagic-lysosomal pathway. Acidotropic amines. Acidotropic drugs have long been known to disturb lysosomal function by acting as intralysosomal protontrapping agents that raise the lysosomal pH and hence suppress the activity of lysosomal acid hydrolases.87,119 The discovery that ammonia could inhibit a major fraction of endogenous proteolysis 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

Figure 10. The Atg7 cysteine to serine (C to S) mutation can be used to monitor function of the Atg7 protein. Pichia pastoris cells transformed with HA‑tagged wild type or mutant Atg7 were grown in methanol‑containing medium and then adapted to glucose for 3 h. Aliquots were solubilized in 2% SDS and boiled for 3 min (‑DTT) or solubilized in SDS with 1.5% DTT and boiled for 5 min (+DTT). Following SDS‑PAGE, the samples were probed with anti‑HA antibodies to detect HA‑tagged Atg7. The C to S mutation allows the detection of the Atg7–Atg12 ester intermediate even in the presence of DTT.

by functioning as a lysosomotropic inhibitor95,120,121 was in fact a crucial argument for the involvement of lysosomes in intracellular protein degradation and for the delineation of the autophagiclysosomal pathway.45,122,123 The addition of 10–20 mM NH4Cl is still a widely used, and very effective, method for inhibition of autophagic-lysosomal protein degradation, not only via macroautophagy but through all types of autophagic pathways. Other weak bases, like methylamine and propylamine, are as effective as ammonia,124 and have the advantage of being metabolically inert, thus not disturbing cellular nitrogen metabolism. Chloroquine, on the other hand, also widely used as a lysosomotropic agent, is a reactive drug with enzyme-inhibitory effects in addition to its acidotropic properties.119 All lysosomotropic amines will, however, induce swelling of lysosomes and other acidic compartments, thus interfering with cellular processes such as endocytosis,125 secretion126 and even locomotion.127 Genetic knockouts and knockdowns. Because the ATG genes are essential for autophagy in yeast, mutational knockouts of these genes will not only affect the individual step regulated by the respective protein, but will also usually block the whole autophagiclysosomal (vacuolar) pathway.128,129 Certain atg knockouts have been found to suppress autophagy in mammalian (mouse) cells as well as in yeast; this is the case with the mammalian ATG6 homologue, beclin 1130 and the mammalian ATG5 and ATG7 homologues (the latter two being generated with a Cre/flox system).50,131,132 However, the formation of some autophagosome-like structures was still detectable in cells from homozygous Atg5 knockout mice,50 suggesting, perhaps, that the Atg requirements may not be as stringent in mammalian cells as in yeast cells. The recent introduction of the use of small interfering RNAi for blocking protein expression in mammalian cells has allowed efficient supression of autophagy in cultured mammalian cells by targeting Atg8/LC3, Atg6/Beclin 1 and the mammalian homologues of Atg5, Atg10 and Atg12.133,134 Some aspects to consider in the application of this approach for blocking autophagy include those related to the use of RNAi in general (i.e., off target effects, stability of the blockage, etc.). Mutational knockouts of genes encoding important autophagyinducing protein kinases may also have the potential to block the entire autophagic-lysosomal pathway. Thus, knockout of the yeast eIF2α kinase, Gcn2, completely blocks nitrogen starvation-induced www.landesbioscience.com

autophagy in yeast cells, and knockout of the mammalian eIF2α kinase, PKR, blocks the induction of autophagy in mouse fibroblasts by HSV-1 virus.135 Similarly, dominant-negative mutations in death-associated protein kinases (DAPKs) prevent autophagy induction by nitrogen starvation and other stimuli in various mammalian cells.136 Active site cysteine to serine mutation. In most organisms autophagy employs two conjugation systems involving the ubiquitin-like proteins Atg8 and Atg12 (Fig. 3).12 Conjugation of Atg8 requires, in order of function, Atg4 (cysteine protease), Atg7 (activating enzyme) and Atg3 (conjugating enzyme) to covalently attach PE. Conjugation of Atg12 requires Atg7 and Atg10 (conjugating enzyme) to covalently attach Atg5. Various assays can be used to ascertain the functionality of each step of the process (Table 2). Atg7 forms a thioester intermediate with Atg8 and Atg12 independently. The Atg7–Atg12 intermediate can be detected by removing the reducing agent during sample preparation and SDS-PAGE, or more easily by using a mutant where the active site cysteine residue has been replaced by a serine, resulting in a stable ester bond (Fig. 10),137,138 verifying the functionality of Atg7 and to some extent that of Atg12. Mutation of the active site cysteine to serine in Atg3 was used to detect a stable interaction between Atg3 and Atg8, although in this case it was also necessary to overexpress Atg7 to generate a sufficient pool of activated Atg8.139 A similar mutation in Atg10 allowed the detection of the normally transient Atg10–Atg12 intermediate in yeast140 and mice,141 and the same approach was used to form a stable intermediate between Atg7 and the three mammalian Atg8 homologues, LC3, GATE-16 and GABARAP.142 Finally, it should be noted that interactions between substrates and particular components of the conjugation machinery can also be detected through yeast two-hybrid assays.143,144

Atg8/LC3, a general marker of autophagic organelles. The most widely used autophagic organelle marker at present is Atg8 and its mammalian homologue, LC3; often expressed as the respective fluorescent GFP conjugates. Prior to lipidation, GFP-Atg8 is dispersed within the cytosol. Thus, dispersed GFP-Atg8 can be seen in mutants that are defective in the Atg8 conjugation reaction (Fig. 11A), and also in mutants defective in Atg12 conjugation where Atg8–PE is unstable. Although it is not known where conjugation occurs, the lipidated protein GFP-Atg8–PE, is commonly used to mark the phagophore assembly site/preautophagosomal structure (PAS, Fig. 11A; see below). Atg8–PE is one of two Atg proteins that have been shown to remain associated with the completed autophagosome or the equivalent vesicles used in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway (Fig. 1), and thus also serves as a marker for these structures (the other is Atg19, which is only present in yeast). For example, in mutants defective in fusion with the vacuole, including ypt7D or vam3D, GFP-Atg8–PE accumulates within autophagosomes. In wild type cells, GFP-Atg8–PE can be seen dispersed within the vacuole lumen, serving as a general marker for delivery via the Cvt or autophagy pathways. It can also be detected inside Cvt or autophagic bodies in strains that are defective in intravacuolar vesicle breakdown such as pep4D (Fig. 11B). Thus, the GFP-Atg8 chimera can be used to follow the localization or accumulation of autophagosomes, the PAS or autophagic bodies, depending on the conditions or strains being monitored. 191

The cells were grown to mid log stage in SMD medium and then labeled with FM 4‑64 (to stain the vacuole), shifted to SD‑N medium for 3 h, and examined by confocal microscopy. In atg1D cells, GFP‑Atg8 is recruited to punctate structures, whereas in the Atg8 processing‑defective atg4D cells, GFP‑Atg8 appears uniformly distributed in the cytosol.

As with Atg8, GFP-LC3 can be used to monitor the localization of the protein.37 An increase in GFP-LC3 punctate dots may reflect the induction of autophagy and also the function of the vesicle-forming machinery (Fig. 12). Two different counting methods have been used to quantify the appearance of GFP-LC3 puncta: The number of GFP-LC3-positive dots per cell and the number of cells with positive dots. The former is probably more representative of the extent of autophagy. GFP-LC3 punctate dots mostly mark autophagosomes and phagophores37 but are also associated with (auto)lysosomes as confirmed by counterstaining GFP-LC3-expressing cells with anti-CD63 (endosomal/lysosomal marker) antibody followed by indirect immunofluorescence.145 Furthermore, a portion of the lysosome-associated LC3, which is localized on the cytosolic side of the lysosomal membrane, seems quite stable in this location, and may not be a direct reflection of the extent of autophagy, as it can be detected at this site even when macroautophagy is blocked for 4 hours (Kaushik S, Wang Y, Martinez-Vicente M, Cuervo AM, unpublished results). Overexpression of GFP-LC3 does not appear to interfere with autophagy, so the chimeric marker can be used in transient transfections, although transgenic mice expressing GFP-LC3 have recently been generated.146 It is possible to use other fluorescent protein-tagged Atg proteins in mammalian cells, and presumably in other systems. Fluorescent chimeras of Atg5, Atg6/Beclin 1 and Atg16 have been observed in mammalian cells.50,143,147,148 In general, care should be exercised to determine whether the altered expression of an Atg protein(s) causes a change in the level of autophagy. Atg8 and LC3 are often upregulated during autophagy (Fig. 13) and they remain associated with the completed autophagosome; however, in pathological conditions in which autophagosome clearance is impaired and autophagosomes persist longer in the cytosol, it is possible to find autophagosomes denuded of surface LC3, suggesting that the protein may eventually be detached from the membrane of this vesicle, in agreement with the Atg4-dependent removal of Atg8 from the outer surface of the autophago- Figure 12.

of autophagy including vesicle formation, fusion with the lysosome/vacuole or degradation of the autophagic body, which would cause the protein to accumulate. Accordingly, it is necessary to monitor turnover of these proteins in the absence and presence of lysosomal/vacuolar protease inhibitors, as opposed to simply following the steady state level.80 For example, in HeLa cells in the Figure 13. LC3‑I conversion and LC3‑II turnover. HEK293 and HeLa cells were cultured in nutrient‑rich medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS) or incubated for 4 h in starvation conditions (Krebs‑Ringer absence of protease inhibitors the level of medium) in the absence (‑) or presence (+) of E64d and pepstatin at 10 mg/ml each (Inhibitors).

Finally, Rab24 has also been proposed recently as a possible autophagic marker; in response to starvation this protein relocates from its usual ER-Golgi location to cup- and ring-shaped vesicular structures that are positive for LC3.150 The phagophore assembly site (preautophagosomal structure; PAS). In yeast cells, a number of Atg proteins have been found, by immunostaining or GFP conjugation, to colocalize to a dot-like organelle known as the phagophore assembly site or preautophagosomal structure (PAS).151,152 The PAS apparently functions as an assembly site, from which nascent phagophores (isolation membranes) emanate in the form of membrane vesicles or cisternae equipped with autophagy-specific proteins and protein conjugates.13 The PAS is not membrane-enclosed,153 and is difficult to recognize in the electron microscope, but is easily detected in the fluorescence microscope as the major site of concentrated Atg localization (Fig. 11A). Almost any Atg protein (Atg1, Atg2, Atg7, Atg9, etc.) can serve as a PAS marker, preferably those not associated with other autophagic or nonautophagic organelles (Atg5, Atg8, Atg12, Atg16, Atg19); although in practice, most Atg proteins are detected primarily at the PAS. The primary exceptions that should be avoided as PAS markers are Atg9, Atg23 and Atg27, which localize to the PAS, but also to additional sites within the cell (Yen W-L, Legakis JE, Klionsky DJ, unpublished results).21,154,155 No clear equivalent of the PAS has yet been observed in mammalian cells, perhaps indicating that phagophore assembly takes place in a more distributed fashion than in yeast cells. Phagophores. In mammalian cells, phagophores are easily recognized ultrastructurally as compressed (electron-dense), curving cisternae in the process of enclosing part of the cytoplasm. The same structural appearance is observed in the walls (delimiting membranes) of completed autophagosomes, which derive from the Figure 14. Autophagic organelles in rat hepatocytes.

as specific phagophore markers.50 Although Atg5 is diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, a GFP-Atg5 conjugate (expressed in Atg5-deficient cells) is sufficiently concentrated on phagophores to make these organelles detectable as dots or crescent-shaped structures in the fluorescence microscope. In the electron microscope, early phagophores can be recognized as heavily Atg5-immunogold-labeled, crescent-shaped vesicles that eventually expand to enclose a portion of the cytoplasm.50 The expansion phase probably involves the coalescence of smaller vesicles into large cisternal sheets.156 In some cells, large phagophores can be observed as stacks or compacted balls, possibly representing storage forms that are unpacked upon the initiation of sequestration.85,99 Atg8/LC3 is also associated with phagophores, anchored as a lipid conjugate (LC3-II in mammalian cells), and may serve as a phagophore marker in the electron microscope. Gold-immunolabelling of Atg8 has thus been used to identify yeast phagophores,158 which have otherwise been less well characterized than in mammalian cells. In the light microscope, the association of Atg8/LC3 with Cvt vesicles (in yeast cells) as well as with completed autophagic organelles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and lysosomes/vacuoles) precludes its use as a specific visual phagophore marker. In biochemical studies (subcellular fractionation and western blotting), on the other hand, Atg8/LC3 may be a useful marker of any autophagic organelle, including the phagophore. Autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are easily recognized in the electron microscope by their contents of completely normal cytoplasm, morphologically indistinguishable from the surrounding cellular environment. Any contents alteration indicates that fusion with an endosome or a phagosome has occurred, causing cytoplasmic denaturation and turning the organelle into an amphisome or (auto)lysosome.16 The autophagosome is delimited by a compressed, electron-dense cisterna (derived from the phagophore) that is often (artificially) swollen to reveal the appearance of a double membrane (sometimes multiple, if several stacked phagophores have performed the sequestration; Fig. 14B).85,157 The double membrane is often used as a defining criterion for the autophagosome, which may be misleading, because membranes that are part of the contents of amphisomes or lysosomes may often be apposed to their delimiting membrane, giving a false “double membrane” impression. In freeze-fracture ultrastructural studies, autophagosomes can be recognized by their smooth (particle-free) delimiting membranes.157,159 There is no specific biochemical marker that will distinguish autophagosomes from other autophagic organelles. In the absence of good ultrastructure (light/fluorescence microscopy, cryoelectron microscopy), it is, therefore, necessary to use a combination of positive and negative markers to make the desired distinctions. For example, in cryoelectron microscopy immunogold labeling studies, a relatively degradation-resistant cytosolic enzyme such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) can be used to mark all autophagic vacuolar organelles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and autolysosomes); an endocytosed protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) to mark endosomes, amphisomes and lysosomes; and a lysosomal membrane protein, for example, lysosome associated membrane protein type 1 or 2 (LAMP-1 or -2), to mark autophagolysosomes and lysosomes. The combination of positive and negative markers will then identify endosomes (SOD-/BSA+/LAMP-), autophagosomes (SOD+/BSA-/LAMP-), amphisomes (SOD+/BSA+/LAMP-), autolysosomes (SOD+/BSA±/LAMP+) and heterolysosomes (SOD-/ BSA+/LAMP+).85 A similar approach can be applied to fluorescence microscopy studies, using, for example, LC3-II, as a marker 194

for all types of autophagic vacuolar organelles, an acidotropic dye (for example, acridine orange, LysoTracker Red or monodansylcadaverine) to mark acidic organelles (endosomes, amphisomes and lysosomes), and a lysosomal membrane protein marker to identify the lysosomes. Acid hydrolases (cathepsins, acid phosphatase) are also frequently used as lysosome markers, but as with the LAMPs, they may be present at low levels in endosomes and amphisomes as well.160 In summary, there is not yet a single marker for each of the autophagic and endocytic compartments that could be used to highlight a particular organelle, but combinations of multiple markers, such as the ones described here, taking into account their enrichment in particular compartments, are helping to track the autophagic process in mammalian cells. Purification of autophagosomes. Density gradient methods have a long-standing tradition as a means of separating autophagic organelles from cytosol and other cytoplasmic fractions.161-163 Whereas sucrose gradients are hypertonic in the relevant density range, tending to cause most organelles to cluster in the same region of the gradient, isotonic gradients of Percoll or iodinated compounds like metrizamide, nycodenz or iodixanol provide a good separation of autophagic organelles from mitochondria.27,164,165 Autophagosomes, amphisomes and lysosomes have similar densities, but the lysosomes can be eliminated by selective, substrate-mediated lysis.166 By combining such lysis with the stepwise application of various gradient media, and by using the fusion inhibitor vinblastine to specifically induce the accumulation of autophagosomes, a procedure for the preparation of very pure autophagosomes from rat liver cells has been developed.165 Amphisomes. Amphisomes are autophagic/endocytic organelles formed by the fusion between autophagosomes and early or late endosomes.94,167 Because this organelle both contains acid hydrolases and a proton pump contributed by the endosomal fusion partner,58 its cytoplasmic contents are rapidly denatured, making the amphisome ultrastructurally different from its surrounding cytoplasm, unlike the autophagosome. The presence of a single, thin delimiting membrane, and of endosomal markers, may further aid to distinguish amphisomes from autophagosomes (Fig. 14C).85 However, to distinguish amphisomes from early (auto)lysosomes with moderately degraded cytoplasmic contents, the absence of lysosomal markers is the only criterion available. As discussed above, enrichment in specific lysosomal membrane proteins is more useful for this purpose than enrichment in acid hydrolases. Amphisomes can be partially purified by a modification of the autophagosome preparation procedure,165 using partial inhibitors of amphisome-lysosome fusion (leupeptin or asparagine) rather than vinblastine to induce autophagic organelle accumulation. The resulting preparation from rat liver cells has been shown to be a 50:50 mixture of amphisomes and autophagosomes.167 Lysosomes. As the end destination of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, lysosomes are frequently used to monitor autophagy. Needless to say, not all lysosomal changes are due to autophagy, but in those experimental situations where marked alterations in autophagic activity are known to take place, they will usually be reflected in corresponding alterations in the lysosomal population, which may consequently serve as a proxy measure of autophagy. When autophagy is switched on, both the number and average volume of lysosomes will usually rise, but not necessarily proportionally, making the overall volume fraction of the lysosomal compartment (or, better still, the volume fraction of the total autophagic-lysosomal compartment) the most appropriate indicator.48,84 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

It must be emphasized that acidotropic dyes not only stain lysosomes, but also other acidic organelles, such as endosomes and amphisomes, albeit (usually) with lower intensity, reflecting the higher average pH of the latter. Presumably, an increased endocytic influx to the lysosomes may stimulate proton pumping and promote lysosomal acidity much like autophagy. It is, therefore, important to carry out additional, and more specific tests for autophagy to verify that any detected structures are truly reflecting an autophagic response. Although MDC was originally reported to be a specific marker for autophagic organelles in general,176 this acidotropic dye does not stain autophagosomes, which are neutral, and subsequent studies have made it clear that it is not specific for autolysosomes either, but will stain lysosomes in general.37,145 A number of methods for lysosome purification have been described. We have found it convenient to apply the autophagosome preparation procedure165 (omitting, obviously, the lysosome lysis step) to cells pretreated with 3-methyladenine to suppress the formation of autophagosomes and amphisomes. The result is a very pure preparation of lysosomes.167

Lysosomes are extremely heterogeneous with regard to ultrastructure, and can assume almost any size or shape, posing, for example, as lamellar bodies, storage granules or tubular “nematolysosomes” (Fig. 14D).168 Inactive lysosomes can usually be recognized in the electron microscope as small, electron-dense organelles, and autolysosomes by their contents of cytoplasmic material at various stages of degradation. Active autolysosomes have a lower density than the small, inactive lysosomes, allowing the progression of autophagy to be monitored as a lysosomal density shift in isotonic gradients.169 The lysosomal degradation stage (the time since the autophagic input) can be measured quite precisely as the intralysosomal ratio between a rapidly degraded cytosolic enzyme such as carbonic anhydrase III and a poorly degradable enzyme such as CuZn-superoxide dismutase.85,170 “Early” lysosomes cannot, however, be distinguished from amphisomes unless a lysosomal membrane protein is included as a marker. In the absence of autophagy, active lysosomes (“endolysosomes” or “phagolysosomes”) may be morphologically indistinguishable from endosomes, becasue even completely electron-lucent vacuoles may be lysosomal in nature. The burden of an increased autophagic influx will tend to stimulate lysosomal proton pumping, thus establishing a correlation between autophagic activity and overall lysosomal acidity under some conditions. A number of fluorescent acidotropic dyes are available for staining of lysosomes on the basis of acidity, such as acridine orange (AO),171 LysoSensor Blue DND-167,172 monodansylcadaverine (MDC)173 and LysoTracker Red.174 These dyes are able to cross the lysosomal membrane as uncharged molecules, but become protonated and trapped in the acidic interior of the lysosome.87 The intensity of lysosomal staining, detected by fluorescence microscopy, will be roughly proportional to lysosomal acidity. Because the general increase in lysosomal acidity accompanying increased autophagy will increase the detectability of the lysosomes, quantification can be performed by counting the number of detectable lysosomes per cell (Fig. 15)175 as well as by measuring the overall fluorescence intensity. www.landesbioscience.com

Induction: Tor and the Atg1‑Atg13 protein kinase complex. The switching on of autophagy upon nitrogen (amino acid) starvation or growth factor deprivation appears to be mediated by inhibition of the Tor protein kinase in yeast as well as in mammalian cells.88,114 In yeast, both a stimulation of de novo phagophore formation (through Atg gene expression) and an activation of preexisting phagophores (cycloheximide-resistant autophagy) appears to be involved;10,177 in mammalian cells an activation mechanism would seem to predominate, because autophagy can proceed at a high rate in the absence of new protein synthesis (i.e., in the presence of cycloheximide) for a considerable length of time.102 Tor is ivolved in too many cellular activities to serve as a meaningful autophagy indicator on its own, but its downstream effects on Atg13 and (secondarily) Atg1 are quite autophagy-specific. Atg13 is part of a putative multi-protein complex that includes the protein kinase Atg1,178,179 and Atg13 appears to modulate Atg1 kinase activity.180 In addition, Atg13 is a phosphoprotein that undergoes rapid changes in phosphorylation in response to nutrient conditions;179,180 Atg13 is hyperphosphorylated in rich media and partially dephosphorylated when autophagy is induced (Fig. 16). The phosphorylation is mediated by Tor kinase, but it is not known whether this is direct or indirect. At present, an Atg13 homolog has not been positively identified in higher eukaryotes except for plants. In yeast, however, monitoring Atg13 dephosphorylation would appear to be an adequate way of following induction. Atg1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase;181 kinase activity has been measured in vitro180 and its autophosphorylation activity both in vitro181 and in vivo.182 The in vitro kinase assay has shown that maximal activity requires Atg13, Atg17 and even Atg11,180 all of which are thought to interact with Atg1. The main drawback of either assay at present is that the in vivo targets of Atg1 are not completely known. Accordingly, the in vitro assay uses myelin basic protein as an artificial substrate. The putative mammalian Atg1 homologs, Ulk1 and Ulk2, have so far not been shown to play clear roles in autophagy, although movement of mammalian Atg9 is influenced by Ulk1.182a The major function of the Atg1-Atg13 complex 195

may be in the acquisition and processing of membrane material for phagophore formation, see below. Acquisition of phagophore membrane: Role of Atg9. The source of membrane material for phagophore formation has always been a controversial question: In mammalian cells, rough and smooth ER, Golgi cisternae and the plasma membrane have all been suggested as membrane sources, but the issue is still unresolved. In yeast, the transmembrane protein, Atg9 and the peripheral membrane protein, Atg23 shuttle between the PAS and other cellular locations such as the mitochondria and the ER, and are probably involved in the transport of membrane material from these sources to the PAS.18,21 Whereas most of the Atg proteins reside at least transiently at the PAS, and can only be detected by fluorescence microscopy at this site,151,152 Atg9 and Atg23 display localization in multiple peripheral punctate structures in addition to the PAS (Fig. 17).154,155 Both proteins appear to undergo a cycling process whereby they transit between these two locations.183 The retrieval of Atg9 and Atg23 from the PAS requires Atg1; in an atg1D strain, both proteins accumulate at the PAS (Fig. 17). This finding makes it possible to perform an epistasis assay to determine whether a protein functions in Atg9 localization prior to Atg1.184,185 That is, if a second mutation in the atg1D background causes Atg9 to display its localization in multiple dots, the respective protein presumably acts before Atg1 and is required for Atg9 delivery to the PAS (anterograde transit). Conversely, if Atg9 accumulates at the PAS in the double mutant strain, the other protein would act at the same stage or after Atg1 (retrograde transit). The assay consists of monitoring the transport of Atg9 after knocking out ATG1 (TAKA assay), using a fluorescent Atg9 chimera, and is typically carried out in a double mutant strain, where one of the mutations is atg1D. Atg8 synthesis. Atg8/LC3 plays a key role both in the autophagic process and as a marker protein for autophagy. Although formation of small autophagosomes and some low, basal autophagic activity is detectable in its absence,50,158,177,186 Atg8/LC3 is required for phagophore expansion, the formation of large autophagosomes and a high rate of autophagy. In yeast, this requires new protein synthesis,86,177 and among the several Atg proteins upregulated during autophagy, the greatest change in expression is seen with Atg8.158,187 The levels of this protein may increase by 10-fold or more under starvation conditions.188 Monitoring the change in total Atg8 levels is thus one way to follow the induction of autophagy in yeast (in mammalian cells, the pool of preexisting LC3 is apparently sufficient to keep autophagy going for quite a while, as discussed above). There is, however, one important caveat to keep in mind with regard to this 196

Wild type and atg1D strains carrying a genomic Atg9‑RFP fusion were grown to mid log phase in SMD medium and imaged by fluorescence microscopy.

approach. Because Atg8 is degraded in the vacuole while new Atg8 protein is being synthesized, it is problematic to use this method to measure autophagy through western blotting, unless degradation is inhibited (as discussed above). That is, a high level of Atg8 would indicate that autophagy has been induced, but it could also reflect a block in the later stages of the process. By examining Atg8 levels in the presence and absence of a vacuolar protease inhibitor, it is possible to look at both the change in Atg8 levels and the turnover of the protein. In other words, a high level of Atg8–PE in the presence of protease inhibitor but a lower level in its absence would indicate both autophagic induction and normal turnover of Atg8 within the vacuole, further reflecting normal fusion of autophagosomes and breakdown of the autophagic body in addition to degradation of Atg8. Atg12–Atg5 conjugation. The binding of Atg8/LC3 to the phagophore membrane is dependent on the presence of an Atg12– Atg5-Atg16 complex. Atg12 (21 kDa) is an ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently attached to Atg5 (34 kDa), forming a higher molecular mass conjugate (70 kDa).189 This process is dependent upon the Atg7 (activating enzyme) and Atg10 (conjugating enzyme) proteins. Atg5 and Atg12 do not appear to be highly antigenic (personal observations); however, either protein can be epitope-tagged for detection by western blotting. Tagging at the C terminus of Atg12 should be avoided because the C-terminal glycine is involved in the conjugation reaction. Atg8/LC3 processing and delipidation: Role of Atg4. In order to attach to the phagophore membrane, Atg8 needs to be proteolytically processed and conjugated to PE. The processing is performed by the cysteine proteinase Atg4, which removes a C-terminal arginine to expose the penultimate glycine, making Atg8 susceptible to activation by Atg7. Atg4 also removes PE from the Atg8–PE that is located on the outer surface of the completed autophagosome. Fusion of GFP to the C terminus of Atg8 allows the detection of Atg4 function in the cytosol; the appearance of free GFP, or the disappearance of full-length Atg8-GFP indicates Atg4 activity (Fig. 18).190 The mammalian homolog of Atg8, LC3, undergoes a similar C-terminal processing event to that seen with Atg8.78 A C-terminal processing assay can be used to analyze mammalian Atg4 homologues by carrying out in vitro reactions with purified Atg4 and 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot using antiserum to Atg8 (top panel) or GFP (bottom panel). Atg4 proteolytically processes the Atg8 C terminus.

Atg8 homologues that have been tagged at the C terminus with the myc epitope.191 As an alternative, the ability of Atg4 to delipidate LC3-II can be monitored via the resulting change in mobility during SDS-PAGE.191 Atg8/LC3 lipidation. A two-step process catalyzed by the E1-like enzyme, Atg7, and the E2-like enzyme, Atg3 is involved in the PE conjugation required for attachment of Atg8/LC3 to the phagophore membrane. Western blotting without and with subcellular fractionation can be used to follow Atg8/LC3 conjugation. The attachment of PE causes a molecular mass shift that can be observed through SDS-PAGE (Fig. 19). Unexpectedly, the lipidated form of Atg8/LC3 migrates more rapidly than the nonlipidated species, and resolution of the two forms requires a high percentage gel (12.5–15%) with 6 M urea.144,192 Yeast mutants defective in autophagosome formation or in vacuolar degradation, such as pep4D, accumulate higher levels of Atg8–PE. In contrast, some mutants display low levels of the lipidated protein even in a pep4D background because this species is unstable.144 Atg8 is a hydrophilic protein and localizes to the supernatant fraction prior to conjugation. Attachment of PE causes Atg8 to become membrane-associated, which is easily followed by cell lysis and separation of membrane and soluble fractions.192 In mammalian cells, conversion of the unlipidated and soluble form, LC3-I, to a lipidated species, LC3-II, is a widely used autophagy assay.78 One problem with this analysis, however, is that the level of detectable LC3-I, as well as the overall increase in LC3, is highly cell line- and tissue-dependent.146 For example, in HEK293 cells maintained in nutrient-rich conditions, the primary form of the protein is LC3-I, whereas in HeLa cells it is LC3-II. Thus, it would be possible to monitor the conversion to LC3-II in the former but not the latter (Fig. 13). In addition, simply monitoring LC3-II levels does not provide an unequivocal assessment of autophagy as discussed above. Furthermore, LC3-II may be more easily detected than LC3-I in western blots.81 One final complication is that lipidated Atg8/LC3 is unstable in the absence of the Atg12–Atg5 conjugate,81 so that reduced levels of the lipidated species may reflect a defect in the other conjugation system. www.landesbioscience.com

Autophagic organelle fusion. Subsequent to formation (closure) of the autophagosome, which can be monitored by the various sequestration assays discussed above, the autophagosome can fuse with an endosome to form an amphisome,94 which subsequently fuses with a lysosome to have its contents degraded; or, the autophagosome may fuse directly with a lysosome (Fig. 1).193 Very little work has been done to study these various fusion steps, in particular because it has not yet been possible to reconstitute them under cell-free conditions. It is, however, possible to address them indirectly by the use of suitable inhibitors. For example, because amphisome-lysosome fusion is partially blocked by asparagine,94 preincubation of hepatocytes with asparagine will cause an accumulation of electroinjected [14C]lactose in amphisomes. Upon subsequent incubation in the absence of this reversible inhibitor, the sugar will be transferred to lysosomes, allowing the amphisome-lysosome fusion step to be assayed.30 By preloading autophagosomes with radioactive sugar, for example, in the presence of vinblastine, it may be possible to monitor autophagosome-endosome fusion94 or autophagosome-lysosome-fusion.57 Similarly, sugar preloading of the endosomes can be used to study, for example, endosome-lysosome fusion.194 The intralysosomal degradation step. The organelle preloading technique discussed above can also be used to study the intralysosomal degradation step directly, independently of preceding autophagic steps. Lysosomes can be loaded, for example, with [14C]lactose, in the presence of a reversible acidotropic agent such as propylamine that will prevent acid hydrolysis; upon subsequent drug withdrawal (preferably in the presence of inhibitors to block further autophagic influx), the intralysosomal lactose will be degraded by the lysosomal b-galactosidase.30 This strategy has been used to study the energy requirement of intralysosomal hydrolysis.28 In principle, any lysosome substrate can be used for this purpose. GFP‑Atg8 cleavage. The use of a C-terminal GFP-Atg8 conjugate to monitor Atg8 processing (Atg4 function) was discussed above. By fusing, instead, GFP to the N terminus of Atg8, the generation of free GFP can be used as a measure of intralysosomal hydrolysis. Upon delivery of such a GFP-Atg8–PE complex to the vacuole, the Atg8–PE moiety is rapidly degraded, whereas the released GFP remains relatively stable.187 Accordingly, the appearance of free GFP can be used to monitor the Cvt pathway or autophagy (Fig. 20).184,185 Because only the inner membrane of autophagosomes or Cvt vesicles enters the vacuole, this assay can be used to specifically monitor the degradation of that membrane, or the efficiency of lysis of autophagic bodies. This method can also be used with GFP-LC3 in at least some mammalian cell lines.195

MiCrOAutOPhAgy
Microautophagy in mammalian cells refers to the formation of lysosomal membrane invaginations, observed in the electron microscope, which are believed to be pinched off and degraded intralysosomally along with their contents of sequestered cytoplasm.39 The process is thought to contribute to the overall autophagic degradation of cytoplasm in intact cells,196,197 and has been claimed to be reconstituted under cell-free conditions,198,199 but its physiological significance or molecular properties have never been well characterized. The invagination and degradation of vacuolar membrane containing cytosol has also been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae, as a process distinct from micropexophagy (see below).200,201 Microautophagy does not appear to directly require Atg proteins, and its exact physiological role is not known; it may play a role in removing the outer autophagosome membrane from the vacuole limiting membrane following fusion. The process can be measured in vitro by the uptake of FITC-dextran, or through the appearance of autophagic tubes (invaginations) detected by fluorescence microscopy of FM 4-64-stained vacuoles. Measuring the activity of protease-resistant luciferase following in vitro sequestration, and monitoring autophagic tube formation by electron microscopy are alternative assays.200,201 Piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus (PMN). PMN is a specific type of autophagy in which portions of the nucleus are invaginated within the yeast vacuole and degraded.202 This process is distinct from macroautophagy and does not appear to rely on Atg proteins, although it does require Vac8. The process can be observed through fluorescence microscopy of Vac8 and Nvj1, as colocalized regions of the nucleus blebbing into FM 4-64-stained vacuoles (or through electron microscopy), and also by monitoring degradation of Nvj1.

It should be noted that whole nuclei can also be subject to autophagic sequestration, but in this case by the macroautophagic pathway.156

the Cvt PAthwAy
The cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway shares many molecular characteristics and Atg proteins with macroautophagy (Fig. 1), but has a number of distinct properties that can be used for specific assay purposes. Ape1 processing and activity. Aminopeptidase I (Ape1) is a resident hydrolase located in the vacuole lumen. It is initially synthesized as a cytosolic precursor (prApe1) containing an N-terminal propeptide segment that keeps the enzyme inactive and also contains a domain that binds the Atg19 receptor.203 Precursor Ape1 is delivered to the vacuole through either macroautophagy or the Cvt pathway, depending upon the nutrient conditions. Upon delivery to the vacuole, the propeptide is enzymatically removed generating the mature, active enzyme. The maturation event can be measured by following a molecular mass shift through SDS-PAGE or enzymatically. The former can be seen through a radioactive pulse/chase analysis, allowing a determination of kinetics (Fig. 21A). Delivery of prApe1 to the vacuole requires the receptor protein Atg19 as well as Atg11.19,204 These proteins allow import of prApe1 to be rapid and efficient—the kinetics of import are essentially identical under vegetative or starvation conditions, having a half-time of 45–60 min for conversion to the mature form.203,205 This means 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

The 5,000 x g pellet fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer, then mixed with equal volumes of lysis buffer, 40 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.4% TX‑100, or proteinase K plus 0.4% TX‑100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by mixing with 20% TCA. Samples were resolved by SDS‑PAGE and examined by immunoblot with serum to Ape1 and Pho8 as indicated. Even in the absence of detergent, the prApe1 in atg18Dcells was digested to its mature form by proteinase K. Sensitivity of the Pho8 cytosolic domain in the absence of detergent reflects efficient spheroplast lysis, whereas protection of the Pho8 propeptide indicates integ‑ rity of the vacuole.

that prApe1 processing can be used to monitor specific autophagy. Certain mutants, such as vac8D, block prApe1 processing only under vegetative conditions.179 When autophagy is induced in the vac8D mutant, prApe1 is delivered to the vacuole with normal kinetics. Thus, the kinetics of processing can be monitored through a western blot analysis under these conditions (Fig. 21B). As indicated above, it is also possible to monitor vacuolar delivery of prApe1 through an enzyme assay.206 Precursor Ape1 localization. In general, it is possible to follow the localization of any of the Atg proteins; however, in most cases these data are not particularly informative because most of these proteins can only be detected diffusely in the cytosol and at the PAS. Precursor Ape1 forms a complex in the cytosol that appears to be independent of any of the Atg proteins.20,185 The localization of this complex at the PAS, however, requires the Atg19 and Atg11 proteins (Fig. 22). Thus, by monitoring the localization of prApe1 by itself or comparing it to another protein such as Atg8, it is possible to obtain information about the steps of cargo recognition and packaging. Protease‑protection. A protease-protection or protease-sensitivity assay can be used to assess the completeness of the autophagosome or Cvt vesicle, and is also used in the measurement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (see below). One such assay that is www.landesbioscience.com

convenient in yeast monitors the marker protein prApe1. Precursor Ape1 is resistant to exogenous protease when it is contained within a completed vesicle. In contrast, the propeptide is sensitive to degradation if prApe1 is accessible. The assay consists of osmotic lysis of spheroplasts under conditions that retain the integrity of subcellular compartments, followed by the addition of protease in the absence and presence of detergent.207 The most important aspect of this assay is the use of an appropriate control. One possibility is to use a mutant such as ypt7D that accumulates prApe1 within completed vesicles as a protease-resistant control;207 most atg mutants can serve as controls for protease-sensitivity. The disadvantage of this approach is that the control is external to the experimental sample. An alternate and preferred control is to use Pho8.208 Precursor Pho8 contains a short cytosolic domain as well as a C-terminal propeptide. The propeptide is removed in the vacuole lumen, but will be retained in the pep4D background. The vacuole is relatively fragile, so conditions that maintain the integrity of the vacuole are likely to also preserve the integrity of an autophagosome or Cvt vesicle. The two terminal domains of prPho8 allow an assessment of spheroplast lysis and vacuole integrity; the cytosolic domain should be completely susceptible to degradation by exogenous protease following efficient spheroplast lysis, whereas the lumenally-oriented propeptide should only be degraded if the vacuole limiting membrane has been compromised such as with the addition of detergent (Fig. 23). Ams1 activity. α-Mannosidase (Ams1) is a resident vacuolar hydrolase that is delivered to this organelle through the Cvt and autophagy pathways.209 Ams1 does not appear to require proteolytic processing to become activated; the protein does not contain a propeptide. As a result, vacuolar delivery can only be followed by enzyme assay210 following vacuole purification,211 or qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy of a chimeric protein.209 In addition, Ams1 is synthesized at substantially lower levels than Ape1, which is the standard marker protein for the Cvt pathway (see Ape1 processing and activity). For these two reasons, it is not a convenient marker for autophagy and the Cvt pathway. Nonetheless, Ams1 import requires the same specificity components as prApe1, including Atg19, and thus serves as another marker of specific autophagy. 199

At present, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has only been detected in mammalian cells; the closest equivalent may be the vacuolar import and degradation (Vid) pathway in yeast.212,213 CMA activity can be measured in confluent cells in culture using pulse/ chase experiments as described above, as the increase in the degradation rates of long-lived proteins after removing the serum from the culture medium.214,215 In most mammalian cells, macroautophagy is activated during the first hours of serum removal, but formation of autophagic vacuoles does not occur after 4–6 h of starvation. After this, CMA activity increases progressively, reaching maximal activation at about 10 h after the removal of serum, and remains at this level for the rest of the starvation period.216,217 CMA-dependent degradation is defined under those conditions as that activated by serum removal, which is sensitive to ammonium chloride (the same as any other form of autophagy), but insensitive to PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors (which block macroautophagy).215 Note that metabolic labeling coupled with the use of various inhibitors is essential for this kind of study, because the redundancy of the proteolytic systems in mammalian cells means that the total levels of CMA-substrate proteins measured by immunoblot do not necessarily reflect changes in their degradation through this pathway. For example, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is one of the established substrates of CMA, and its binding or uptake/degradation have been measured to follow different steps of this process;218,219 however, GAPDH can be degraded by multiple pathways. The most unequivocal method to measure CMA is by directly tracking the translocation of substrate proteins into isolated lysosomes using protease-protection assays similar to those described above.41,213,218 CMA can be reconstituted in vitro using isolated lysosomes, and both substrate binding and translocation can be determined.219,220 To measure binding, lysosomes are incubated with the substrate protein in an isotonic medium supplemented with hsc70, the cytosolic chaperone that targets CMA-susbstrates to lysosomes, and nucleotides. Binding of substrate to the lysosomal membrane can be determined as the amount of substrate pulled down with the lysosomes, because any protein internalized by the lysosomes will be rapidly degraded (the half-life of substrate proteins in the lysosomal lumen is about 5 min). Translocation of substrate proteins can be tracked using lysosomes that have been treated with protease inhibitors. The amount of substrate translocated into the lysosomal lumen can be determined by comparing the level of total substrate (bound plus translocated) to the substrate that is resistant to cleavage by an exogenously added protease (Fig. 24). An indirect method to evaluate CMA activity in those tissues or cells in which lysosomal isolation is not feasible, is to analyze changes in the population of lysosomes responsible for CMA, which is defined as those containing lys-hsc70 (the lysosomal chaperone required for substrate translocation) in their lumen. This population can be detected by immunoelectron microscopy with an antibody directed against hsc70218,219 or by immunofluorescence as the number of vesicles containing hsc70 and LAMP-2A (the lysosomal receptor for CMA; note that only the 2A variant of the LAMP-2 proteins is related to CMA).221 It is important to point out that changes in total cellular levels of CMA-related components, namely the lysosomal receptor LAMP-2A and hsc70, do not necessarily correlate with changes in CMA, because both proteins are also present in other cellular compartments and play other roles in the cell. It is thus necessary to determine that the increase or decrease in these components takes place in the lysosome-associated fraction.222 200

Figure 24. Protease protection assay for monitoring chaperone‑mediated autophagy (CMA). (A) Binding and translocation of CMA‑substrate proteins into lysosomes can be reproduced in an in vitro system using isolated lysosomes supplemented with the corresponding chaperones and an energy‑regenerating system. In the absence of protease inhibitors the substrate translocated into the lysosomal lumen is rapidly degraded and only those proteins bound to the lysosomal membrane can be detected when lysosomes are recovered by centrifugation (binding). When the lysosomal proteolytic activity is inhibited, the lysosomes contain both the substrate bound to the lysosomal membrane and the substrate that has translo‑ cated inside the lysosomal lumen (association). The amount of translocated substrate can be identified as those proteins that are resistant to treatment with exogenous proteases (Prot. K), which will degrade only the substrate that is not protected by the lysosomal membrane (uptake).

Fox3 degradation. 3-oxoacyl-coenzyme A thiolase, or Fox3, is a marker enzyme of the peroxisome matrix. When yeast such as S. cerevisiae are grown on glucose, peroxisome number and Fox3 levels are quite low. If the cells are shifted to oleic acid as the sole carbon source (or if methylotrophic yeasts such as Pichia pastoris or Hansenula polymorpha are shifted to methanol), peroxisomes proliferate and Fox3 levels increase. When peroxisome-induced cultures are subsequently shifted back to glucose or to starvation conditions, the peroxisomes are rapidly and specifically degraded by pexophagy, a type of specific autophagy.223 Following the loss of Fox3 by western blotting can be used to monitor the breakdown process (Fig. 25). Transcription of the FOX3 gene is controlled by an oleate response element resulting in a greater than 10-fold decrease in expression in the presence of glucose.224 Accordingly, the loss of Fox3 can be followed kinetically by western blot as there is very little new synthesis occurring under 2007; Vol. 3 Issue 3

Figure 25. Fox 3 degradation assay for monitoring pexophagy in S. cerevisiae. Cells from wild type, atg9D and atg23D strains in the BY4742 background were grown under peroxisome‑inducing conditions (oleic acid) and shifted to SD‑N for 24 h. At the indicated times, protein extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti‑Fox3 antiserum. The atg23D mutant is not defective in pexophagy. This figure was modified from data previously published in reference 155, Tucker KA, Reggiori F, Dunn WA Jr, Klionsky DJ.

Figure 27. The Pex14‑GFP processing assay to monitor pexophagy. The Pex14‑GFP and Pex14‑GFP atg1D strains were grown in medium contain‑ ing oleic acid, then shifted to SD‑N for 6 h. Protein extracts were prepared from cells before and after nitrogen starvation, resolved by SDS‑PAGE and, after western blot, membranes were probed with anti‑GFP monoclonal anti‑ body (Covance, Princeton, NJ). The positions of the full‑length Pex14‑GFP fusion protein and free GFP are indicated. The atg1D mutant is defective in pexophagy and does not generate free GFP.

Figure 26. The GFP‑SKL pexophagy assay. Cells from wild type and atg18D strains were grown to mid log phase in SMD and transferred to oleic acid‑containing medium to induce peroxisome proliferation, labeled with FM 4‑64 to stain the vacuole and subsequently transferred to SD‑N to induce degradation of the excess peroxisomes. Cells were examined by scanning confocal microscopy after incubation in SD‑N at the indicated times. A diffuse fluorescence can be seen within the vacuole lumen of the wild type strain at 2.5 h, reflecting lysis of the peroxisomes. This signal dissipates by 5 h, indicating degradation of the GFP‑SKL. Peroxisomes accumulate outside of the vacuole during pexophagy in the atg18Dmutant.

these conditions.225 It should be noted that the degradation of peroxisomes when cells are shifted to a nitrogen starvation medium (SD-N) is rapid and specific, and cannot be accounted for by bulk autophagy; thus, it presumably reflects a specific process.225 Furthermore, there are practical advantages to using SD-N as opposed to glucose to induce pexophagy. The disadvantage of using glucose is that the cells will grow and dilute peroxisomes due to cell division. This must be taken into account when following protein loss by western blot. GFP‑SKL. One of the most convenient microscopy assays to monitor pexophagy is achieved by labeling peroxisomes with a fluorescent protein modified to express the type 1 peroxisomal targeting www.landesbioscience.com

signal of serine-lysine-leucine at the C terminus.208 As noted for the Fox3 assay above, when yeasts are grown in media with oleic acid or methanol as the sole carbon source peroxisomes proliferate. Subsequently shifting to glucose or starvation conditions results in peroxisome degradation (Fig. 26). This assay can be modified by placing the GFP gene under the control of a regulable promoter such as the oleate response element, to prevent further synthesis after shifting to pexophagy conditions. Finally, as noted for Fox3, growth in glucose to induce pexophagy has the disadvantage of causing cell growth and subsequent dilution of peroxisomes; however, this is less of a problem with microscopy assays than it is with western blot. Pex14‑GFP processing. Pex14 is one component of the import machinery that is located in the peroxisomal membrane; Pex14-GFP serves as an alternative marker to Fox3 or GFP-SKL for this organelle.226 During pexophagy, the GFP domain is cleaved from the chimera in the vacuole. Thus, the appearance of free GFP is a measure of pexophagy (Fig. 27), similar to the way in which it is a measure of autophagy in the GFP-Atg8 assay; however, in this case the GFP is a measure of the cargo rather than the autophagosome membrane. The advantage of Pex14-GFP relative to Fox3 or GFP-SKL is that it is easier to measure the appearance of free GFP than it is to accurately follow the loss of Fox3 or GFP-SKL, especially when the level of pexophagy is low. Peroxisomal enzyme inactivation. In addition to the other methods for monitoring pexophagy, there are various assays that rely on the loss of enzyme activity that occurs when peroxisomes are degraded. The most commonly used assay is loss of alcohol oxidase (AOX) activity.227,228 The degradation of this enzyme can also be followed through western blot. Alcohol oxidase is not present in S. cerevisiae, but can be detected in methylotrophic yeasts such as Candida boidinii,229 Pichia methanolica,230 Pichia pastoris231,232 and Hansenula polymorpha.233 Degradation of formate dehydrogenase and/or catalase has also been examined in H. polymorpha, P. pastoris and P. methanolica.230,232,234 The loss of isocitrate lyase in Yarrowia lipoplytica235 and Aspergillus nidulans,236 dihydroxyacetone synthase in H. polymorpha237 and amine oxidase in Y. lipolytica235 is due to pexophagy. Degradation of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase has been followed in rat hepatocytes.238

Autophagy is required for certain developmental programs, and these can be monitored to follow the overall autophagic process.5 For example, yeast atg mutants are defective in sporulation.239 Dictyostelium discoideum autophagy mutants display a range of phenotypes including the inability to form multicellular aggregates, or defects in fruiting body formation.240,241 In Drosophila, autophagy is needed for pupae formation, and in C. elegans for entry into the dauer stage of the life cycle.

always be examined in parallel because the viability of the control strain may be quite variable depending in part on the density of the culture prior to the shift to SD-N.

COnCluSiOn
This review should make it clear that a large number of assays are currently available to monitor various steps and types of autophagy. At the same time, it should be obvious that no single method is perfect or sufficient, and it is better to combine multiple approaches for a rigorous evaluation of autophagic mechanisms. The current assays include microscopy, biochemical approaches and analysis of specific Atg proteins. The majority of these assays can be used in yeast, but many are applicable to higher eukaryotes. The development of additional methods for the latter will enhance our ability to monitor autophagy for potential therapeutic uses. We hope that the information we have provided will be of use to newcomers to the field, and will stimulate additional analyses of the autophagic process.

AutOPhAgy in PlAntS
Autophagy can be monitored in plants or plant cells using some of the different assays described in this review;242 however, there are also several assays that are specific to plants,243,244 which are grouped in this section. Bolting. The transition from a rosette form to one with an elongated stem is accelerated in autophagy-defective plants. Chlorosis and senescence. The rosette leaves of atg mutant plants undergo earlier senescence and display accelerated chlorosis, observed as a more rapid conversion from green to yellow, reflecting the degradation of chloroplasts and the subsequent loss of chlorophyll. One caveat to this assay is that there is no evidence that degradation of the chloroplast occurs through autophagy, which fits with the acceleration in chlorosis in the absence of autophagic activity; the mechanism of chlorosis is not known. Root elongation. Overall slower rates of growth in atg mutant plants can be followed by measuring root elongation. Seed/Silique production. Arabidopsis atg mutants develop fewer inflorescence branches and display reduced production of seeds or seed pods.

Defects in autophagy cause reduced life-span and lead to a loss in viability. Thus, measuring cell or organismal survival is one method for monitoring the overall process of autophagy. One problem with this assay is that a loss of viability may be due to factors other than an autophagy defect. In addition, loss of viability may be considered a phenotype rather than an assay. Nonetheless, measuring the autophagy-dependent loss of viability has been used successfully in C. elegans,245 D. discoideum,241 mammals246 and yeast.128,129 Two general methods have been used to monitor viability in yeast. In the first approach, yeast strains are grown on rich medium (YPD) and then replica plated onto plates lacking nitrogen, but containing the vital dye phloxine B.129 After incubation for approximately 3–4 days, the colonies are examined for a red appearance that indicates uptake of the dye, loss of viability, and a potential defect in autophagy. One caveat with this method is that the plates should be observed daily because wild type strains will take up the dye to some extent, eventually becoming difficult to distinguish from mutants. The second method relies on growth and incubation in liquid media. Strains are grown in rich medium (YPD) in flasks, then shifted to nitrogen starvation medium (SD-N).207 Aliquots of the culture are spread onto YPD plates in triplicate starting immediately after the shift and continuing for several days. Viable colonies are counted after 2–3 days growth on the YPD plates. Strains such as atg1D show essentially complete loss of viability after 2–3 days incubation in SD-N, whereas other mutants display decreasing viability over the course of seven or more days. A wild type strain should 202
