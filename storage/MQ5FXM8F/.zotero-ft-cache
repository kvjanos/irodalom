Description
Far red fluorescent mutant HcRed was generated on the basis of chromo protein hcriCP from sea anemone Heteractis crispa by random and direct mutagenesis (Gurskaya et al., 2001). Tetrameric HcRed protein was then transformed into a dimeric HcRed1 mutant characterized by unique red shifted emission spectra. To improve HcRed1 for protein labeling we gener ated its tandem variant t HcRed. t HcRed comprises two head to tail linked identical HcRed1 molecules. Since HcRed1 is a dimeric protein, its two covalently linked monomers form an intramolecular dimer, which can be used as a non oligomerizing tag to be fused with proteins of interest (Fradkov et al., 2002). t HcRed is a convenient reporter gene for multicolor labeling. Owing to t HcRed is characterized by far red fluorescence spectra, it is a suitable for tetra color labeling as a distinct far red color. In combination with color variants of GFP, t HcRed can be used in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based techniques (Verkhusha and Lukyanov, 2004).

Performance and use
t HcRed can be expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Mammalian cells transiently transfected with t HcRed vector give far red fluorescence without visible aggregation. Fluorescence is clearly detected within 24 48 hrs after transfection. t HcRed demonstrates successful performance in fusions with subcellular localization signals and many cellular proteins including BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), nucleolar protein fibrillarin, beta acin. However, t HcRed molecule is about two times bigger than other fluores cent tags. This may affect some t HcRed tagged fusions.
