Little is known of the genetic architecture of cancer at the subclonal and single-cell level or in the cells responsible for cancer clone maintenance and propagation. Here we have examined this issue in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which the ETV6–RUNX1 gene fusion is an early or initiating genetic lesion followed by a modest number of recurrent or ‘driver’ copy number alterations. By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukaemia propagating cells, assayed by serial transplantation in NOD/SCID IL2Rcnull mice, are also genetically variegated, mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in competitive regenerative capacity in vivo. These data have implications for cancer genomics and for the targeted therapy of cancer.

Recent genome-wide scrutiny of cancer cells has revealed extraordinary complexity, with substantial numbers of both potential ‘driver’ and neutral or ‘passenger’ mutations per case1,2. Informative though these screens are, they probably reflect predominant or composite genetic landscapes that obscure the existence of subclonal heterogeneity of disease3. Intraclonal genetic diversity is a common feature of cancer4 and is probably, from a Darwinian, natural selection perspective, the essential substrate for clonal evolution, disease progression, relapse or metastasis. Subclonal genetic complexity might also be an important consideration for therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, if a subset of ‘stem-like’ cancer cells, or, as we refer to, propagating cells, are the basis of sustained clonal expansion and disease progression5 then, in principle, they should be genetically diverse if selection and passage through evolutionary bottlenecks is to occur. Identifying intraclonal genetic architecture requires genetic scrutiny of single cells or clonal foci, and there are limited examples of this so far6; nevertheless, they testify to the existence of significant heterogeneity. The genetic diversity of cancer propagating cells is, as yet, unexplored. We elected to address this issue in lymphoblastic leukaemia. The substantial advantage of this cancer, in addition to its amenability to single-cell analysis, is that it is minimally deranged or unstable, genetically, and the broad, temporal sequence of genetic events is known. For the B-cell precursor subset of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with ETV6–RUNX1 fusion studied here, the latter genetic lesion is predominantly a prenatal and presumed initiating event7. It is coupled with a modest number (3–6) of recurrent, genomic copy number alterations (CNA)8. These accrue as secondary and, most likely, postnatal lesions9 in genes that, predominantly, regulate the cell cycle or B-cell differentiation8.

Subclonal diversity of genotypes in ALL
We initially selected 60 cases of ETV6–RUNX1-positive ALL and in which ETV6 was also deleted (15–85% of cells) as detected by fluorescence

in situ hybridization (FISH). Of these, 30 were further selected (see Supplementary Table 1) that also had (by FISH) deletion of PAX5 (n 5 15) or CDKN2A (also called p16) (n 5 12) or deletions of both PAX5 and CDKN2A (n 5 3) in at least 10% of cells. All 30 cases were then scrutinized using a multiplexed combination of distinctive fluorochrome-labelled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes. Two-hundred cells with the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion signal (that is, the reference founder mutation present in all leukaemic cells) were evaluated for each case and each individual cell designed an allele status (that is, mono- or bi-allelic deletion) for ETV6 and PAX5 (three colour) or ETV6 and CDKN2A (three colour) or ETV6, PAX5 and CDKN2A (four colour). The use of an ETV6–RUNX1 probe also allowed us to detect duplication of the fusion gene (in 15 out of 30 cases) or an extra copy of chromosome 21q (via RUNX1 signal copy number; in 21 out of 30 cases). The latter is a common genetic abnormality in ALL and an assumed driver event10. Cutoff levels (%) for scoring genetically distinctive subclones were determined using normal blood controls and varied depending upon probe set combination. A threshold was set at 2% for cells with a single CNA (in addition to ETV6–RUNX1 fusion) and 1% for cells with two or more CNA (see Methods and Supplementary Table 2). Enumeration of CNA in individual cells in reference to ETV6– RUNX1 fusion—the universal marker of all the leukaemic cells— allowed us to identify distinctive genetic signatures of subclones and their relative frequencies. From this we could infer the most likely evolutionary or ancestral relationships between the subclones and derive a clonal architecture. The genetic architectures that were observed were very diverse. The simplest of these genetic architectures that we identified (in 6 cases) involved two or three subclones that could be aligned in a linear sequence (Fig. 1a); however, these were cases with the lowest complement of CNA (only two or three out of the possible total of the seven pre-selected) in addition to the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion.

Inspection of clonal genotypes reveals some previously unrecognized features. It is apparent that the common or highly recurrent CNA are not acquired in any preferential order, indicating that their potency as oncogenic mutations may not be contingent upon (or epistatic to) other CNA. Subclones with the highest number of CNA, positioned ‘terminally’ in the branching architecture, were not necessarily numerically dominant (for example, all three cases illustrated in Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, CNA involving the same gene could be simultaneously present in distinct subclones and must therefore arise more than once, independently. ETV6 was independently deleted two to three times in 14 of the 30 cases (see Fig. 1b, c), PAX5 deleted two or three times in 8 out of 18 cases (see Fig. 1c) and CDKN2A deleted two times in 4 of 15 cases. This raises interesting mechanistic questions and suggests that these lesions are not only selected on the basis of clonal advantage but may be targeted for DNA-level breakage. One possible mechanism is via off-target effects of RAGS or AID11–13.

There is a spectrum of early B-lineage differentiation-linked immunophenotypic signatures in ALL14 and evidence has been presented indicating that cells with several different antibody-defined phenotypes may have leukaemia propagating activity in vivo15. We analysed the genetic heterogeneity of cells flow sorted on the basis of their expression of CD34 (immature lineage marker) or CD20 (more mature B lineage marker). Sorted populations had similarly complex genetic architectures (Supplementary Fig. 3). Cells with the immunophenotype CD341CD382/lowCD191 appear, so far, to be unique to ALL16. We previously found this pro-B/stem population, possibly non-activated or quiescent (CD382), to be significantly enriched in ALL propagating cells when assayed in the NOD/ SCID strain of mice17. When purified by cell sorting, these cells (from patient no. 7) had similar genetic complexity to the bulk leukaemic population (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Clonal architecture in ALL is dynamic
These descriptions of subclonal, genetic profiles in ALL are snapshots taken at a particular time point, that is, at diagnosis. It is likely that subclonal diversity and the relative dominance of subclones varies continuously with the development and progression of disease. ALL rarely has an identified prodromal phase but occasionally (,2%) patients with ALL have an aplastic, pre-leukaemic phase a few months before a diagnosis of leukaemia18. We previously described one such patient with ETV6–RUNX11 ALL19. The diagnostic ALL cells had ETV6–RUNX1 fusion but no ETV6 deletion. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array screening revealed multiple deletions including BTG1 and 11q and gain of chromosome X. We compared the clonal genotypes of cells from this patient at these two time points, spread some 7 months apart, and observed a marked shift in clonal architecture (Fig. 2a). The subclones dominating the aplastic, premalignant phase were relegated to minor, intermediary subclones in the overt leukaemic phase, with dominance of progeny clones that had homozygously deleted CDKN2A. A second patient with a prodromal, aplastic phase some 3 months before a diagnosis of ALL also showed a shift in subclonal dominance (Supplementary Fig. 4). Treatment and subsequent relapse in ALL reorders the spectrum of genetic abnormalities detected by single gene probing20 or SNP arrays21 reflecting the probable selection of distinct subclones as a basis of relapse21. For five of the thirty selected patients (numbers 6, 9, 28, 29 and 30), we had matched diagnosis and relapse cells available for multiplexed FISH analysis. Clonal architecture at relapse was different from that at diagnosis. The comparative genetic profiles of subclones allowed us to identify the most likely subclone giving rise to the relapse, although this attribution was not unambiguous (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Relapse seems to derive from either major or minor clones at diagnosis as previously suggested21 but with a suggestion that more than one subclone might contribute to relapse

or immunophenotypically flow-sorted leukaemic cells into preirradiated NOD/SCID IL2Rcnull mice. Expanded leukaemic populations were re-transplanted into secondary recipient mice as a validation of self-renewal capacity. We compared the genetic signatures of the cell populations that emerged by successful regeneration in vivo, from first and secondary transplants, with those in the original diagnostic sample. Mice with regenerated ALL had significant proportions (3.1 to 93.5 av. 59.4; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) of human haematopoietic (CD451) cells in the marrow and large, pale spleens (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). Effectively, all (.99%) human CD451 cells were leukaemic with the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Genetic analysis was carried out on cells harvested from bone marrow but when assessed, spleen provided the same result (Supplementary Table 4). Leukaemic regeneration in vivo was observed consistently in both unfractionated populations and in fractions defined immunophenotypically as CD341CD382/lowCD191 and CD341CD381CD191 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). This accords with previous evidence15 that propagating cells in B-cell precursor ALL are not restricted to one immunophenotypic compartment. In all 24 mice with primary or secondary leukaemic regeneration, several genetically distinct subclones were present, the patterns of which reflected the diversity of subclones identified in the original diagnostic sample (Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The leukaemic cells regenerated in secondary transplants were compared to pre-transplant primary cells by high-resolution SNP arrays. For patient no. 3, these data confirmed subclonal loss of CDKN2A, subclonal gain of chromosome 21 and loss of one copy of ETV6 in

(for example, patients 6 and 30; Supplementary Fig. 2). The data also indicate that the dominant subclone in relapse itself continues to genetically diversify, in some cases acquiring genetic lesions in the same gene (or chromosome region) as observed in primary, diagnostic subclones. This, along with previous observations on distinctive ETV6 deletions in relapse versus diagnosis20, provides further evidence for reiterative CNA. The patterns of genetic diversity observed in relapse indicate that genetically distinct leukaemic propagating cells can survive chemotherapy and provide a reservoir for relapse and further diversification.

Genetic diversity of propagating cells in ALL
Within the genetic architecture of ALL, it cannot be assumed that all identified subclones are self-sustaining and propagated by cells with extensive self-renewing capacity5. As in evolutionary speciation, it is likely that some branches or subclones are long-lived whereas others are dead ends or out-competed. Nevertheless, the architectural patterns that we observed suggested the possibility that propagating cells for ALL might also have variegated genetics and that this should be demonstrable via serial transplantation in immunodeficient mice. We transplanted, intra-tibially, varying numbers (2 x 103–106) of unfractionated

with an extra chromosome 22 signal were detectable in the initial diagnostic sample in accord with the SNP array data. However, because clone F was dominant in all 9 of 9 mice transplanted with the same cell population (Supplementary Table 4), we assume that a minor subclone of clone F with the extra chromosome 22 was present in the diagnostic sample but at a ,1% frequency. Variable competitive potency of subclonal regeneration was also seen in mice injected with immunologically fractionated cells (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8). These data are indicative of additional genetic complexity of subclones and their propagating cells. Moreover, they indicate that distinctive genotypes are associated, functionally, with variable competitive regeneration in vivo.

The blue lines indicate the mean copy number plot of five contiguous SNPs. Middle line, normal diploid copy number. Two fractions of DNA have been examined using 500K SNP arrays: diagnostic DNA (unsorted cells from patient no. 7 before injection) and DNA from leukaemic cells regenerated in mice (mouse 2, Supplementary Table 4). Deletions of CDKN2A, BTLA and BTG1 are present in both diagnostic and regenerated samples, whereas deletion of ETV6, subclonal gain of the 13q31.3-q34 region and gain of chromosome 22 are distinctive between the two samples.

both diagnostic and regenerated samples (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3). The genetic profiles of regenerated leukaemias revealed variable potency of genetically distinct subclones. For patient no. 3 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3), four subclones read-out in primary and secondary transplants with three being co-dominant. The putative pre-leukaemic clone (with ETV6–RUNX1 fusion only) did not regenerate. With unfractionated cells from patient no. 7 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 4), four of six subclones regenerated upon secondary transplantation. One of these (subclone F in Fig. 4) was dominant despite being a minor (11%) subclone in the initial diagnostic sample. SNP arrays were used to compare the primary diagnostic sample (patient no. 7) versus the regenerated (secondary) transplant leukaemias. These revealed that both leukaemic populations had BTLA and BTG1 deletions (Fig. 4d) in addition to the CNA in CDKN2A, ETV6 and chromosome 21. The regenerated leukaemia had an additional chromosome 22 that appeared to be absent from the initial, diagnostic cell population (Fig. 4d). This was further investigated by FISH using a chromosome-22-specific BAC probe. This confirmed the SNP array data with the majority of cells (with three RUNX1 and one ETV6 signals) in the regenerated leukaemia having an extra chromosome 22 signal (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Cancer development at the cellular level is widely regarded as a Darwinian evolutionary process involving ‘natural selection’ of genetically variant cells in the context of a complex micro-environmental ecology22–24. Mutational and phenotypic diversity between cells is, in principle, fundamental to this process. Moreover, driver mutations can be expected to have maximal selective currency when present in cells with self-renewing functionality. Evidence for intraclonal genetic diversity in cancer has been provided by chromosome karyotype25, by genetic analysis of multi-focal (but monoclonal) cancers26, by FISH-based screening of tissue sections27–29 or immuno-selected cells30, by the molecular probing of multiple small biopsies31 or of micro-dissected tissue32–34 and, recently, by sector-ploidy profiling35. Small numbers of individual circulating tumour cells have also been scrutinized for their divergent genetic profiles36,37. These studies collectively testify that contemporaneous intraclonal genetic heterogeneity is commonplace and, in some cases at least, the degree of clonal diversity is predictive of disease progression31. Most of these data derive from epithelial carcinomas with complex genetic profiles, coupled, in most cases, to genetic instability. In such cases the historical timing and sequence of critical or driver mutational events is effectively buried and clonal architecture could be extremely complex unless clonal dominance occurs. A common assumption for both leukaemias and cancer in general, based on the original evolutionary model of ref. 22, is that progression of disease and predominant genetic profiles reflect sequentially dominant clones and an essentially linear dynamic. Our data (summarized in Supplementary Fig. 1) suggest dynamic patterns of subclonal development and ancestral relationships that are nonlinear with a variable branching architecture. Patterns of genetic diversity in other cancers—assessed by single cell or ploidy sorted cell comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)35,38,39, oncogenically neutral microsatellite markers31,40 or deep-sequenced IGH gene rearrangements41—also indicate nonlinear, branching clonal trajectories. Collectively, these data indicate that cancer has a cellular and genetic architecture reminiscent of Darwin’s iconic evolutionary tree (or bush) diagram depicting speciation42. The extent of genetic variegation in subclones that we detect must be a significant underestimate. We screened for a limited number of pre-selected CNA, which means that other CNA plus any sequencebased driver mutations present will not have been registered. Moreover, antecedent or intermediary subclones, below the 1–2% frequency which we set as a threshold, were identified with more extensive screening in several cases (see Supplementary Fig. 2 patients 2, 5, 15, 18, 20, 6). Identifying the full complexity of subclonal architecture and genetic diversity in ALL (and other cancers) will ultimately require wholegenome analysis at the single cell level. Our data provide the first direct evidence for genetic diversity of cancer propagating cells within individual patients. The consistent patterns of subclonal regeneration in mice (that is, in different mice injected with the same cellular inoculum) suggest variable capacity intrinsically associated with the distinct genotypes of propagating

cells. The competitive potency of particular subclones observed, however, may to some extent reflect selective pressures exerted by regenerative stress in a murine tissue environment. Natural clonal selection in patients might produce different outcomes. It will be important to assess if genetic diversity of propagating cells holds true for other types of leukaemia and cancer in general. If it does, then there would be significant implications for both the cancerstem-cell concept itself and for the therapeutic targeting of such cells. The original model of a distinct, hierarchically positioned subpopulation of cancer stem cells5 has proved contentious in both ALL15 and other cancers43–48. It has been suggested that the NOD/SCID in vivo readout for human cancer stem cell may, at least for some cancers, simply register dominant subclones43,48. Or, alternatively, that cancer stem cells exist but evolve over time44,45. We have previously documented that ‘pre-leukaemic’ and overt leukaemia propagating cells in ETV6–RUNX1-positive ALL, although clonally related by descent, are distinctive in IgH rearrangements and phenotype17. Our current data fit best with what we refer to as a ‘back to Darwin’ model for cancer propagating cells and resultant clonal architecture46. In this, cells with self-renewing properties have variegated genotypes providing the units of selection in the evolutionary diversification and progression of disease. Both sequential and concurrent genotypic variation in propagating cells occur in ALL and, we predict, are likely to do so in other cancers, providing a rich substrate for progression of disease. Although it has yet to be evaluated, it is likely that genetic diversity of cancer propagating cells will be associated with both frequency variation and diversity of functional properties, for example, differentiation status, niche occupancy, quiescence and drug or irradiation sensitivity. This may help to explain some of the inconsistencies and controversies in the cancer-stem-cell field44, 47,48,49. Genetic diversity in cancer varies in extent with stage of disease28,33, probably reflecting the impact of intraclonal competition and ecological bottlenecks. Single cells might negotiate very stringent bottlenecks but the genetic profiles that we observed in relapsed ALL and as recorded in, for example, prostate cancer metastases37,50 indicate continued diversification of propagating cells and dominant or therapy-resistant subclones. This perspective contrasts with the unidimensional or flat (albeit very complex) genetic landscapes of cancer implied in portraits derived from whole-genome scans. This architectural distinction may be of some clinical consequence. Targeted therapy, if directed at mutant molecules, may have limited efficacy if the targets themselves are not initiating lesions but secondary mutations segregated in subclones, even when the latter appear dominant. Genetic variegation of cancer propagating cells may represent a significant roadblock to effective therapy.

METHODS SUMMARY
Archival methanol:acetic-acid-fixed cytogenetic pellets from patients with ETV6– RUNX1 fusion-gene-positive ALL were obtained from several UK hospitals, with local ethical review committee approval (CCR 2285, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). The clinical and cytogenetic data on these patients are given in Supplementary Table 1. Interphase FISH was performed as previously described9,19. In each case, at least 200 nuclei were scored for the presence of the ETV6– RUNX1 fusion gene in combination with hemizygous or homozygous deletion of ETV6, RUNX1, PAX5, CDKN2A and BTG1 and 11q, as well as gain of RUNX1 and duplication of the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion gene. Controls included the scoring of residual normal cells within the diagnostic sample and scoring leukaemic cells with probes hybridizing to irrelevant oncogenes (BCR, ABL) (see main Methods and Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). NOD/SCID IL2Rcnull mice that lack any B, T and natural killer cell activity were bred and maintained under sterile conditions in accordance with Home Office regulations. Transplantation of cells was by intra-tibial injections in 7–14-weekold mice after 250 cGy irradiation. Peripheral engraftment was assessed at 9–10 weeks after transplantation and if .2% mice were killed. Further analysis included the assessment of bone marrow/spleen engraftment, FISH analysis, histological analysis and serial transplantation. For serial transplantations, recovered bone marrow cells were stained with human CD45 to detect human engraftment.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
METHODS
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Archival methanol:aceticacid-fixed cytogenetic pellets from patients with ETV6–RUNX1 fusion-genepositive ALL were obtained from several UK hospitals, with local ethical review committee approval (CCR 2285, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). Interphase FISH for the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion gene was performed using a commercial LSI TEL-AML1 extra signal (ES) probe (Vysis, Abbott Laboratories Ltd) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. This probe set contains a 350-kb probe for the 59 end of ETV6 (exons 1–4) and a 500-kb probe covering the entire RUNX1 gene. The FISH signal pattern for the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion-gene-positive cells using the Vysis probe is two red (one large, one small RUNX1 signals), one green (ETV6 allele not involved in the translocation), one red/green (yellow) fusion signal corresponding to the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion gene. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or fosmid probes for the PAX5, CDKN2A, BTG1, TBL1XR1 genes, 11q and other regions of interest were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Centre, Children’s Hospital, Oakland Research Institute (http://bacpac.chori.org). These were labelled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP or digoxigenin-11dUTP (Roche) and hybridized in combination with the ETV6–RUNX1 ES probe. FISH was performed by standard protocols9,19 and labelled probes detected with streptavidin-Cy5 (bioytinylated probes) and (1) monoclonal anti-digoxigenin (Sigma), (2) horse anti-mouse IgG-Texas red (Vector Laboratories) and (3) goat anti-horse IgG-Texas Red (Jackson Immunochemicals) (for digoxigenin-labelled probes). Fluorescent signals were viewed using an Olympus AX2 fluorescence microscope equipped with narrow bandpass filters for DAPI, FITC, Spectrum orange, Texas red and Cy5. Images were captured and analysed using a chargecoupled device (Photometrics) and SmartCapture 3 software version 3.0.4 (Digital Scientific). Establishing cutoff levels. In each case, at least 200 nuclei were scored for the presence of the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion gene in combination with hemizygous or homozygous deletion of ETV6, RUNX1, PAX5, CDKN2A and BTG1 and 11q, as well as gain of RUNX1 and the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion gene. Diagnostic slides from 26 cases were assessed for hybridization efficiency by scoring the residual normal (ETV6–RUNX1 fusion negative) cells on the same slide (see Supplementary Fig. 9). The percentage of these cells with loss of a single CDKN2A or PAX5 signal was 0–3% (mean 5 1%). As a further control, we hybridized a subset (n 5 11) of ETV6–RUNX1 fusion-gene-positive cases with uninvolved oncogene probes BCR and ABL (see Supplementary Fig. 10). The percentage of cells with the expected normal signal pattern (two red, two green) was 96–99% (mean 5 98%). Cutoff levels for each probe were established by three-colour FISH (test probe in combination with the ETV6–RUNX1 ES probe) using three normal control peripheral blood slides per probe. As ETV6 and RUNX1 were scored on each slide, the values for these two probes were based on 12 slides in total. We used a cutoff 5 mean 1 23 standard deviation. Cutoff levels for each probe (in combination with the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion) were established using 3–12 normal control peripheral blood slides. The cutoff levels for three-colour FISH experiments are given in Supplementary Table 2. Cutoff levels for four-colour FISH were the same as above, except for Texas red probes. The cutoff for loss of one signal using a fourth probe detected with Texas red was 6.9%, because of spectral overlap between Texas red (used to detect digoxigenin-labelled probes) and Spectrum orange (used to label RUNX1 in the commercial ETV6–RUNX1 ES probe). However, in most cases we used three-colour FISH as a cross-check to infer whether clones below this cutoff were real (Supplementary Fig. 2). Only fusiongene-positive cells that also showed the small extra red signal (generated by disruption of RUNX1) were used to calculate the relative frequencies of the various subclones. Genome mapping analysis. Mapping analysis was performed using 500 ng of tumour DNA. DNA was prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions using the GeneChip mapping 500K assay protocol for hybridization to GeneChip Mapping 250K Nsp and Sty arrays (Affymetrix). Briefly, genomic DNA was digested in parallel with restriction endonucleases NspI and StyI, ligated to an adaptor, and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with adaptor-specific primers. The PCR products were digested with DNaseI and labelled with a biotinylated nucleotide analogue. The labelled DNA fragments were hybridized to the microarray, stained by streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugates, and washed using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 then scanned with a GeneChip scanner 3000 7G. Copy number and LOH analysis. SNP genotypes were obtained using Affymetrix GCOS software (version 1.4) to obtain raw feature intensity and Affymetrix GTYPE software (version 4.0) using the BRLMM algorithm to derive SNP genotypes. The samples were analysed using CNAG 3.0 (http://plaza.umin.ac.jp/ genome), comparing tumour sample with unpaired control DNA to determine copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) caused by imbalance51. The position of regions of LOH were identified using the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser, May 2004 Assembly (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ cgi-bin/hgGateway). Combined fluorescence immunophenotype and FISH. Bone marrow and spleen cells from leukaemic mice were cytospun and used for combined or triple-colour immunophenotype/FISH analysis as previously described52. Briefly, cells were air dried and fixed in acetone before incubating in primary biotinylated mouse anti-human CD45 (Clone F10-89-4) and detecting with Avidin-AMCA (Vector Laboratories). After antibody staining, the slides were hybridized with the Vysis ETV6–RUNX1 ES fusion gene FISH probe as described above. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope fitted with a dual bandpass FITC and rhodamine filter, as well as individual DAPI (for AMCA immunophenotype), FITC, rhodamine and Cy5. Images were captured using a charge-coupled device (Photometrics) and fluorescence signals merged and analysed using SmartCapture X software version 2.6.2 (Digital Scientific). Cell separation, phenotyping and sorting. Total mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and directly cryopreserved in DMSO for later use. After thawing dead cells were evaluated and excluded by FACS after staining with Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen). For sorting CD34 and CD20 positive and negative subsets, samples were stained with either mouse anti-human CD34 (IgG1, Dako) or CD20 (IgG1, Southern Biotech) followed by anti-mouse IgG labelled with Pacific blue (Invitrogen). Nonspecific binding of antibody was assessed using mouse IgG1 isotype control stained samples (Dako). Sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria with analysis by Becton Dickinson FACSDiVa software. Samples were gated on forward- and side-scatter plots for mononuclear cells and further gated in forward-scatter height versus area to exclude clumped cells. Before xeno-transplantation, some cells were stained with anti-CD19 PE (BD Pharmingen), CD34 FITC (BD Pharmingen) and CD38 APC (BDPharmingen). CD341382/lowCD191 and pro-B CD341CD381CD191 cells were purified by flow cytometry (in this case, using MoFlo, Dako). Data acquisition and analysis were done with Summit (Dako) software. For multi-colour cell sorting ‘fluorescence minus one’ controls were used to determine positive and negative staining boundaries53. Human cells regenerating in mice were identified by staining with anti-CD45 PeCy7 (BD Pharmingen). NOD/SCID mouse transplantation. NOD/SCID IL2Rcnull mice that lack any B, T and natural killer cell activity were bred and maintained at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine animal facility in accordance with Home Office regulations. Animals were handled under sterile conditions. Transplantations of 2 3 103–106 cells were performed by intra-tibial injections in 7–14-week-old mice. Recipients received 250 cGy of total body irradiation before cell injection. Peripheral engraftment was assessed at 9–10 weeks after transplantation and if peripheral engraftment was .2% mice were killed. Further analysis included the assessment of bone marrow/spleen engraftment, FISH analysis, histological analysis and serial transplantation. For serial transplantations recovered bone marrow cells were stained with human CD45 to detect human engraftment. An equivalent of 2 3 103 to 2 3 105 human cells was transplanted by intra-tibial injections. ¨ May–Grunwald Giemsa staining. The histological analysis of patient samples and mouse bone marrow was performed by May–Grunwald Giemsa staining of ¨ bone marrow smears, bone marrow cytospin preparations and spleen swabs. Slides were analysed on an Olympus BX60 microscope.
