Abstract
Many parameters reﬂecting mitochondrial function and metabolic status of the cell, including the mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, ATP, NADH, ion gradients, and ion ﬂuxes (Ca2+ , H+ ), are amenable for analysis by live cell imaging and are widely used in many labs. However, one key metabolite – cellular oxygen – is currently not analyzed routinely. Here we present several imaging techniques that use the phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive probes loaded intracellularly and which allow real-time monitoring of O2 in live respiring cells and metabolic responses to cell stimulation. The techniques include conventional wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy to monitor relative changes in cell respiration, microsecond FLIM format which provides quantitative readout of O2 concentration within/near the cells, and live cell array devices for the monitoring of metabolic responses of individual suspension cells. Step by step procedures of typical experiments for each of these applications and troubleshooting guide are given. Key words: Cell metabolism, mitochondrial function, cellular oxygen, phosphorescent oxygensensitive probe, phosphorescence quenching, live cell imaging, microsecond FLIM.

1. Introduction
Molecular oxygen (O2 ) is the key substrate of aerobic organisms and the terminal acceptor of the electron transport chain, which can serve as an informative marker of cell metabolism and mitochondrial function (1–6). The development of a number of ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence based O2 -sensitive probes and assays (7–10) has provided relatively simple, non-chemical and

non-invasive means to measure O2 in samples containing respiring cells. Based on the collisional (i.e., non-chemical) quenching by O2 of certain photoluminescent structures (8), these probes combine good selectivity and reliable work across the whole physiological range of O2 (0–250 M) and particularly at low O2 concentrations. They allow contact-less “sensing” of O2 in complex biological samples and particularly in samples containing respiring mammalian cells. Using extracellular O2 -sensitive probes, optical O2 sensing and respirometry were initially applied to the imaging of tissue oxygenation (9) and analysis of bulk consumption of O2 by populations of cells. A panel of high-throughput O2 consumption assays performed in standard microtiter plates with detection on a ﬂuorescent plate reader have been developed and successfully used in a number of useful applications (10, 11–15). More recently, O2 probes suitable for intracellular use have been developed (16, 17–22), which enable the analysis of localized O2 gradients within the cells and a number of additional measurement tasks. In particular, real-time monitoring of fast, transient respiratory responses of individual cells and cell populations (16, 20, 23, 24), which thus far was outside the scope of traditional O2 -sensing probes and techniques, has been achieved. Some of these probes are compatible for ﬂuorescence microscopy imaging. It has been shown that using these intracellular O2 probes and relatively simple cell-handling procedures, sensing of intracellular O2 , and real-time monitoring of metabolic and respiratory responses of live mammalian cells and tissue can be performed (15, 21, 23). Several different cell types, particularly PC12, HepG2, HCT116, HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and A549 cells were examined so far by O2 imaging, which has been shown to provide information-rich data about cell metabolism and good spatial and temporal resolution (16, 22). Application of the O2 imaging approach to suspension cells has been limited due to cell mobility and difﬁculties with sample manipulation and effector addition. These limitations have been overcome by the use of Live Cell ArrayTM (LCA) – a convenient platform developed for imaging of suspension cells (24). LCA provides capturing of cells within an array of specially designed microwells, whereby each well retains a single cell while maintaining cell viability. LCAs facilitate high content image analysis of large number of individual suspension cells with effector treatments. In this chapter we describe the use of intracellular O2 -sensing probes based on phosphorescent platinum(II)-porphyrin dyes, in conjunction with ﬂuorescence imaging for the assessment of mitochondrial function and real-time monitoring of responses of mammalian cells to metabolic effectors. These probes have been developed in our lab and commercialized by Luxcel Biosciences (Cork, Ireland). Standard wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence intensity

3. Methods
3.1. Culturing and Preparing the Cells for Imaging Experiments

1. All cell culture work is performed under a biological safety cabinet. HCT116 cells are cultured as adherent cells; PC12 cells are initially cultured in suspension and then adhered on pre-coated surfaces and differentiated (see Notes 1 and 2). Jurkat cells are cultured in suspension. 2. HCT116 cells are cultured in 75 cm2 cell culture ﬂasks with 0.2 m vent cap in McCoys 5A medium containing 2 mM L -glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin (P/S), 10% FBS, maintaining them in CO2 incubator at 37◦ C and 5% CO2 . Cells are grown to a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/mL, regularly split, and reseeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/mL in 10 mL of medium. Cells are harvested from the ﬂask using trypsin/EDTA, counted on a haemocytometer, and plated on imaging dishes by dispensing 0.2 mL of cell suspension (6 × 104 cells/mL) in the medium. Cells are then grown in minidishes to a conﬂuence of approximately 90% (see Note 7) changing growth medium every 2 days. 3. PC12 cells are cultured in 75-cm2 ﬂasks in RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% horse serum (HS), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), P/S at 5% CO2 with regular passages in 30 mL at 0.5–1 × 105 cells/mL. For seeding, cells are harvested, centrifuged at 200g for 5 min, separated from the supernatant, washed in PBS, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 1 mL of trypsin/EDTA solution. Cells are then incubated for 90 s at 37◦ C, diluted with 10 mL of RPMI supplemented with 1% HS, and gently passed ten times through 23G needle to separate individual cells. The cells are counted and seeded in MatTek dishes pre-coated with a mixture of collagen IV (0.007%) and polyD -lysine (0.003%) at 2.5 × 104 cells/dish. When the cells reach the conﬂuence of ∼50%, they are differentiated for 3–5 days in RPMI supplemented with 1% horse serum, P/S, and 100 ng/mL NGF. After differentiation cell layer becomes conﬂuent and cells remain active for 2–4 days (see Notes 7 and 8). 4. Jurkat cells are cultured in 75-cm2 ﬂasks in RPMI containing 10% FBS, P/S to a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/mL at 37◦ C and 5% CO2 . Cells are split regularly and reseeded at 1.50 × 105 cells/mL in 20 mL of medium (see Note 8). Cells are then harvested from the ﬂask, counted on a hemocytometer, centrifuged at 200g, resuspended in medium, adjusted to a concentration 1 × 106 cells/mL, and kept at 37◦ C.

3.2. Imaging of Adherent HCT116 Cells Loaded with MitoXpress Probe

1. Reconstitute a 1× package of MitoXpress probe (dry sample in a plastic vial) in 0.1 mL of growth medium with additives used to culture HCT116 cells, to produce a 10- M probe stock (see Note 9). 2. Pipette the required amount of medium (0.2 mL per dish) to a glass or plastic vial, add stock solutions of probe (100 L/mL) and Endoporter (6 L/mL), and incubate the resulting probe loading solution for 10–15 min at 37◦ C. 3. Take the dishes with HCT116 cells prepared for imaging experiments as described in Section 3.1, step 2, and transfer 200 L of probe loading solution to each dish. 4. Incubate the dishes in CO2 incubator at 37◦ C for 24–30 h (see Note 10). 5. After the incubation, carefully aspirate probe loading solution from the dish and discard it. Add 1 mL of fresh medium, incubate for 5 min, then aspirate and discard. Repeat washing of the cells two more times and ﬁnally add 0.2 mL of medium (see Note 11). 6. Switch on the microscope and cell incubation system and allow them to warm up and equilibrate (T, CO2 , O2 ) for at least 30 min. Set up the software for image acquisition and time-lapse experiments and the required ﬁlter combination (395 nm excitation and >650 nm emission). 7. Take clean glass cylinder and apply a thin, uniform layer of vacuum grease to one of its edges. 8. Take the imaging dish with cells (prepared in Section 3.1), aspirate medium, and then ﬁrmly attach the cylinder with its greased side to the glass bottom of the dish where the cells are grown (see Note 12). Add 180 L of medium to the cap and 1 mL of medium to the outer space and place the measurement unit inside the heating insert. The assembled unit with glass cap is shown in Fig. 16.1. 9. Assemble the incubation chamber and allow the dish with the cap and cells to equilibrate for about 20 min (see Note 13). 10. Using a 100- L Hamilton syringe, load the solution of effector into the tubing and pump it inside the chamber to allow temperature and gas equilibration. 11. Switch the microscope in transmission mode; focus on cells inside the cap area. 12. Switch the microscope to ﬂuorescence mode. Select ROI where the cells have relatively uniform density and good loading with probe. Representative bright ﬁeld and

(b) Incubation chamber of the microscope with a sample prepared for O2 measurements: 1 – glass cylinder; 2 – imaging dish; 3 – syringe needle connected to the pump for application of effector solution; 4 – heating insert with sample holder of the incubation system; 5 – microscope objective. Measurement requires restricted surface area to reduce convection and mass exchange within the sample, which is provided by a cylindrical cap attached to the bottom of the dish with cells. Effector addition should not disturb the sample. Small volume of effector stock solution is applied on top of the medium by means of perfusion pump with bended needle or gently applied onto the wall of the cap with a micropipette.

ﬂuorescent images of HCT116 cells loaded with probe are shown in Fig. 16.2a, b. 13. Initiate image acquisition in time-lapse mode and monitor basal ﬂuorescent signal of the cells under resting conditions. 14. If the signals are sufﬁciently high (compared to blanks outside the cells) and stable, proceed to the experiments with effector treatments (see Note 14). Initially, it is recommended to test cellular response by treating the cells with uncoupler FCCP and/or with mitochondrial inhibitor Antimycin A (see Note 15). 15. Move the microscope stage to a new ﬁeld with cells within the dish, adjust the focus, and initiate image acquisition in time-lapse mode. 16. After recording the basal signal of resting cells for 5–15 min, make the addition of FCCP between two measurements. We normally add 1/10 of the total sample volume in the cap (i.e., 20 L–180 L) using the lowest possible ﬂow rate of the pump (see Note 16). Continue image acquisition for 10–30 min after the addition of FCCP. When the response is ﬁnished, stop the acquisition and analyze signal proﬁle(s). 17. Interpretation of signal proﬁles of the intracellular probe. Basal ﬂuorescent signal prior to effector addition reﬂects O2 concentration within the cell which corresponds to the resting level of respiration. An increase in probe signal after FCCP addition reﬂects increased respiration which

causes a reduction in cellular O2 . Conversely, Antimycin A is expected to inhibit cell respiration and elevate cellular O2 to the levels present in bulk medium (i.e., air-saturated), thus bringing probe signal to a lower level (see Note 17). A characteristic proﬁle obtained with HCT116 cells and FCCP is shown in Fig. 16.2c. 18. If the responses to FCCP and Antimycin A treatments are clearly seen, the samples are prepared properly, and the cells are in good condition, one can proceed to the experiments with stimulants having unknown effects on cell respiration. 19. In this case, take a new dish with cells loaded with probe and follow steps 11–17 above. Make effector addition and

monitor relative changes in intracellular O2 , which reﬂect the changes in cellular respiration. If required, repeat treatment. 20. Quantitative assessment. Plot signal proﬁle for ROI with cells; adjust intensity scale as required. Select ROI outside the cells and plot the proﬁle of blank signal. Subtract blank proﬁle from the cell signal proﬁle to produce the proﬁle of probe ﬂuorescence (see Note 18).
3.3. FLIM Analysis of Responses of Differentiated PC12 Cells Loaded with IC60 Probe

1. Prepare differentiated PC12 cells in imaging dishes as described in Section 3.1, step 3. 2. Take the vial containing IC60 probe, prepare stock solution and then load the cells with this probe using the same procedure as described above in Section 3.2, steps 1–5, for the MitoXpress probe. 3. Prepare samples and imaging system as described in Section 3.2, steps 6–10. 4. Start with a bright ﬁeld image of the sample for prefocusing, using repetition mode with an exposure time of 5 ms. 5. Change to ﬂuorescence mode. Using steady-state mode (continuous excitation) and exposure time of 300– 1000 ms, take one ﬂuorescence image of the sample. Fluorescent signal received by the camera should be in the region of 1000–3000 counts per pixel (see Note 19). Make adjustments of the focus and sensitivity/scale. Repeat the adjustment taking more images if required. 6. Program the software for time-lapse experiments in the FLIM mode. Using ImSpector software, set up the parameters of phosphorescence lifetime measurements: excitation pulse width, camera modulation, gate time, and modulation frequency (ratio of the gate time and repetition time) (see Note 20). General scheme of phosphorescence decay measurement implemented in our system is shown in Fig. 16.3. Typical settings for the IC60 probe are given in Table 16.1. 7. Perform one set of measurements to generate phosphorescence decay curve for the ROI containing loaded cells. Make ﬁnal adjustment of the sensitivity and intensity signals generated by FLIM. Intensity at the ﬁrst delay time, which is a function of the exposure time, excitation pulse length, and x-y binning, should be in the range 1000–3000 counts (see Note 21). Signal intensity can be increased by binning; however, this will decrease image resolution. 8. Move the sample to a new ﬁeld with cells and commence FLIM measurements. Each time measure

phosphorescence decay of the whole image, repeating this every 2–3 min. 9. Between two measurements of the phosphorescence decay make effector additions (refer to Section 3.2, steps 16 and 17 for details) and continue acquisition of decay curves. After the required number of measurements, stop the acquisition. 10. Deﬁne ROIs within the sample which contain cells loaded with probe, and generate phosphorescence decay curves for each ROI and for each time point of kinetic measurement. Extrapolate these decay curves with single-exponential ﬁts

and determine phosphorescence lifetime value for each measurement. 11. Plot lifetime values as a function of time for each of the ROI and analyze the resulting proﬁles. Examples of FLIM images and respiratory response of PC12 cells to the depletion of extracellular Ca2+ are shown in Fig. 16.4. Intensity proﬁles can also be generated from the images (see Fig. 16.4b). If required, phosphorescence lifetime proﬁles produced by FLIM can be converted into O2 concentration scale, using probe calibration which is determined separately (see steps 12–16 below).

12. Take a fresh imaging dish (without glass cap) containing cells pre-loaded with the probe and 1–2 mL of medium and add Antimycin A to the medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 M. This should block cellular respiration and eliminate O2 gradients in the sample. 13. Insert the dish in the incubation chamber with pre-set pO2 (e.g., 3%) and incubate it for about 30 min to achieve temperature and gas equilibrium. 14. Prepare the microscope for FLIM measurements as described above (see steps 4–7 above). When the sample is ready, measure phosphorescence decay curve. Calculate the lifetime as described in step 10 above. 15. Change the incubation system to a new pO2 setting and reequilibrate the sample by incubating it for ∼30 min. Move the sample/microscope stage to a new ﬁeld with cells and perform lifetime measurement again. Repeat this at 3–4 other pO2 settings. 16. Plot the relationship between phosphorescence lifetime of the probe loaded intracellularly and O2 concentration. Adjust it to the desired O2 scale: at 37◦ C and normal

3.4. Imaging in Live Cell Arrays of Suspension Jurkat Cells Loaded with the IC60 Probe

1. Reconstitute 3 × package of IC60 probe (300 nmoles dried in a vial) in 0.3 mL of medium to produce a 10- M probe stock. 2. Take in a plastic vial 200 L of suspension of Jurkat cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) and add 20 L of probe and 1.2 L of Endoporter stock solutions. Incubate at 37◦ C, 5% CO2 for 24 h (see Note 10). 3. After incubation, wash the cells three times by centrifuging them at 200g, removing supernatant, and ﬁnally resuspend the cells in 0.1 mL of medium. Keep this suspension (approximately ∼2 × 106 cells/mL) at 37◦ C, 5% CO2 for further use. 4. Switch on the Olympus IX51 microscope. Take a new LCA device, place it on the stage of the Olympus microscope, and allow to warm up and equilibrate at 37◦ C for about 20 min (see Note 13). 5. Using a P20 pipette load the LCA with 2.5 L of suspension of cells prepared in step 3 above. Incubate for 5 min at 37◦ C and then ﬂush with 15 L of fresh medium. 6. Using transmission mode, focus on the microwells with cells within the LCA. Ensure that the device is loaded properly and the majority of the microwells contain trapped cells (see Note 22). Sample images of the LCA with cells are shown in Fig. 16.5a, b. 7. Switch the microscope to ﬂuorescence mode, adjust the focus and initiate image acquisition in time-lapse mode. Take images every 20–60 s for about 10 min (see Note 14), using excitation at 395 nm and collection of emission with a 600 nm cut-off ﬁlter. Make sure that cell loading with probe is sufﬁcient, adjust the sensitivity and scale as required. 8. After basal respiration (resting cells) is recorded, pause monitoring and apply effector treatment. Take solution of effector in medium (diluted to the required ﬁnal concentration) and apply with a Gilson P20 pipette 15 L of this solution to the loading bay of the LCA. After the effector is loaded in the LCA, resume monitoring for the required period of time (see Note 23). 9. Select several ROIs within the LCA – controls with cells – and analyze measured proﬁles and respiratory responses. If required, use the well without cells as a reference (blank).

4. Notes
1. A range of common cell lines can be used for imaging intracellular O2 ; however, probe loading efﬁciency and metabolic activity may vary greatly for different cell types. Cells having well-developed mitochondrial machinery and

270

Fercher et al.

high rates of O2 consumption (e.g., primary cells) are the preferred choice. 2. Growth medium, additives, and optimal culturing conditions may vary for each particular cell type. 3. Other O2 probes for intracellular use, including those which do not require transfection reagents, are also available or in development. Contact corresponding suppliers (e.g., Luxcel Biosciences, www.luxcel.com) and research labs to get advice on the most suitable probe for your particular imaging system, measurement task, cell type. 4. In our experience, probe transfection with EndoPorter works well with many common cell types. Other loading reagents and procedures may be efﬁcient as well. Generally, probe loading method and procedure need to be optimized for each cell type and medium. 5. Instead of the imaging dishes with cylinders, glass-bottom 96-well imaging microplates, multiwell ﬂexiPERM inserts (Greiner Bio, Germany) can also be used. Devices with larger well size (e.g., 24-well plates) are less preferred. 6. Equivalent live cell ﬂuorescent imaging systems, which are spectrally compatible and sensitive enough with the O2 probes, can also be used. The MitoXpressTM probe is excitable at either 370–395 or 525–545 nm, and emits around 630–700 nm (maximum at 650 nm). The IC60 probe is excitable at 380–400 as well as at 580–600 nm, and it emits in the near infrared range 720–850 nm (maximum at 760 nm). IC60 probe is more photostable; however, its very longwave emission and lower brightness (compared to the MitoXpressTM ) can be problematic for some imaging systems. 7. Relatively high surface density of cells and high respiratory activity are the main requirements of a successful metabolic assay using the intracellular O2 probes. Cells having high density of mitochondria and high levels of respiration/oxidative phosphorylation such as PC12 and HCT116 produce robust responses to stimulation with various metabolic effectors, whereas slowly respiring and highly glycolytic cells would be difﬁcult to analyze by this method. 8. Optimal conditions for culturing depend on particular cell type. Differentiation is important for many cells to display a range of functional characteristics observed in vivo. 9. Probe loading by facilitated endocytosis in the presence of Endoporter reagent does not impose special requirements on the medium used. Other loading reagents and methods may require serum-free conditions.

10. Probe loading with EndoPorter is relatively slow; however, it works well in different media and cell types and produces high ﬂuorescent signals which are easy to measure. 11. Extreme care should be taken not to damage the cell layer and wash the cells off the surface. 12. The cylinder is required to stabilize local oxygen gradients at cell layer by reducing surface area of the medium which in turn reduces convection and mass exchange within the sample. Based on our experience, this set-up produces better quality results. 13. Efﬁcient temperature control of the measurement system and equilibration of the sample are very important. All O2 probes produce ﬂuorescence response to temperature ﬂuctuations. 14. During these preparations, sample exposure to excitation light should be kept to a minimum. Photostability of the MitoXpress probe is moderate, whereas the IC60 probe is more photostable but less bright. 15. Optimal effector concentrations which produce maximal metabolic response depend on the cell type. We normally use 0.5–5 M for FCCP and 10 M for Antimycin A (in the well). 16. Mixing and disturbing the sample during the addition should be avoided as this will affect local O2 gradients at cell monolayer and, hence, the probe signal. 17. Compared to mitochondrial inhibitors, uncouplers and activators of metabolism produce strong and positive optical response which is easier to measure. If basal respiration of cell monolayer is low and unable to create local O2 gradient, metabolic responses may not be detectable, even though they are present. This is determined by the principle of operation of the intracellular O2 assay (10). The lack or the absence of optical response from the sample/cells is a rather common case. This can be due to low respiration rate so that the cells are unable to create measurable local O2 gradients and changes in response to stimulation. Cell damage during sample preparation, phototoxicity, or probe photobleaching during the measurement can also occur. The following can be used to improve assay sensitivity: (i) increase cell conﬂuence (overgrow cells); (ii) increase cell respiration by using glucose-free medium containing 10 mM of galactose and pyruvate (12); (iii) increase the height of medium layer in the cap; (iv) conduct imaging experiments under reduced pO2 (hypoxia chamber set at 10% or 5% pO2 ); (v) optimize cell culture and probe loading conditions.

18. If probe photobleaching is high, measured proﬁles should be corrected for it. The initial part of the proﬁle, which corresponds to basal respiration, can be used to quantify the rate of photobleaching. 19. Try several different settings in steps 4 and 5, and select those which provide lowest photobleaching during image acquisition. 20. For our system, delay time is calculated from the ratio of the effective measurement time (between start and end of one cycle) and the number of measurement points less one point. Cycle time is the time between LED pulses. Gate is integration time of the ﬂuorescence signal for each delay time. 21. To get approximately the same level of signal from the sample in the FLIM mode, exposure time on the camera needs to be increased approximately ﬁve times compared to the steady-state measurement mode. 22. If loading of the LCA with cells is poor, step 8 can be repeated. 23. The time of monitoring of metabolic responses of cells is determined by the mode of action of the effector. It is also limited by the changes in cell viability during the measurement (i.e., phototoxicity). Most of our imaging experiments were conducted over a period of 20–60 min. Since both MitoXpress and IC60 probes do not leak from the cells, longer experiments with reduced sampling frequency are possible.
