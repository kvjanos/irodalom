Getting Started Creating a Custom Search Engine

NOTE: You must have a Google account (free) to create a search engine. • If you use gmail, your gmail username and password are your account. • If you do not use gmail or other Google services, you must fill out their form to create an account. The form is at www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount

Steps to create a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE)
1. 2. 3. 4. Go to www.google.com/coop Click on Custom Search Engine under Create your own search engine In the blue box, click on Create a Search Engine These four fields are the minimum required to activate a CSE: Examples: Name for the search engine Description One or more keywords At least one URL to be searched • Infopeople Training CSE Search for library staff training training libraries "staff development" http://infopeople.org/training/

If you enter an "index.html" URL like the one above, the CSE will search all pages beginning with that index. If I enter http://infopeople.org/ the CSE will search the entire Infopeople public site. If I enter a specific web page, like http://infopeople.org/resources/computers.html, the CSE will only search that page. You can list up to 5,000 URLs in a single CSE. They will all be searched. • You may want to change the scope of the CSE search results. The default is to search only within the URLs you enter. The other options searches all of google.com, with your CSE results first. How to search these sites: Search only these sites Search the entire web but emphasize these sites • Do not change the advertising status unless you are acting on behalf of a non-profit, university, or government website. All others are required to display Google ads as "Sponsored links" on the right side of CSE search results. 5. 6. 7. Agree to the terms and click Next. On the next screen, try your search engine by typing a search in the search box. If it works, click FINISH. You can add and modify later.

Managing Your CSE:
Getting back to your CSE 1. To return to your CSE(s), go to google.com/coop and click on My search engines. 2. Log into your Google account, unless you are already logged on by a cookie. 3. On the next page, you will see a list of your CSE's, each followed by: • homepage: a preview of what your CSE looks like to users • control panel: where most management occurs (see below) • statistics: usage of your CSE • delete: permanently get rid of a CSE

Control Panel • Basic: modify title, description, keywords, and other choices from initial setup. • Sites: type or paste URLs in the box to make them searchable in your CSE. • Refinements: words that reflect aspects of your CSE's topic. These appear above search results and clicking on them causes a search based on keywords you specify. • Look and feel: add a logo, modify colors, etc. in your search page. • Code: HTML code you can copy and paste into any web page to put your CSE search box there. • Collaboration: invite others to participate in building a CSE and check status of their involvement. • Make money: connect with the revenue from people clicking on ads in your CSE. • Advanced: if you are technically adept, additional tools to build and modify your CSE. • Preview: see what you've created. Adding more URLs to your CSE • You can type or paste URLs, one at a time, into the box under Sites in the Control Panel. • The easiest way to add URLs to your CSE is to use the Google Marker. Whenever you have a website in your browser you want your CSE to search, click the Google Marker. • You can drag the Google Marker link to your bookmarks/favorites and drop it. The Google Marker link is in the blue menu on the left of most Google Custom Search Engine pages.

Publicizing your CSE:
• • • • • Its URL is in Google Co-op by default, and it should get crawled by googlebots and be in google.com before long. Send its URL to your friends. Put in your del.icio.us bookmarks and any other sharing space you have, like your blog. Submit it to a CSE directory (see course bookmarks). Paste the code in any web page.

More help:
• • SEE PDF: "Review Guide" Custom Search Engine in your bookmarks for this course. CSE Support, Blog, and Discussion Group at your Google Co-op CSE page, after login.
