AbstrACt
The regulation of cell growth and proliferation is fundamental for animal development and homeostasis but the mechanisms that coordinate cell growth with cell cycle progres‑ sion are poorly understood. One possibility is that “cell‑size checkpoints” act to delay division until cells have achieved a minimal size or mass however, the existence of such checkpoints in mammalian cells is controversial. In this study we provide further evidence against the operation of a size checkpoint in mammalian cells. We show that primary mammalian cells proliferate at a rate that is independent of cell size or cell mass and that cell size is “set” by the balance of extracellular growth factors and mitogens. Moreover, we show that commonly used culture conditions stimulate cell growth much more than cell cycle progression resulting in cells that proliferate at sizes 300–500% larger than their in vivo counterparts. This has profound effects on cell behaviour.

Cell	growth	and	cell	division	appear	to	be	precisely	coordinated	in	proliferating	cells.	 Thus,	 proliferating	 cells	 usually	 double	 their	 mass	 before	 each	 division,	 maintaining	 a	 constant	 mean	 size	 over	 time.	 The	 mechanisms	 coordinating	 these	 processes	 however,	 remain	 poorly	 understood.	 In	 yeast,	 there	 is	 evidence	 suggesting	 that	 growth	 regulates	 cell	division	by	means	of	an	intrinsic	mechanism	that	monitors	the	size	of	the	cell.	This	 internal	sensor,	termed	a	size	checkpoint,	is	thought	to	regulate	cell	size	by	pausing	cell	 cycle	progression	until	cells	reach	a	minimum	or	critical	size.	However,	as	yeast	cells	divide	 at	 different	 sizes,	 depending	 on	 nutrient	 conditions,	 it	 means	 that,	 if	 this	 “critical	 size”	 exists,	it	must	be	adaptable.1‑4 Recent	studies	have	argued	for	and	against	the	existence	of	size‑checkpoints	in	animal	 cells	 and	 it	 remains	 controversial	 as	 to	 whether	 growth	 regulates	 cell	 cycle	 progression	 in	multicellular	organisms.4‑7	In	yeast,	growth	rate	increases	with	the	size	of	the	cell,	so	 that	bigger	cells	grow	faster	than	small	cells,	a	situation	that	would	seem	to	require	a	cell	 size	 checkpoint	 to	 maintain	 a	 constant	 size	 distribution	 of	 the	 population	 over	 time.8	 Counter‑intuitively,	in	mammalian	cells,	growth	rate	seems	not	to	increase	with	cell	size.6	 Theoretically,	 this	 linear	 control	 of	 cellular	 growth	 makes	 an	 internal	 size‑checkpoint	 mechanism	 unnecessary.6,8	 There	 are	 other	 differences	 between	 growth	 control	 in	 yeast	 and	mammalian	cells:	in	animals,	cell	growth	and	cell	proliferation	are	not	solely	deter‑ mined	 by	 nutrient	 availability,	 as	 in	 yeast,	 but	 also	 by	 extracellular	 growth	 factors	 and	 mitogens.3	This	dependence	on	extracellular	factors	has	been	shown	to	be	absolute:	cells	 cultured	in	the	absence	of	mitogens	will	not	proliferate,	and	cells	cultured	in	the	absence	 of	 growth	 factors	 will	 not	 grow	 and	 despite	 being	 bathed	 in	 nutrients,	 will	 undergo	 autophagy	 and	 ultimately	 die.9	 Furthermore,	 growth	 and	 proliferation	 can	 clearly	 be	 	 regulated	 independently	 in	 animal	 cells.	This	 can	 be	 seen	 both	 in	 vitro,	 where	 distinct	 factors	 have	 been	 shown	 to	 be	 able	 to	 regulate	 these	 processes	 separately,10,11	 and	 in	 vivo,	where	growth	can	occur	in	the	absence	of	proliferation	(nerve	and	muscle	cells)	and	 proliferation	can	occur	in	the	absence	of	growth	(blastomeres).12	None	of	this	evidence	is	 conclusive	however,	and	it	remains	uncertain	how	mammalian	cell	size	is	regulated.

see	a	decrease	in	the	proliferation	 rate	 shortly	 after	 the	 shift	 and,	 if	 cell	 mass	 regulates	 proliferation	 rate,	we	might	expect	an	increase	 in	the	proliferation	rate,	as	the	size	 of	the	cells	progressively	increases	 to	 their	 new	 steady‑state	 size.	 However,	 if	 the	 rate	 of	 cell	 cycle	 proliferation	is	independent	of	cell	 size,	 then	 the	 cells	 should	 prolif‑ erate	faster	soon	after	the	shift‑up	 and	 maintain	 a	 constant	 rate	 of	 proliferation	as	the	cell‑size	gradu‑ ally	increases.	To	test	these	models,	 we	 gave	 the	 cells	 short	 pulses	 of	 BrdU	 following	 the	 shift‑up	 and	then	used	immunostaining	to	 determine	 the	 percentage	 of	 cells	 that	 had	 incorporated	 BrdU.	 We	 performed	 these	 experiments	 in	 two	 conditions:	 (i)	 our	 standard	 conditions,	in	which	the	cells	were	 grown	on	laminin	and	the	differ‑ ence	 in	 proliferation	 rate	 is	 small	 and	(ii)	on	fibronectin,	where	the	 difference	in	proliferation	rate	was	 greater.	 In	 both	 cases,	 the	 BrdU	 incorporation	 rate	 increased	 very	 soon	 after	 the	 shift,	 reaching	 a	 maximal	 constant	 level	 within	 24h	(Fig.	2B).	This	rapid	increase	 in	 BrdU	 incorporation	 rate	 was	 mirrored	 by	 a	 rapid	 decrease	 in	 cell‑cycle	time,	as	measured	by	the	 increase	 in	 cell	 number	 following	 the	 shift‑up	 (Fig.	 2C).	 The	 cells	 required	~192	h	to	reach	a	stable	 size	and	protein	content	yet	during	 this	 time	 they	 had	 a	 constant	 proliferative	 rate	 (Fig.	 2B–D).	 These	 findings,	 coupled	 with	 the	 observation	 that	 it	 took	 more	 than	 three	 population	 doublings	 to	 reach	 the	 new	 steady‑state	 size	 (Fig.	 2C),	 demonstrate	 that	 cell	 size	 is	 not	 determining	 prolifer‑ ation	 rate	 and	 that	 these	 cells	 do	 not	 appear	 to	 have	 a	 cell‑size	 checkpoint.

and	 the	 cells	 have	 a	 size	 checkpoint	 we	 should	observe	an	acceleration	of	the	prolif‑ eration	 rate	 shortly	 after	 the	 shift.	 Instead	 however,	 we	 observed	 a	 rapid	 decrease	 in	 the	 percentage	 of	 cells	 that	 incorporated	 BrdU	 to	 a	 lower	 constant	 value	 with	 the	 new	 proliferation	 rate	 dependent	 on	 the	 level	 of	 mitogen	 and	 the	 type	 of	 extracel‑ lular	 matrix	 (Fig.	 2E	 and	 F).	 As	 in	 the	 case	of	the	shift	up,	the	down‑shifted	cells	 required	several	cycles	to	reach	a	stable	size	 distribution	(data	not	shown).	Again,	these	 results	 argue	 that	 the	 level	 of	 extracellular	 mitogens	 determines	 the	 proliferation	 rate	 without	any	input	from	the	size	of	the	cell. Modelling cell size regulation in the absence of a cell size checkpoint.	 Our	 results	 suggest	 that	 changing	 the	 levels	 of	 extracellular	 growth	 factors	 and	 mitogens	 results	 in	 a	 rapid	 switch	 to	 new	 growth	 rates	and	cell	cycle	times.	They	imply	that	 the	rate	of	change	in	cell	size	and	cell	mass	 in	 different	 culture	 conditions	 and	 the	 time	taken	to	reach	a	new	steady‑state	size	 would	 solely	 depend	 on	 the	 differences	 in	 the	growth	and	proliferation	rates.	This	can	 be	modelled	mathematically,	by	calculating	 the	 predicted	 change	 in	 size	 and	 mass	 of	 cells	 following	 a	 shift‑up,	 assuming	 an	 immediate	 change	 to	 a	 new	 linear	 rate	 of	 growth	and	a	new	cell	cycle	time.	Thus,	the	 predicted	size	of	a	single	cell,	one	cycle	after	 the	shift	(S1)	can	be	calculated	according	to	 the	following	expression: S1	=	(S0	+	gt)/2, where	 S0	 is	 the	 size	 of	 the	 cell	 before	 the	 fibroblasts and size (as measured in a Coulter counter) immediately after purification and after six days shift	 (size	 of	 Schwann	 cells	 in	 SF),	 g	 is	 in culture in 10% FCS (144 h).

fibroblasts	divide	at	a	size	that	depends	on	how	fast	they	are	growing	 and	 how	 fast	 they	 are	 going	 through	 the	 cell‑cycle,	 both	 of	 which	 vary	 according	 to	 the	 concentration	 of	 extracellular	 signals.	 In	 this	 model,	 switching	 between	 different	 levels	 of	 extracellular	 factors	 causes	a	rapid	change	to	new	rates	of	proliferation	and	growth,	which	 can	 be	 determined	 independently	 by	 the	 levels	 of	 mitogens	 and	 growth	factors.	The	differences	in	the	growth	rates	and	proliferation	 rates	will	then	determine	the	number	of	divisions	required	to	reach	 the	new	steady‑state	cell	size	distribution.	We	have	determined	these	 theoretical	changes	in	cell	size	and	mass	and	found	that	they	closely	 mirror	 our	 experimental	 values.	 As	 expected,	 the	 model	 is	 able	 to	 accurately	predict	the	number	of	cell	cycles	required	to	reach	the	new	 steady‑state	cell	size. This	 model	 is	 consistent	 with	 in	 vivo	 studies	 in	 Drosophila	 and	 mice	where	findings	that	disruption	of	various	growth	and	cell‑cycle	 regulatory	 pathways	 can	 result	 in	 altered	 cell	 size	 suggested	 that	 growth	and	cell	proliferation	can	be	independently	regulated.3,16‑19	 A	recent	study	however,	has	claimed	to	provide	evidence	for	yeast‑like	 cell‑size	 checkpoints	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 mammalian	 cells.7	 In	 the	 shift	 experiments	 reported	 in	 these	 studies,	 the	 differences	 in	 size	 were	 less	 than	 two‑fold,	 which	 means	 that	 the	 cells	 could,	 in	 principle,	 adjust	 their	 size	 within	 one	 cycle,	 even	 without	 a	 cell‑size	 check‑ point.	 Moreover,	 artificial	 extension	 of	 S	 phase	 by	 aphidicolin	 in	 these	studies	may	have	had	additional	effects	on	the	cell‑cycle.	Other	 possible	 explanations	 for	 the	 differences	 between	 their	 studies	 and	 ours	include	that	a	gradual	change	in	a	size‑checkpoint	occurred	in	 our	experiments	after	the	shift.	We	think	this	is	unlikely	as	it	should	 have	 resulted	 in	 a	 gradual	 change	 in	 proliferation	 rates,	 which	 we	 did	not	see.	Our	results	however,	do	not	preclude	the	possibility	that	 there	is	a	minimum	size	below	which	cells	cannot	enter	the	cell	cycle.	 Indeed,	it	has	been	shown	that	lymphocytes	undergoing	autophagy	 following	IL‑3	removal,	become	very	small	and,	upon	IL‑3	readdi‑ tion,	take	several	days	to	reenter	the	cell‑cycle	following	a	period	of	 growth.9	Whether	this	reflects	the	operation	of	a	cell‑size	checkpoint	 will	require	further	examination. In	cultured	Schwann	cells,	growth	and	cell‑cycle	progression	can	 be	regulated	independently	by	the	extrinsic	factors	IGF1	and	NRG,	 respectively.11	This	has	allowed	growth	and	cell‑cycle	progression	to	 be	studied	separately	in	these	cells.	In	many	other	cells,	the	separa‑ tion	 of	 these	 two	 processes	 may	 be	 less	 clear,	 as	 many	 extracellular	 signals	stimulate	both	growth	and	cycle	progression.	In	many	ways,	 this	coregulation	makes	sense,	in	that	it	provides	a	simple	mechanism	 to	coordinately	drive	proliferation	and	growth	and	would	thus	be	a	 useful	strategy	to	produce	large	numbers	of	similarly	sized	cells.	This	 coordination	 however,	 does	 not	 dictate	 the	 existence	 of	 a	 cell‑size	 checkpoint.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 use	 of	 separate	 extracellular	 signals	to	regulate	these	processes	independently,	allows	an	animal	to	 www.landesbioscience.com	

produce	cells	of	varying	sizes	by	simply	changing	the	concentrations	 of	these	factors. We	have	observed	that	commonly	used	culture	conditions,	using	 FCS,	can	produce	proliferating	cells	that	are	3–5	fold	larger	than	they	 normally	are	in	vivo.	The	reason	they	are	so	big	is	because	factors	in	 FCS	increase	growth	rate	much	more	than	they	increase	the	rate	of	 cell‑cycle	progression.	In	other	words,	FCS	is	a	much	more	potent	 growth	 factor	 than	 it	 is	 a	 mitogen.	 As	 most	 cells	 are	 cultured	 in	 serum,	 it	 is	 likely	 that	 they	 are	 operating	 at	 an	 abnormally	 higher	 growth	rate	than	is	seen	in	vivo	and	are	functioning	at	an	abnormally	 large	size.	This	is	consistent	with	the	large	size	of	fibroblast	cell	lines	 commonly	 studied	 in	 culture	 (Table	 1)	 and	 is	 likely	 to	 be	 the	 case	 for	many	cells	cultured	in	FCS.	We	have	shown	that	the	increase	in	 cell	size	is	associated	with	changes	in	cell	morphology,	but	it	is	likely	 that	 there	 are	 many	 other	 effects	 on	 the	 physiology	 of	 the	 cells,	 as	 the	 differences	 in	 size	 reflect	 changes	 in	 the	 protein	 synthesis	 and	 	 metabolic	rate.	Indeed,	we	consider	it	likely	that	this	drastic	change	 to	 the	 metabolism	 of	 the	 cell	 contributes	 to	 the	 general	 “culture‑ shock”	 phenomenon	 seen	 when	 cells	 are	 removed	 from	 an	 animal	 and	placed	into	culture.
