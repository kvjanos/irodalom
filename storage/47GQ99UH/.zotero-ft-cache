The reduction of intracellular 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) levels stimulates autophagy, whereas the enhancement of IP3 levels inhibits autophagy induced by nutrient depletion. Here, we show that knockdown of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) with small interfering RNAs and pharmacological IP3R blockade is a strong stimulus for the induction of autophagy. The IP3R is known to reside in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as within ER–mitochondrial contact sites, and IP3R blockade triggered the autophagy of both ER and mitochondria, as exactly observed in starvation-induced autophagy. ER stressors such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin also induced autophagy of ER and, to less extent, of mitochondria. Autophagy triggered by starvation or IP3R blockade was inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL speciﬁcally targeted to ER but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL proteins targeted to mitochondria. In contrast, ER stress-induced autophagy was not inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Autophagy promoted by IP3R inhibition could not be attributed to a modulation of steady-state Ca2 þ levels in the ER or in the cytosol, yet involved the obligate contribution of Beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (Atg)5, Atg10, Atg12 and hVps34. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that IP3R exerts a major role in the physiological control of autophagy.

The ﬁrst step of macroautophagy consists in the gradual envelopment of cytoplasmic material (cytosol and/or organelles) in the phagophore, a cistern that ﬁnally sequesters cytoplasmic material in autophagosomes (also called autophagic vacuoles (AVs)) lined by two membranes. Autophagosomes then undergo a progressive maturation by fusion with endosomes and/or lysosomes. This latter step creates autolysosomes in which the inner membrane as well as the luminal content of the AVs is degraded by lysosomal enzymes. The process of autophagy is controlled by a series of evolutionary conserved genes, the atg genes, whose products are essential for speciﬁc steps of the autophagic process.1,2 One of the strongest triggers of autophagy is nutrient stress.3,4 In response to starvation, cells degrade nonessential components thereby generating nutrients for meeting the cell’s energetic demand as well as for vital biosynthetic reactions. In such circumstances, when autophagy is an adaptation, inhibition of autophagy has a negative impact on cell survival. For example, mice lacking the atg5 gene survive without any major developmental defect until birth, yet succumb to the stressful neonatal period unless puppies are force-fed with milk within the ﬁrst hours after birth.5 Similarly,

human cell lines cultured in nutrient-free media mount a cytoprotective autophagic response. Suppression of autophagy by chemical inhibitors or knockdown of essential genes thus sensitize cells to starvation-induced cell death.6,7 Autophagy inhibition also sensitizes cells to the depletion of obligatory growth (or survival) factors resulting in a decrease of nutrient import through the plasma membrane. For example, the knockdown of Atg5, Atg10 or Atg12 (which are all involved in a ubiquitin-like conjugation system required for autophagosome formation) prevents the generation of AV and sensitizes cells to cell death induced by withdrawal of essential growth factors.8 Similarly, knockdown of Atg6/ Beclin-1 (whose major physiological partner is the class III phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase Vps34) inhibits autophagy and sensitizes to cell death induced by starvation.6,8 Beclin-1 also interacts with Bcl-2,9 which inhibits autophagy,10 perhaps by preventing the interaction between Beclin-1 and Vps34.11 One recent study suggested that myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) could regulate autophagy because inhibition of inositol monophosphatase by lithium or L-690,330 stimulates autophagy through the depletion of inositol and IP3.12 IP3 is a second messenger produced primarily in response to the stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptor or receptor tyrosine

kinases. IP3 acts on the IP3 receptor (IP3R), a mostly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-sessile Ca2 þ release channel that integrates signals from numerous small molecules and proteins including nucleotides, kinases and phosphatases, as well as nonenzyme proteins.13 IP3R is known to play a major role within the Ca2 þ microdomains that transmit Ca2 þ spikes generated by the ER to mitochondria.14,15 IP3R is also regulated by Bcl-2 16,17 and Bcl-XL,18 which affect Ca2 þ ﬂuxes through IP3R by direct molecular interactions, by inﬂuencing its regulatory phosphorylation and/or by modulating its response to IP3. Through these regulatory mechanisms, IP3R modulates diverse cellular functions, which include, but are not limited to, contraction/excitation, gene expression, cellular growth and apoptosis.13,19 On the basis of these premises, we decided to investigate the contribution of IP3R to the regulation of autophagy. Here, we report that the depletion of IP3R or its inhibition triggers rapid autophagy affecting both ER and mitochondria. IP3R functions as a Bcl-2-regulated repressor of autophagy.

ER stress-induced autophagy affects ER and mitochondria. ER stress triggered the emergence of bona ﬁde AVs, as deﬁned by cytoplasmic structures lined by two membranes that can be detected by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 2d and e). The LC3-GFP-positive vesicles induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin colocalized with the ER marker calreticulin, but also colocalized in part with the mitochondrial matrix marker HSP60, suggesting that ER stress causes autophagy of both ER and mitochondria (Figure 2f–h). ER stress-induced autophagy followed a classical autophagic pathway to the extent that the knockdown of essential atg genes such as atg6/beclin-1, atg5, atg10, atg12 as well as the knockdown of the mammalian class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase vps34 inhibited autophagy induced by thapsigargin, tunicamycin or brefeldin A (Figure 3). Altogether, these data suggest that ER stress effectively trigger autophagy that follows a canonical pathway. IP3 depletion and IP3R inhibition stimulates autophagy of both ER and mitochondria. The inositol monophosphatase inhibitors L-690,330 and lithium both induced autophagy (Figure 4a and b) under conditions in which neither agent induced toxic effects on the viability or bioenergetic state of cells (Figure 4c). Both L-690,330 and lithium triggered signiﬁcant autophagy of both ER and mitochondria (Figure 4d–f). Very similar results were obtained by inhibition of IP3R. Knockdown of the IP3R I and III isoforms caused a strong, nonsynergistic induction of autophagy, as measured by LC3-GFP relocalization (Figure 5a and b). Similarly, xestospongin B, a chemical antagonist of IP3R,26 caused LC3-GFP aggregation in cytoplasmic vacuoles (Figure 5c). Stimulation of autophagy was more pronounced for xestospongin B than for xestospongin C, which has a lower afﬁnity for IP3R27 (Figure 5d). Moreover, the xestospongin B effect was rapid (p2 h, Figure 5e) and did not involve any major toxicity on mitochondria (Figure 5f) nor on the ER (as estimated by measuring the ER stress indicator GADD34; inset in Figure 5f). Xestospongin Binduced autophagy required atg6/beclin-1, atg5, atg10, atg12 and vps34 (Figure 5g), indicating that it followed an orthodox pathway. Under the conditions in which xestospongin B was employed in this study, the luminal ER Ca2 þ and the baseline cytosolic Ca2 þ concentrations were not modulated (Figure 6a and b), although xestospongin clearly blunted the histamine-induced IP3/IP3R-dependent ER Ca2 þ efﬂux, as an internal control of its efﬁcacy (Figure 6c). Moreover, depletion of extracellular Ca2 þ did not affect the xestospongin B-induced autophagy (Figure 6d), suggesting that the xestospongin B effects were not mediated by gross perturbations of intracellular Ca2 þ ﬂuxes. Ultrastructural analysis of xestospongin B-elicited AV indicated that they frequently contained degenerating mitochondria or ER (Figure 7a). Accordingly, LC3-GFP aggregates elicited by xestospongin B colocalized with either calreticulin or HSP60 (Figure 7b–d). Thus, IP3R blockade caused the same pattern of autophagy as that induced by starvation. ER-targeted Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL differentially inhibit autophagy. IP3R has been shown to interact physically

Results and Discussion Starvation-induced autophagy concerns both ER and mitochondria. Upon 12 h of culture in the absence of serum and nutrients (starvation), HeLa cells manifest the relocalization of LC3-GFP into AVs and this effect is inhibited by addition of the cell-permeable IP3 precursor myo-inositol (Figure 1a and b). Under these conditions, little cell death (as determined with the vital dye propidium iodine (PI)) occurred after serum withdrawal and the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DCm) induced by starvation was inhibited by myo-inositol (Figure 1c). Starvation-induced LC3-GFP aggregates partially colocalized with the ER marker calreticulin and with the mitochondrial matrix marker HSP60, indicating that this regimen caused autophagy of both ER and mitochondria (Figure 1d–f).

ER stress but not mitochondrial stress induce autophagy. As starvation can induce an ER stress response20,21 as well as mitochondrial stress,22 we investigated whether direct induction of organelle-speciﬁc stress would stimulate autophagy. Thapsigargin (which selectively inhibits the Ca2 þ –ATPase responsible for Ca2 þ accumulation by the ER, SERCA), tunicamycin (which blocks N-linked protein glycosylation), brefeldin A (which inhibits ER–golgi transport) are well known for their capacity to induce ER stress21,23 and all of them induce rapid LC3-GFP aggregation in AVs (Figure 2a and b), well before they cause cell death and DCm dissipation (Figure 2c). In contrast, induction of mitochondrial stress by antimycin A (which inhibits complex III of the respiratory chain), betulinic acid (which can cause direct permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes)24 or cadmium (a heavy metal that induces oxidative stress and permeability transition)25 did not stimulate autophagy under conditions in which all three agents caused a signiﬁcant DCm loss (Supplementary Figure S1). These data suggest that ER stress is a stronger inducer of autophagy than mitochondrial stress.

(Cb5)) was attenuated by xestospongin B, whereas that of IP3R with wild-type (WT) Bcl-2 or with Bcl-2 targeted to mitochondria (Bcl-2 Acta) was increased (Figure 8a). Although these results do not provide a molecular explanation for xestospongin B-induced autophagy, they point to an organelle-speciﬁc interaction between IP3R and Bcl-2, which can be modulated by xestospongin B. Transfection-enforced overexpression of Bcl-2 Cb5 inhibited autophagy induced by starvation, L-690,330, lithium or xestospongin B. In contrast, WT Bcl-2 (which is mostly mitochondrial) or Bcl-2 Acta failed to inhibit autophagy (Figure 8b), although they were expressed at a similar level as Bcl-2 Cb5 (inset in Figure 8b). Very similar results were obtained for the Bcl-2 analogue Bcl-XL. ER-targeted Bcl-XL Cb5 (but not WT Bcl-XL and mitochondrion-targeted Bcl-XL Acta) inhibited autophagy induced by starvation, L-690,330, lithium or xestospongin B (Figure 8c). Of note, none of the Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL constructs inhibited autophagy by thapsigargin or tunicamycin (Figure 8b and c), again suggesting that ER stress-induced and IP3R-regulated autophagy differ in mechanistic terms. Concluding Remarks In this article we provide arguments in favor of the implication of the IP3R in the regulation of autophagy. First, the elevation of IP3 levels using cell-permeable myo-inositol inhibited autophagy induced by starvation (Figure 1b). Similarly, the

pharmacological depletion of IP3 sufﬁced to induce autophagy in human cells (Figure 4), as shown previously for murine and hamster cell lines.12 Second, depletion of IP3R by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or pharmacological blockade of IP3R (Figure 5) was highly efﬁcient in inducing autophagy, which was similar to that induced by starvation (Figure 1) or IP3 depletion (Figure 4) to the extent that it induced the autophagic sequestration of both ER and mitochondria (Figure 7). Pharmacological inhibition of IP3R induced autophagy as quickly and as efﬁciently as ER stress-inducing agents including thapsigargin. At ﬁrst glance, it appears paradoxical that IP3R antagonists (that should increase the luminal ER Ca2 þ ) and the SERCA agonist thapsigargin (that should deplete luminal ER Ca2 þ stores) both induced autophagy. One explanation would be to assume that any kind of perturbation in ER homeostasis would induce autophagy. However, xestospongins do not trigger the unfolded protein response in the ER (as this is the case for thapsigargin), whereas a variety of mechanistically unrelated ER stressors (including brefeldin A and tunicamycin) triggered autophagy. We failed to establish a link between Ca2 þ signaling and IP3R-modulated autophagy. Thus, under conditions in which xestospongin B induced autophagy, no change in cytosolic or ER Ca2 þ levels could be measured (Figure 6a–c), and withdrawal of external Ca2 þ (Figure 6d) or chelation of intracellular Ca2 þ (data not shown) failed to suppress xestospongin B-triggered autophagy. Rather, it appears that xestospongin B affects the protein–protein

In conclusion, our results strongly support a signaling pathway in which IP3 and IP3R act to suppress autophagy. Thus, interruption of this pathway by depletion/inhibition of IP3 or IP3R can unleash the autophagic response. These ﬁndings

(b, c) Impact of WT, mitochondrion-targeted (Acta) or ER-targeted (Cb5) Bcl-2 (b) or Bcl-XL (c) on autophagy induced by IP3R inhibition, ER stress or inositol monophosphatase inhibition. Cells were transfected with LC3-GFP together with the indicated constructs, and 24 h later the cells were exposed to different stimuli for 12 h. Then, LC3-GFP redistribution (X7S.D., n ¼ 3) was determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy. Asterisks indicate signiﬁcant (Po0.01) inhibitory effects of ER-targeted Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. The inserts in b and c conﬁrm the expression of WT, mitochondrion-targeted (Acta) or ER-targeted (Cb5) Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, respectively

HeLa cells (1 Â 106 cells) were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 41C and lysed as described previously.7 Forty micrograms of protein were loaded on a 5–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated for 1 h Cell Death and Differentiation

in PBS–Tween 20 (0.05%) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibody Anti-Beclin-1 (Santacruz), anti-GADD34 (Abcam), anti-IP3-RI (Calbiochem), antiIP3-RIII (BD Biosciences) and anti-hVps34 (Zymed) were incubated overnight at 41C and revealed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and the SuperSignal West Pico chemoluminiscent substrate (Pierce). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon) was used to control equal loading. Rat-1 ﬁbroblasts (8 Â 106 cells) were collected, lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described16 using anti-Bcl-2 (SantaCruz) antibody and
