[8] G Protein‐Coupled Receptor Internalization Assays in the High‐Content Screening Format
By DOROTHEA HAASEN, ANDREAS SCHNAPP, MARTIN J. VALLER , and RALF HEILKER
Abstract

High‐content screening (HCS), a combination of ﬂuorescence microscopic imaging and automated image analysis, has become a frequently applied tool to study test compound effects in cellular disease‐modeling systems. This chapter describes the measurement of G protein‐coupled receptor (GPCR) internalization in the HCS format using a high‐throughput, confocal cellular imaging device. GPCRs are the most successful group of therapeutic targets on the pharmaceutical market. Accordingly, the search for compounds that interfere with GPCR function in a speciﬁc and selective way is a major focus of the pharmaceutical industry today. This chapter describes methods for the ligand‐induced internalization of GPCRs labeled previously with either a ﬂuorophore‐conjugated ligand or an antibody directed against an N‐terminal tag of the GPCR. Both labeling techniques produce robust assay formats. Complementary to other functional GPCR drug discovery assays, internalization assays enable a pharmacological analysis of test compounds. We conclude that GPCR internalization assays represent a valuable medium/ high‐throughput screening format to determine the cellular activity of GPCR ligands.

Introduction

Fluorescence microscopy has been widely employed in academic cell biology research as a nondestructive and sensitive technique to visualize subcellular structures and to monitor intracellular protein translocations. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has displayed an increasing preference to apply cell biological test systems in the early drug discovery process. Particularly, a novel technique generally referred to as high‐content screening (HCS) has been introduced that combines high‐resolution ﬂuorescence microscopy with automated image analysis (Almholt et al., 2004; Conway et al., 1999; Ghosh et al., 2000; Li et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2001). The biomolecules of interest are labeled with different ﬂuorophores that may be monitored in parallel at different wavelengths (multiplexing). Image analysis software quantiﬁes the distribution and brightness of the

ﬂuorophore‐labeled biomolecules in the cells. In a kinetic mode, this enables the visualization of intracellular protein trafﬁcking as a consequence of a pharmaceutical drug effect. Apart from protein trafﬁcking (Almholt et al., 2004), HCS can provide information on the phosphorylation state of target proteins (Russello, 2004), on cellular proliferation (Bhawe et al., 2004) or apoptosis (Steff et al., 2001), on morphological changes such as neurite outgrowth (Simpson et al., 2001), on modiﬁcations of the cytoskeleton (Giuliano, 2003; Olson and Olmsted, 1999), on cellular movements (Soll et al., 2000), and on other overall changes of the ﬂuorescence such as for the analysis of gap junctions (Li et al., 2003). By these means, HCS provides several advantages over normal high‐ throughput screening (HTS). Cellular HTS conventionally monitors the mean response of the whole cell population of a microtiter plate (MTP) well. In contrast, HCS can distinguish the individual response of many cells in an MTP well that may differ with respect to the differentiation, the stage of the cell cycle, the state of transfection, or due to natural variability. As a result, heterogeneous pharmaceutical drug effects on mixed cell populations may be analyzed in a single MTP well. ‘‘On‐target’’ drug effects may be cross‐correlated with other phenomena such as cellular toxicity (Wolff et al., 2006). Compound artefacts such as cell lysis or compound autoﬂuorescence may be detected. HCS permits work with endogenous targets and/ or primary cells using speciﬁc antibodies or morphological image analysis. In this way, novel assay formats can be enabled that do not depend on an overall change of ﬂuorescence or luminescence intensity from the whole MTP well.
High‐Throughput Confocal Cellular Imaging Systems

HCS has beneﬁted from the introduction of high‐throughput confocal cellular imaging systems. In confocal optics, the spatial resolution in the vertical direction is improved dramatically by reducing background ﬂuorescence from above or below the focal plane. This way, confocality enables the observation of cells that adhere to the bottom of a microtiter plate well without interference from dead cells, free ﬂuorophore, or autoﬂuorescent particles above the cellular layer. This increased optical resolution is particularly important to permit the visualization of biomolecule translocation processes across the complex subcellular membrane, vesicle, and organelle systems within eukaryotic cells. In classic confocal optics (Wilson, 1990), the restriction to ﬂuorescence emission from a speciﬁc focal plane is achieved by guiding the emitted light through a pinhole. Using this so‐called ‘‘point scanning,’’ the ﬂuorescence

emission from a femtoliter‐sized observation volume within the focal plane is guided to the photon detector. However, the available confocal point scanning microscopes, which are based on this optical assembly, are generally too slow for drug screening applications. Three ﬂuorescence microscopic cellular imagers combine a high throughput with confocal optics (Zemanova et al., 2003): the INCell Analyzer 3000 (Glaser, 2004; Haasen et al., 2006) from GE Healthcare Biosciences (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), the Opera (Eggeling et al., 2003) from Evotec Technologies GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), and the Pathway Bioimager (Vanek and Tunon, 2002) from Becton‐Dickinson Bioimaging Systems (Rockville, MD). To reduce measuring time, the Opera and the Pathway Bioimager employ a Nipkow disk (Nakano, 2002) to project ﬂuorescence from several confocal volumes in parallel to a charged‐coupled device (CCD) camera, whereas the INCell Analyzer 3000 employs line scanning (Glaser, 2004) through a confocal slit. The imaging and image analysis for the examples given in this chapter are described for the INCell Analyzer 3000. The INCell Analyzer 3000 provides three laser lines for ﬂuorescence excitation: two (364 nm, 488 nm) from an argon ion laser and one (647 nm) from a krypton laser (Fig. 1). The three laser lines are individually guided through neutral density ﬁlters but may be combined for parallel excitation. After reﬂection by a beam splitter they are autofocused via a 40Â Nikon ELWD Plan Fluor/0.6 NA objective to the adherent cell layer at the bottom of the assay MTP well. The 40Â Nikon extra‐long working distance (ELWD) Plan Fluor/0.6 NA objective provides the combined beneﬁts of a large ﬁeld of view (FOV; 0.56 mm2) with a good optical resolution. Fluorescence emission light is collected through the same objective, passed through the aforementioned beam splitter, and guided through a confocal slit. The confocal slit serves to exclude emission light from above or below the focal layer. The light is split into up to three wavelength ranges, which permits simultaneous confocal imaging using three 12‐bit À35 cooled CCD cameras. Prior to cellular imaging, a ﬂat ﬁeld correction for inhomogeneous illumination of the scanned area is carried out using an MTP well containing a homogeneous ﬂuorophore solution.

GPCR Internalization Assays

GPCRs are seven‐transmembrane helix proteins (Ji et al., 1998), typically transmitting an extracellular signal into the cell by the conformational rearrangement of their helices and by the subsequent binding and activation of an intracellular heterotrimeric G protein (Perez and Karnik, 2005). In this way, GPCRs act as sensors of exogenous signals, which they transduce into

Two laser lines (364 and 488 nm) from an argon ion laser and one laser line (647 nm) from a krypton laser are guided individually through neutral density ﬁlters. All three laser lines may then be combined. After reﬂection by a beam splitter they are autofocused via a 40Â Nikon extra‐long working distance (ELWD) Plan Fluor/0.6 NA objective to the adherent cell layer in the assay MTP. Emission light is collected through the same objective, passed through the above beam splitter, and guided through a confocal slit.

cytoplasmic signaling pathways. The ﬁrst GPCRs to be cloned were bovine opsin (Nathans and Hogness, 1983) and the ‐adrenergic receptor (Dixon et al., 1986). Since then, a large gene family of a further $2000 GPCRs has been reported, classiﬁed into more than 100 subfamilies according to sequence homology, ligand structure, and receptor function. GPCRs are the most important class of therapeutic targets (Ma and Zemmel, 2002). Approximately 45% of all known pharmaceutical drugs

are directed against transmembrane receptors (Drews, 2000), largely against GPCRs. GPCRs are involved in a broad diversity of physiological functions, such as pain perception, chemotaxis, neurotransmission, cardiovascular actions, and metabolism, and ﬁnding ways to modulate GPCR signaling remains a major focus of pharmaceutical research. The interaction between GPCRs and their extracellular ligands has proven to be an attractive point of interference for therapeutic agents. For that reason, the pharmaceutical industry has developed biochemical drug discovery assays to investigate these ligand–GPCR interactions, such as scintillation proximity assays (Alouani, 2000) or the less frequently employed ﬂuorescence polarization assays (Banks and Harvey, 2002; Harris et al., 2003) and ﬂuorescence intensity distribution analysis assays (Auer et al., 1998; Zemanova et al., 2003). All the aforementioned biochemical binding assays rely on the competition of the test compound with a labeled reference ligand. An obvious disadvantage of these binding assays is the risk of missing noncompetitive, allosteric ligands. Further, the binding assay does not elucidate functional aspects of test compound activity, such as full/partial agonism, neutral antagonism, inverse agonism, or positive modulation. To expand compound testing in this direction, there is a need for functional high‐throughput assays, possibly measuring GPCR activity in a more physiological, cellular background. GPCR signal transduction mechanisms have been characterized in three major classes: Gq (phospholipase C), Gi, and Gs (inhibition and stimulation of cAMP production, respectively). If the GPCR of interest signals via phospholipase C, the most broadly applied cell‐based technique to measure GPCR activation is the Ca release assay, either measured in a ﬂuorescent format using Ca‐sensitive ﬂuorophores (Sullivan et al., 1999) or in a luminescent format using aequorin and a chemiluminescent substrate (Dupriez et al., 2002). Alternatively, if the GPCR of interest signals via adenylate cyclase, the cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) content may be determined using various detection technologies (Gabriel et al., 2003). Apart from the aforementioned assays measuring the cellular signaling via G proteins, the functional activation of GPCRs may be monitored by agonist‐induced receptor internalization (Milligan, 2003). The broad applicability of GPCR internalization assays (Fig. 2; scheme of GPCR internalization) is based on the common phenomenon of GPCR ‘‘desensitization’’ and has been demonstrated for numerous GPCRs (Ferguson, 2001; Krupnick and Benovic, 1998; Oakley et al., 2002). In the desensitization process, GPCR kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate agonist‐activated GPCRs on serine and threonine residues. Arrestins are cytoplasmic proteins that are recruited to the plasma membrane by GRK‐phosphorylated GPCRs (Barak et al., 1997).

FIG. 2. Scheme of GPCR internalization assays. After agonist stimulation, the GPCR becomes phosphorylated by a GRK on its carboxy‐terminal tail. Arrestin is recruited to the plasma membrane by the GRK‐phosphorylated GPCR. Arrestin then targets the GPCR to clathrin‐coated pits for endocytosis. Depending on the stability of the speciﬁc GPCR–arrestin interaction, arrestin is either released after the formation of clathrin‐coated pits or cointernalized with the GPCR‐loaded vesicles. The internalization process may be monitored by a ﬂuorophore label on the agonist, on the N or C terminus of the GPCR, or on the arrestin.

Arrestins then uncouple the GPCR from the cognate G protein (Lohse et al., 1992; Pippig et al., 1993) and target the desensitized receptors to clathrin‐ coated pits for endocytosis (Goodman et al., 1996; Laporte et al., 2000). In contrast to Ca release and cAMP assays, the internalization assay is independent of the individual GPCR intracellular signaling route. Thus, desensitization occurs independently of the associated G protein subclass or of the class of GPCR ligand. Further, the imaging‐based GPCR internalization assays offer the general advantages of the HCS format as described earlier.
Internalization Assay and Image Analysis Protocols

Fluorophore‐Labeled Ligand Internalization One means to monitor the internalization of a GPCR is to cointernalize a speciﬁc, ﬂuorophore‐labeled ligand. In the following example protocol a tetramethylrhodamine‐labeled endothelin‐1 (TMR‐ET‐1) is used as a

Imaging. For this protocol, the ﬁxed cells are imaged on the IN Cell Analyzer 3000 instrument employing the 488‐nm laser line (121 mW; attenuated by a neutral density ﬁlter to 10%) combined with the 595BP60 emission ﬁlter for TMR‐ET‐1 and the 364‐nm laser line (58 mW; attenuated by a neutral density ﬁlter to 50%) combined with the 450BP65 emission ﬁlter for Hoechst. Fluorescence emission is recorded sequentially in the green and in the blue channel. Prior to cellular imaging, a ﬂat ﬁeld correction for inhomogeneous illumination of the scanned area is carried out using an MTP well containing 50 nM Oregon Green and 20 M Alexa Fluor 350 solution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). All measurements are conducted at room temperature. Figure 3 shows examples of representative images from wells ﬁxed at different time points. The intracellular ﬂuorescence of TMR‐ET‐1 increases over time (Fig. 3A–C) due to the formation of small endocytic vesicles that accumulate in larger structures close to the nuclear compartment. The cointernalization of labeled ET‐1 can be competed with a 10‐fold excess of unlabeled ligand (Fig. 3D). Image Analysis and Quantiﬁcation. The cointernalization of a ﬂuorophore‐ labeled ligand with its speciﬁc GPCR upon receptor activation results in the formation of grain‐like objects within the cell. Here, the granularity analysis module GRN0 of the IN Cell Analyzer 3000 analysis package is used as a method to identify, analyze, and quantify these grain‐like structures. The granularity algorithm employs a two‐color image composed of a marker channel and a signal channel. The marker channel image (blue) is employed to identify ﬂuorescently stained cell nuclei, to classify each identiﬁed nucleus as an object (Fig. 3E), and to deﬁne a region of measurement by the dilation of the nuclear mask for each individual cell. In the signal channel image (green) the region of the dilated nuclear mask (Fig. 3F) is then analyzed for the presence of grains. The algorithm deﬁnes grains as distinct regions characterized by two parameters: a speciﬁc size and a deﬁned intensity difference as compared to the region of the cell immediately surrounding the grains (Fig. 3G). The Fgrain value, which is the scaled measure of the fraction of cellular ﬂuorescence

Adapted analysis parameter settings are indicated by the nuclear mask (E), the measurement region of the dilated nuclear mask (large boxes; F and G), and the grain regions (small boxes; G). Images represent one‐fourth (A–D) and one‐sixteenth (E and F) of a full‐size image (750 m Â 750 m). Quantiﬁcation of the grain structures (size: 20 pixels, intensity gradient: 2.0) is performed on the basis of Fgrain values for two stable cell lines expressing ETAR, ETA‐C1 (high expression level, 60–150 pmol/mg protein), and ETA‐C2 (medium expression level, 17 pmol/mg protein) stimulated with 4 nM TMR‐ET‐1 only (comp À) or 4 nM TMR‐ET‐1 þ 40 nM ET‐1 (comp þ). Values are plotted as means of six images Æ SD.

present in the qualifying grains, is used as the numeric output parameter. It is calculated as
Fgrain ¼ Sum of pixel values in test boxes corresponding to valid grains Â 1000 Sum of pixel values in dilated mask region

The quantiﬁcation of Fgrains by the granularity algorithm veriﬁes that in two cell lines stably expressing different levels of ETAR the cointernalization of TMR‐ET‐1 can be competed by unlabeled ET‐1 (Fig. 3H). A 10‐fold excess of unlabeled ligand reduced the Fgrain value from approximately 136 to 5 for the highly expressing cell line ETA‐C1 and from approximately 167 to 12 for ETA‐C2 with slightly reduced expression levels of ETAR. Fluorophore‐Labeled Antibody (b2AR) An alternative assay technology to follow the internalization of a GPCR is to cointernalize a speciﬁc antibody, directed either against an extracellular domain of the receptor or against an amino‐terminal epitope tag. In the following example protocol the internalization of a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) epitope‐tagged human 2AR expressed in HEK‐293 cells is described. In this setup, the primary anti‐VSVG‐antibody is cointernalized with the receptor upon agonist stimulation and, in a second step, is detected by a ﬂuorophore‐labeled secondary antibody by immunoﬂuorescence staining of ﬁxed, permeabilized cells. In this way it is possible to determine the extent of agonist behavior. By way of illustration, the response of the 2AR to the partial agonist salmeterol (Sears and Lotvall, 2005) and the full agonist formoterol (Sears and Lotvall, 2005) is shown. The molecular mechanisms of receptor tolerance summarized earlier have also been shown to be involved in the desensitization of 2AR (Ferguson, 2001; Lefkowitz, 1998; Su et al., 1980). In the context of 2AR the extent of functional desensitization induced by different ‐adrenoceptor agonists is variable, and a correlation between agonist efﬁcacy and receptor desensitization has been shown (Benovic et al., 1988; Clark et al., 1999; January et al., 1997, 1998).

carried out using an MTP well containing 50 nM Cy5 solution (GE Healthcare Biosciences) and 50 M Alexa Fluor 350 solution (Molecular Probes, Inc.). All measurements are conducted at room temperature. Figure 4 shows representative images of antibody cointernalization in 2AR‐expressing cells treated with a full agonist, formoterol, and a partial agonist, salmeterol. Results show that after stimulation with the full agonist, the red ﬂuorescence representing the subcellular localization of 2AR moves from the plasma membrane to at ﬁrst smaller vesicles (5 to 10 min) and then to larger vesicles (10 to 20 min) that accumulate in a compartment close to the nucleus at 20 to 30 min post stimulation. In contrast, the response to the partial agonist is delayed, starting with the formation of small vesicles at 10 min post stimulation and reaching a maximal response at 30 min post stimulation. Moreover, the partial response can be seen to apply to each individual cell, resulting in two receptor subpopulations: one that internalizes and another that remains localized at the plasma membrane. In the case of activation by either a full or a partial agonist, the total intracellular red ﬂuorescence decreases at 60 min post stimulation and is reduced to almost background levels at 120 min post stimulation, most likely due to targeting to the lysosomal pathway and degradation.

Image Analysis and Quantiﬁcation. Corresponding to the example described in the preceding section for ligand cointernalization experiments, the granularity analysis module GRN0 of the IN Cell Analyzer 3000 analysis package is used as a method to identify, analyze, and quantify the internalized receptor in these experiments. In this case, the red channel image is deﬁned as the signal channel. The GRN0 analysis parameters are optimized for nuclear morphology and the internalization response of the cell line is employed. Changes in the granular appearance during the endocytic process provide a means to quantify the extent of the cellular response and to distinguish speciﬁc stages of endocytosis. Therefore, image analysis is performed setting different sizes and intensity gradients of grain‐like objects. Grains are categorized in four subclasses according to their appearance (small, medium, large, and large bright), and their abundance is analyzed over the time course of the experiment (Fig. 5). As a representative example, upon activation by the full agonist formoterol, maximum values of 260 Fgrains are observed, as compared to an Fgrain value of 125 following activation by the partial agonist salmeterol. In case of the full agonist, all grain subclasses are present already 5 min post stimulation, reaching a maximum around 10 min for small, 20 min for medium, and 30 min for large and large bright vesicles (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in the case of the partial agonist, none of the vesicle subclasses are present at 5 min post stimulation, and all subclasses reach their maximum at 30 min post stimulation (Fig. 5B), indicating that the internalization response proceeds differently in comparison to full agonist stimulation. In Fig. 6, the parameters for medium class vesicles are used to analyze the images from a dose–response experiment for the two agonists. Stimulation with the full agonist results in an efﬁcacy comparable to the standard control isoproterenol (Fig. 6A), whereas the partial agonist reaches only 45% of the maximum response of the standard (Fig. 6B). In this way it can be shown that the antibody cointernalization approach is a sensitive assay system not only to determine EC50 values, but also to classify agonists according to their full or partial response.
Conclusions and Outlook

Both the labeled reference ligand internalization and the labeled GPCR internalization methods can produce stable HCS assays. Both formats provide advantageous, partially complementary features in the characterization of GPCR ligand test compounds. Thus, test compounds can be qualiﬁed as agonists or antagonists in the ‘‘labeled GPCR’’ internalization experiments. In the aforementioned assay protocol for the 2AR, the test

compounds are analyzed for their agonistic properties. Alternatively, if the test compounds are preincubated with GPCR expressing cells, the absence of reference agonist‐induced GPCR internalization can indicate antagonistic/inverse agonistic properties of the test compound. If the constitutive internalization and recycling rates of the GPCR are sufﬁcient, the inverse agonists may be distinguished from the neutral antagonists by an enrichment of the receptor at the plasma membrane. As a further experimental modiﬁcation to enable the identiﬁcation of positive modulators, if the reference agonist is added at approximately EC10 concentration, a preincubation

with a positive modulator compound will increase the internalization rate signiﬁcantly. A challenge in GPCR‐labeling assays is that antibodies against the extracellular portion of the native receptor are not always available. Further, it is important that the GPCR‐labeling antibody does not interfere with the ligand‐binding site or produce a functional effect itself. To reduce the probability of such issues, an N‐terminal tag may be attached to the GPCR of interest so that a tag‐directed antibody may be used for GPCR detection. In addition to the aforementioned GPCR‐labeling assays, the ‘‘labeled ligand’’ protocol makes it possible to distinguish between orthosteric and allosteric GPCR‐binding test compounds. Orthosterically acting test compounds block the binding of the labeled reference ligand to the cell surface and cannot therefore be analyzed further in ‘‘labeled ligand’’ assays. An allosterically acting test compound permits the binding of the labeled reference ligand to the plasma membrane‐exposed GPCRs. If the mechanism of action is antagonistic, a preincubation of the allosteric test compound prevents cointernalization of the labeled reference ligand. If the mechanism is positive modulatory, a preincubation of the allosteric test compound leads to an increased rate of labeled ligand internalization. With regard to agonistic, allosteric test compounds, the interpretation of experimental results becomes more challenging: if added at the same time as the labeled reference ligand, depending on the ratio of kinetics, potencies, and efﬁcacies between test compound and reference ligand, the test compounds may either increase or decrease the ‘‘labeled ligand’’ internalization rate. The internalization assays described in this chapter employ an extracellular, ligand/GPCR‐labeling step at the plasma membrane. Therefore, the initially increasing number and intensity of intracellular, ﬂuorescent granules describe the rate of receptor internalization. After a few minutes, however, (i) the newly synthesized protein from the secretory pathway reaching the cell surface and (ii) recycling and/or (iii) degradation of ligand‐ or antibody‐ labeled GPCRs will be superimposed on the internalization kinetics. To help unravel these complex intracellular receptor trafﬁcking pathways, it is possible to work with a second label that describes the overall distribution of the GPCR, such as a ﬂuorescent protein label at the C terminus of the receptor (Xia et al., 2004) or to use a GPCR‐detecting antibody on ﬁxed and permeabilized cells. Such a second label enables observation of the ligand‐induced net shift of local GPCR concentrations between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Further, such labeling provides an impression of the GPCR distribution in the cells prior to ligand stimulation, thereby facilitating the overall investigation of test compound‐induced changes. The option to use ﬁxed‐cell internalization endpoint protocols, as described earlier for the model system of the 2A receptor, is advantageous

for automated liquid handling and ofﬂine imaging. Thus, receptor internalization assays can provide robust medium and/or high‐throughput screening formats and excellently complement the drug discovery tool spectrum for the GPCR target class.
