Supplemental Figure 1. Kinetics of Env-mediated autophagosome formation and Beclin 1 accumulation. (A) Target HEK/CD4.403/CXCR4 cells were transfected with pEGFP (GFP) or pEGFP-LC3 (GFP-LC3) by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and cocultured for 1 to 3 days with effector cells expressing, or not, Env or treated by 1 μM Rapa. Target adherent cells were examined by epifluorescence. Data are representative of three independent experiments and more than 100 cells were counted by two investigators. (Magnification: X63) (B) Immunoblot analysis of Beclin 1 in A2.01/CD4.403, HEK/CD4.403/CXCR4 and HEK/CD4.403 cells cocultured for 1 to 3 days with cells expressing, or not, Env. Quantification of Beclin 1 expression was performed as described in Methods.

Supplemental Figure 2. Suramin blocks Env-mediated autophagy. GFP-LC3 transfected target HEK/CD4.403/CXCR4 cells were cocultured with effector CEM or 8.E5 cells in the presence or absence of 50 μM suramin, a compound that binds the gp120 V3 loop, and autophagy was analyzed as described in figure 3. (Magnification: X63).
