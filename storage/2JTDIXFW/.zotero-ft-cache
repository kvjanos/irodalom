Inverse PCR Approach to Cloning cDNA Ends
Sheng-He Huang 1. Introduction Since thefirstreport on cDNA cloning in 1972 (1), this technology has been developed into a powerful and universal tool in the isolation, characterization, and analysis of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. But the conventional methods of cDNA cloning require much effort to generate a library that is packaged in phage or plasmid and then survey a large number of recombinant phages or plasmids. There are three major limitations in those methods. First, substantial amount (at least 1 |ug) of purified mRNA is needed as starting material to generate libraries of sufficient diversity (2). Second, the intrinsic difficulty of multiple sequential enzymatic reactions required for cDNA cloning often leads to low yields and truncated clones (3). Finally, screening of a library with hybridization technique is time consuming. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology can simplify and improve cDNA cloning. Using PCR with two gene-specific primers, a piece of known sequence cDNA can be specifically and efficiently amplified and isolated from very small numbers (<10'') of cells (4). However, it is often difficult to isolate full-length cDNA copies of mRNA on the basis of very limited sequence information. The unknown sequence flanking a small stretch of the known sequence of DNA cannot be amplified by the conventional PCR. Recently, anchored PCR (5-7) and inverse PCR (IPCR) (8-10) have been developed to resolve this problem. Anchored PCR techniques have a common point: DNA cloning goes from a small stretch of known DNA sequence to the flanking unknown sequence region with the aid of a gene-specific primer at one end and a universal primer at other end. Because of only one gene-specific primer m the anchored PCR, it is easier to get a high level of nonspecific amplification by PCR than with two gene-specific primers (10,11). The major advantage of

Fig. 1. Diagram of IPCR for cDNA cloning. The procedure consists of five steps: reverse transcription, synthesis of second-stranded cDNA, circularization of doublestranded cDNA, reopen the circle DNA, and amplification of reverse DNA fragment. The black and open bars represent the known and unknown sequence regions of double-stranded cDNA, respectively

IPCR is to amplify the flanking unknown sequence by using two gene-specific primers. At first, IPCR was successfully used in the amplification of genomic DNA segments that lie outside the boundaries of known sequence (8,9). There is a new procedure that extends this technique to the cloning of unknown cDNA sequence from total RNA (10). Double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from RNA and ligated end to end (Fig. 1). Circularized cDNA is nicked by selected restriction enzyme or denatured by NaOH treatment (12,13). The reopened or denatured circular cDNA is then amplified by two gene-specific primers. Recently, this technique has been efficiently used in cloning full-length cDNAs (14—16). The following protocol was used to amplify cDNA ends for the human stress-related protein ERp72 (10) (Fig. 2).

1. For maximum efficiency of intramolecular ligation, a low concentration of cDNA should be used m the ligation mix. High density of cDNA may enhance the level of heterogeneous ligation, which creates nonspecific amplification 2 Cleavage or denaturation of circularized double-stranded cDNA is important since circular double-stranded DNA tends to form supercoil and is poor template for PCR (23). Circularized double-stranded DNA is only good for amplification of a short DNA fragment 3. The following three ways can be considered to introduce nicks in circulanzed DNA. Boilmg is a simple and common way However, because of the unusual secondary structure of some circular double-stranded DNA, sometimes this method is not sufficient in nicking and denaturing circular double-stranded DNA. A second method is selected restriction enzyme digestion The ideal restriction site is located in the known sequence region of cDNA. In most cases, it is difficult to make the nght choice of a restriction enzyme because the restnction pattern m unidentified region of cDNA is unknown. If an appropriate enzyme is not available, EDTAoligonucleotide-directed specific cleavage may be tned (24,25). Oligonucleotide linked to EDTA-Fe at T can bind specifically to double-stranded DNA by triplehelix formation and produce double-stranded cleavage at the binding site 4 Alkali denaturation has been successfully used to prepare plasmid DNA templates for PCR and DNA sequencing (12,13,26). This method should be feasible in denaturing circularized double-stranded cDNA 5 Inclusion of T4 RNA ligase or hexammecobalt chloride can enhance the efficiency of blunt-end ligation of double-stranded DNA catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase (27). 6 IPCR can be used to efficiently and rapidly amplify regions of unknown sequence flanking any identified segment of cDNA or genomic DNA. This technique does not need construction and screening of DNA libraries to obtain additional unidentified DNA sequence information Some recombinant phage or plasmid may be unstable in bacteria and amplified libraries tend to lose them (23). IPCR eliminates this problem.
