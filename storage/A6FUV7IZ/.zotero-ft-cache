Abstract
This chapter presents a selection of the best available data on the functioning and performance of the South African health system. It also questions whether the data provide evidence of a system that is truly based on Primary Health Care principles. Accordingly, it draws attention to data on the social determinants of health, which received particular attention at Alma Ata and have been highlighted once again with the release of the World Health Organization’s World Health Report this year. The available evidence reflects enormous variability in the quality of information in the different health information systems as well as variability in the risk factors and determinants of health, health care delivery, as well as health outcomes. Overall the information available suggests that while progress has been made with policy formulation and some inputs (e.g. financing) and processes (e.g. immunisation), inadequate provision and maldistribution of human resources linked with incomplete implementation of policies has resulted in ongoing inequities. Some outcome and impact indicators, measured in terms of morbidity and mortality, show either little improvement or even deterioration over time. The implementation of both health care delivery and information systems do not accommodate the interdepartmental and interdisciplinary responses that are required to adequately address the social determinants of poor health and achieve comprehensive Primary Health Care. This challenge has to be faced in relation not only to infectious diseases, but also in relation to the increasing burden of chronic non-communicable diseases. The sections for which data are included are given in the table of contents following.

Introduction
This	year,	2008,	is	the	30th	anniversary	of	the	International	 Conference	on	Primary	Health	Care,	held	at	Alma	Ata,	then	 the	capital	of	the	Soviet	Republic	of	Kazakhstan	[Declaration	 of	Alma	Ata].	This	provides	a	wonderful	opportunity	to	look	 back	at	the	principles	contained	in	the	Declaration	of	Alma	 Ata,	and	also	at	the	ways	in	which	actual	policy	and	practice	 have	 deviated	 from	 these	 principles	 over	 time.	 From	 the	 perspective	of	health	informatics,	it	provides	an	opportunity	 to	 ask	 whether	 existing	 health	 information	 systems	 are	 providing	data	on	the	elements	that	constitute	the	Primary	 Health	Care	(PHC)	approach,	which	forms	the	basis	for	many	 countries’	health	policy	stances.	 Delegates	to	the	Alma	Ata	conference	reaffirmed	that	health	 should	 be	 seen	 as	 “a state of physical, mental and social wellbeing, not only the absence of disease or infirmity”.	 They	also	defined	health	as	a	fundamental	human	right.	The	 Conference	provided	the	definition	for	PHC,	as	care	“based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination”.	It	was	also	 defined	as	incorporating	at	least	the	following	elements: ➤	 “education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of preventing and controlling them” ➤	 ➤	 “promotion of food supply and proper nutrition” “an adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation” ➤	 “maternal and child health care, including family planning” ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 “immunization against the major infectious diseases” “prevention and control of locally endemic diseases” “appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries” ➤	 “provision of essential drugs”	 [Declaration	 of	 Alma	 Ata]. This	 chapter	 will,	 in	 addition	 to	 presenting	 a	 selection	 of	 the	best	available	data	on	the	functioning	and	performance	 of	 the	 South	 African	 health	 system,	 focus	 on	 whether	 the	 available	data	provide	an	adequate	picture	of	a	system	that	 purports	 to	 be	 based	 on	 PHC	 principles.	 It	 will	 also	 draw	 attention	 to	 data	 on	 the	 determinants	 of	 health,	 which	 received	particular	attention	at	Alma	Ata. The	anniversary	of	Alma	Ata	has	also	been	accompanied	by	 critical	appraisals	of	the	application	of	the	principles	of	PHC	 Gillam	 has	 noted	 that	 “[e]ffective primary health care is more than the simple summation of individual technological interventions”,	 and	 that	 “[i]ts power resides in linking different sectors and disciplines, integrating different elements of disease management, stressing early prevention, and the maintenance of health”	[BMJ	336(536-8)].	Tellingly,	 he	 noted	 that	 “the concept of the empowered consumer engaged in shared decision making is far from what was implied by the term community participation”.	 It	 remains	 far	 easier	 though	 to	 measure	 the	 provision	 of	 a	 single	 technological	intervention	(such	as	immunisation	coverage)	 than	to	measure	the	degree	to	which	communities	are	truly	 mobilised. In	South	Africa	the	30th	anniversary	of	Alma	Ata	was	marked	 by	 the	 Birchwood	 National	 Consultative	 Health	 Forum	 Declaration	 on	 PHC,	 which	 resolved	 “[t]hat the revisioned and revitalized primary health care strategy for South Africa will include: 1. Advocating for an increase in the resource allocation for primary health care, by at least doubling the current per capita expenditure over the next ten years. ➤ ➤ ➤ globally.	The	Italian	Global	Health	Watch,	for	example,	drew	 attention	 to	 the	 impact	 of	 what	 they	 termed	 a	 ‘counterrevolution’,	 the	 decision	 to	 pursue	 selective	 rather	 than	 comprehensive	care	[Social	Medicine	3(36-48)].	To	many,	this	 narrow-focus	 version	 of	 PHC,	 with	 targeted	 action	 aimed	 at	 “oral rehydration to combat diarrhoea, vaccinations, promotion of breast feeding and the systematic use of the growth chart”	 became	 well-known	 as	 the	 GOBI-FFF,	 substituting	 for	 a	 more	 comprehensive	 approach.	 The	 recommendation	 offered	 by	 this	 group	 could	 be	 applied	 directly	in	South	Africa: ➤	 “Ensure universal access to basic health care, giving absolute priority to the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the population (children and women); Reinforce whole health systems, instead of basing strategies on vertical programs; Strengthen infrastructures, organization and control of programs, purchase and distribution of essential medicines (including antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of AIDS); And, above all, invest in human resources within the public health sector through training, motivation, appropriate and just remuneration of health personnel that will help block the drain of staff to the private sector and abroad.”

Better alignment at district level of key interventions that impact on health, notably provision of water and sanitation, early childhood development, recreational programmes, health education and other activities that focus on encouraging healthy lifestyles especially amongst the youth in particular. ➤

human resources policies, plans, development and strengthening of national management systems and employment policies; support countries to identify and put in place mechanisms personnel.” A	 key	 motivating	 force	 for	 the	 implementation	 of	 such	 recommendations	has	been	the	‘15	by	2015’	campaign.a	This	 campaign,	aimed	at	ensuring	quality	health	for	all,	has	called	 on	donor	organisations	to	allocate	15%	of	all	grants	towards	 strengthening	 the	 PHC	 system	 in	 recipient	 countries.	 The	 target	date	chosen	(2015)	is	the	same	as	for	the	Millennium	 Development	Goals	(MDGs). The	World	Health	Report	2007	was	sub-titled	‘A	safer	future:	 global	 public	 health	 security	 in	 the	 21st	 century’	 [World	 Health	 Report	 2007].	 The	 focus	 in	 2007	 was	 on	 how	 “the world is at increasing risk of disease outbreaks, epidemics, industrial accidents, natural disasters and other health emergencies which can rapidly become threats to global public health security”.	It	was	noted	that	infectious	diseases	 are	 not	 only	 spreading	 faster	 but	 emerging	 at	 a	 more	 rapid	 rate.	 For	 example,	 there	 are	 now	 “nearly 40 diseases that were unknown a generation ago”.	 One	 of	 the	 threats	 identified	 was	 the	 emergence	 of	 extensively	 drug	 resistant	 tuberculosis	(XDR-TB),	described	as	“essentially a man-made problem”,	“created primarily by inadequate health systems and the resulting failures in programme management, especially poor supervision of health staff and of patients’ treatment regimens, disruptions in drug supplies, and poor clinical management”.	 World	 Health	 Day	 in	 2008	 focused	 on	 “[p]rotecting health from climate change”	[World	Health	Day	2008].	In	a	sense,	 this	harks	back	to	the	focus	at	Alma	Ata	on	dealing	effectively	 with	 the	 determinants	 of	 health.	 A	 clear	 statement	 was	 made:	 “climate change endangers health in fundamental ways”.	Five	major	potential	consequences	of	climate	change	 were	identified: ➤	 “[r]ising temperatures and more frequent droughts and floods can compromise food security. Increases in malnutrition are expected to be especially severe in countries where large populations depend on rain-fed subsistence farming. Malnutrition, much of it caused by periodic droughts, is already responsible for an estimated 3.5 million deaths each year.” ➤ “more frequent extreme weather events mean more potential deaths and injuries caused by storms and floods. In addition, flooding can be followed by

10. Re-orientate all health workers and managers to the Primary Health Care approach. 11. Include the PHC approach in the training of health workers to ensure their appropriate professional socialisation.”	[Birchwood	Declaration] To	 a	 large	 extent,	 these	 commitments	 mirror	 the	 recommendations	 of	 the	 World	 Health	 Organization’s	 (WHO)	review	of	PHC	in	the	African	region	[PHC	in	Africa].	 The	review	found	that	“PHC policy formation had been well articulated in the national health policies by most countries, however, the extent to which PHC policies encompassed equity, community participation, inter-sectoral collaboration and affordability is still questionable”.	Accordingly,	the	key	 recommendations	were	to:	 ➤	 “harmonise health sector reforms with PHC to ensure that initiatives promote equity and quality in health services; ➤ improve the fairness of financing policies and strategies and service coverage for the poor; ➤ support countries to address their particular human resource needs through clear articulation of

outbreaks of diseases, such as cholera, especially when water and sanitation services are damaged or destroyed.” ➤ “both scarcities of water, which is essential for hygiene, and excess water due to more frequent and torrential rainfall will increase the burden of diarrhoeal disease, which is spread through contaminated food and water.” ➤ “heatwaves, especially in urban ‘heat islands’, can directly increase morbidity and mortality, mainly in elderly people with cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Apart from heatwaves, higher temperatures can increase ground-level ozone and hasten the onset of the pollen season, contributing to asthma attacks.” ➤ “changing temperatures and patterns of rainfall are expected to alter the geographical distribution of insect vectors that spread infectious diseases. Of these diseases, malaria and dengue are of greatest public health concern.”

Not	only	do	these	pose	challenges	for	health	systems	in	terms	 of	delivery	of	care,	but	they	also	demand	greater	vigilance	 and	 greater	 effort	 in	 relation	 to	 surveillance	 of	 infectious	 diseases,	for	example.	 At	 the	 local	 level,	 the	 most	 outstanding	 contribution	 to	 providing	an	evidence	base	for	health	systems	interventions	 was	 provided	 by	 the	 South	 African	 National	 Burden	 of	 Disease	 (SA	 NBD)	 study	 [Comparative	 Risk	 Assessment].	 Based	on	the	underlying	causes	of	premature	mortality	and	 morbidity	experienced	in	South	Africa	in	2000,	a	comparative	 risk	 assessment	 (CRA)	 was	 conducted	 to	 estimate	 the	 contribution	made	by	selected	risk	factors.	The	intent	of	the	 exercise	–	placing	“more emphasis on preventing disease and injury and on the causal determinants of health”	–	is	entirely	 congruent	 with	 the	 PHC	 approach.	 The	 key	 findings	 are	 summarised	in	tables	1	and	2,	showing	the	contribution	of	 the	17	selected	risk	factors	to	burden	of	disease	(as	at	2000),	 with	the	burden	of	disease	expressed	in	terms	of	deaths	and	 disability-adjusted	life	years	(DALYs).

This	 analysis	 was	 then	 the	 basis	 for	 a	 prioritised	 list	 of	 interventions	 for	 the	 most	 important	 attributable	 causes	 to	 the	 burden	 of	 disease.	 For	 example,	 to	 address	 sexually	 transmitted	infection	(STI),	attributed	to	unsafe	sex	practices,	 the	recommendations	were	to: ➤	 strengthen	 the	 prevention	 of	 mother-to-child	 transmission	 (PMTCT)	 programme,	 and	 improve	 antenatal	screening	for	syphilis; ➤	 strengthen	population-based	interventions	that	target	 risky	sexual	behaviour,	particularly	among	youth; ➤	 ➤	 maintain	promotion	and	distribution	of	condoms;	 promote	 voluntary	 counselling	 and	 testing	 and	 provider-initiated	testing	and	counselling	for	HIV;	 ➤	 strengthen	 STI	 control	 by	 promoting	 syndromic	 management,	including	the	private	sector	(and	review	 guideline); ➤	 strengthen	screening	for	cervical	cancer,	and	promote	 regular	utilisation	of	screening	services;	 ➤	 ➤	 consider	the	promotion	of	male	circumcision;	 improve	access	to	highly	active	antiretroviral	treatment,	 placing	 particular	 emphasis	 on	 the	 current	 lack	 of	 human	resources	and	infrastructure;	 ➤	 improve	access	to	cotrimoxazole	in	adults	and	children	 with	HIV;	 ➤	 support	 research	 into	 microbicide	 and	 vaccine	 development;	and

➤	

better	understand	underlying	determinants	to	develop	 more	effective	interventions.

Apart	from	the	implications	for	research	and	for	programme	 planning,	 such	 recommendations	 should	 also	 shape	 data	 collection,	 interpretation	 and	 reporting	 across	 the	 health	 system.	

Data sources and collection
An	overview	of	issues	to	consider	with	health	statistics	and	 data	 sources,	 based	 primarily	 on	 a	 series	 published	 in	 The	 Lancet	in	2007,	were	included	in	the	chapter	last	year	[SAHR	 2007	Ch15].	The	reader	is	reminded	to	be	cautious	of	what	 types	 of	 indicators	 are	 presented	 and	 whether	 their	 use	 is	 suitable	 for	 the	 intended	 purpose;	 the	 following	 text	 from	 World	Health	Statistics	2007	summarises	this	challenge:	“For monitoring, it is important to distinguish between corrected and predicted statistics. Corrected statistics use adjustments made for known biases and, if needed, are based on a systematic reconciliation of data from multiple sources using established, transparent methods. Predicted statistics use a set of assumptions about the association between other factors and the quantity of interest … to fill gaps in the data over time (projecting into the present or future) or space (from one population with data to another with limited or no data). Predicted statistics are not suitable for monitoring progress.”	[World	Health	Statistics	2007].

Available	routine	data	for	this	chapter	are	largely	determined	 by	the	application	of	South	Africa’s	National	Indicator	Data	 Set	 (NIDS).	 The	 list	 of	 indicators	 and	 their	 definitions	 was	 included	 in	 the	 2005	 South	 African	 Health	 Review	 [SAHR	 2005	 Ch17].	 The	 ability	 to	 provide	 updated	 data	 from	 the	 District	Health	Information	System	(DHIS)	has,	unfortunately,	 been	adversely	impacted	upon	by	withdrawal	of	support	for	 the	existing	system.	Up-to-date	data	on	notifiable	diseases	 other	 than	 malaria	 and	 tuberculosis	 (TB),	 which	 have	 their	 own	 reporting	 systems,	 have	 also	 been	 elusive.	 However,	 even	data	from	these	two	reporting	systems	may	be	affected	 by	under-reporting	and	should	be	interpreted	with	caution.	 However	complete	the	data	on	patients	receiving	treatment	 is,	for	example,	the	reporting	system	cannot	provide	data	on	 the	number	of	patients	infected	but	not	yet	diagnosed	with	 TB.	Fortunately	many	other	data	sources	have	improved	and	 expanded,	with	Statistics	South	Africa	(StatsSA)	in	particular	 providing	interactive	online	access	to	some	key	data	sources.	 Although	not	new	data	per	se,	the	final	report	on	the	2003	 South	Africa	Demographic	and	Health	 Survey	(SADHS)	was	 released	in	July	2008	[SADHS	2003].	Previous	chapters	had	 reported	 some	 data	 from	 the	 Preliminary	 Report.	 These	 have,	 where	 possible,	 been	 updated	 to	 reflect	 the	 data	 in	 the	final	version.	 Reference	sources	in	the	text	are	indicated	by	the	use	of	a	 short	name	for	the	reference,	enclosed	in	square	brackets	 e.g.	 [StatsSA	 Mid-year	 Estimates].	 For	 the	 data	 tables,	 the	 short	 name	 of	 the	 reference	 /	 source	 is	 given	 in	 the	 footnotes	to	each	table,	together	with	any	specific	notes	 about	the	section	of	the	reference	used	or	the	data	itself.	 At	the	end	of	the	chapter,	full	details	of	each	reference	are	 provided,	ordered	by	the	short	names	used.	Where	possible,	 the	means	to	access	the	complete	data	electronically	are	 provided.	Specific	Universal	Resource	Locators	(URLs)	are	 not	always	available	for	a	single	document.	In	such	cases,	 the	 location	 of	 the	 issuing	 authority’s	 website	 has	 been	 provided	(e.g.	Statistics	SA	can	be	accessed	at	http://www. statssa.gov.za). As	 before,	 this	 chapter	 has	 sought	 to	 provide	 data	 disaggregated	 by	 province	 and	 ethnic	 group.	 Providing	 data	 by	 health	 district	 is	 still	 complicated	 by	 unresolved	 cross-boundary	districts	and	some	systems	which	still	store	 data	according	to	the	old	demarcation.	The	data	have	been	 presented	 according	 to	 the	 new	 demarcation,	 and	 any	 data	being	reported	for	cross-boundary	districts	have	been	 aggregated	 and	 included	 in	 the	 province	 that	 the	 district	 is	 located	 in	 according	 to	 the	 latest	 boundaries	 from	 the	 Municipal	Demarcation	Board.	

Although	 the	 national	 Department	 of	 Health	 (NDoH)	 disseminates	 very	 little	 data	 at	 a	 level	 of	 disaggregation	 relevant	 to	 the	 District	 Health	 System	 (and	 hence	 to	 assessment	 of	 the	 implementation	 of	 the	 PHC	 approach),	 some	provinces	are	producing	well	structured	annual	reports	 or	performance	plans	which	reflect	results	at	the	district	level	 and	according	to	the	gazetted	Budget	Programmes,	so	that	 both	resourcing	and	outcomes	can	be	judged	according	to	 the	level	of	care.	Disaggregation	of	socio-economic	data	is	 important	because	national	averages	often	mask	differences	 within	 and	 across	 subgroups.	 For	 policy	 purposes	 it	 is	 especially	relevant	to	understand	why	unfair	and	avoidable	 inequalities	 (or	 inequities)	 exist	 and	 what	 actions	 may	 be	 taken	 to	 improve	 equity.	 Describing	 health	 inequities	 and	 understanding	 their	 determinants	 require	 process	 and	 outcome	data	that	can	be	disaggregated	by	different	socioeconomic	 or	 demographic	 characteristics,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 ability	to	link	data	from	different	sectors	in	a	country	[World	 Heath	Statistics	2007].

Demographic indicators
The	largest	survey	undertaken	by	StatsSA	is	the	Community	 Survey	 [Community	 Survey	 2007].	 The	 2007	 Community	 Survey	 was	 based	 on	 a	 sample	 of	 274	 348	 dwelling	 units	 across	 all	 nine	 provinces,	 with	 a	 response	 rate	 of	 93.9%.	 The	 Community	 Survey	 collected	 data	 on	 population	 dynamics,	 disability	 and	 social	 grants,	 school	 attendance	 and	 educational	 attainment,	 the	 labour	 force	 and	 income.	 As	 such	 it	 represents	 an	 alternative	 source	 of	 population	 data,	which	can	be	contrasted	with	the	population	estimates	 based	on	adjustments	of	the	last	Census	(2001).	According	 to	the	 Community	 Survey,	 the	 national	population	 in	2007	 was	 48.5	 million,	 with	 the	 highest	 provincial	 populations	 being	those	of	GP	(10.5	million)	and	KZN	(10.3	million).	The	 Community	 Survey	 also	 provides	 estimates	 of	 increases	 in	 population,	 with	 the	 more	 urban	 provinces	 of	 WC	 and	 GP	 showing	 the	 greatest	 increases	 since	 2001,	 at	 16.7%	 and	 13.9%	 respectively.	 These	 two	 provinces	 would	 thus	 seem	 to	be	the	major	recipients	of	migrants	from	other	provinces.	 Such	population	shifts	have	major	implications	for	demands	 on	 health	 services,	 and	 also	 need	 to	 be	 reflected	 in	 the	 equitable	share	formulae	used	to	allocate	monies	from	the	 national	fiscus	to	provincial	Treasuries.	A	particular	problem	 has	 been	 encountered	 with	 estimates	 of	 the	 number	 of	 children.	 The	 Community	 Survey	 has	 confirmed	 that	 the	 number	of	children	was	under-estimated	in	both	the	previous	 censuses.	This	complicates	the	depiction	of	data	trends	over	 time,	 as	 changes	 may	 be	 due	 to	 data	 quality	 issues	 and	 not	 only	 population	 change.	 The	 Community	 Survey	 also	 shows	substantial	differences	in	the	 populations	of	certain	 municipalities,	 compared	 to	 the	 mid-year	 estimates	 from	 1995	to	2009,	which	are	used	by	the	Department	of	Health	 (DoH)	as	denominators.	These	differences	can,	at	times,	have	 substantial	 effects	 on	 a	 range	 of	 indicators	 that	 use	 such	 denominators.	 StatsSA	 released	 the	 mid-2008	 population	 estimates	 in	 July	 2008,	 incorporating	 new	 information	 from	the	Community	Survey	2007.	On	the	basis	of	this	they	 have	 also	 released	 a	 revised	 time	 series	 of	 provincial	 level	 population	estimates	from	2001	to	2008,	since	growth	rates	 for	some	areas	appear	to	be	quite	different	to	those	previously	 used,	and	for	any	time	series	indicators	it	is	important	to	use	 a	 set	 of	 estimates	 that	 change	 smoothly.	 Since	 previously	 published	estimates	have	been	used	as	the	denominators	for	 several	other	indicators,	they	have	also	been	included	in	the	 tables	provided	in	this	chapter. Another	 source	 of	 in-depth	 data,	 albeit	 on	 a	 limited	 population,	 is	 provided	 by	 the	 Demographic	 Surveillance	 Sites	(DSS).	One	of	these,	the	Agincourt	DSS,	was	highlighted	 in	a	special	theme	issue	of	the	Scandinavian	Journal	of	Public	 Health	in	2007	[Scand	J	Public	Health	Suppl	69:(8-20)].	Table	5	 Focused	data	from	a	relatively	small	site	can	provide	detailed	 insights.	 For	 example,	 data	 from	 Agincourt	 has	 shown	 how	 increasing	 numbers	 of	 migrants	 who	 fall	 ill	 in	 urban	 areas	 return	 to	 the	 rural	 areas,	 where	 their	 families	 live.	 Such	patterns	of	migration	have	major	implications	for	the	 burden	and	complexity	of	disease	faced	by	under-resourced	 rural	 health	 services.	 Disease-specific	 insights	 are	 also	 provided.	For	example,	at	Agincourt,	approximately	43%	of	 the	population	aged	35	years	and	over	had	some	degree	of	 hypertension	in	2002/03. shows	 some	 major	 time	 trends	 from	 the	 Agincourt	 DSS	 (located	in	rural	district	in	MP),	comparing	data	from	1992/93	 and	2003/04.	In	the	editorial,	Tollman	and	Kahn	argued	that	 South	 Africa	 faced	 a	“crisis of evidence”,	 in	 that	 there	 was	 “limited availability of empirically-derived population-based data, weak investments to support their production, and limited public sector capacity to absorb, sift, interpret and respond to findings”.	 The	 papers	 presented	 in	 this	 theme	 issue	 provided	 confirmatory	 data,	 based	 on	 rigorous	 and	 detailed	 collection,	 of	 a	 number	 of	 nationally-described	 trends,	 such	 as	 increasing	 mortality	 in	 children	 and	 young	 adults,	 declining	 fertility	 and	 increasing	 migration.	 The	 Community	 Survey	 reported	 an	 observed	 crude	 death	 rate	 of	14.3	per	1	000	population,	which	confirms	the	estimates	 from	 the	 vital	 registration	 system	 (adjusted	 for	 estimated	 under-reporting).	 As	 shown	 in	 Table	 5,	 the	 Agincourt	 DSS	 also	reported	a	substantial	increase	in	overall	mortality	over	 time.

Socio-economic indicators
A	health	system	purporting	to	be	based	on	the	PHC	approach	 must	 pay	 close	 attention	 to	 socio-economic	 indicators,	 as	 they	 measure	 some	 of	 the	 most	 important	 determinants	 of	 health.	 Comprehensive	 PHC	 demands	 an	 intersectoral	 approach	to	tackling	these	challenges. A	composite	measure	of	such	determinants	of	health	is	the	 deprivation	 index,	 which	 can	 be	 estimated	 from	 the	 data	 collected	 in	 the	 Community	 Survey.	 Areas	 that	 fall	 into	 socio-economic	quintile	1	(SEQ	1)	are	most	deprived,	while	 those	 that	 fall	 into	 SEQ	 5	 are	 the	 least	 deprived	 (best	 off)	 [Deprivation	 Index	 2007	 subdist].	 Map	 1	 shows	 the	 health	 sub-districts,	 depicted	 per	 socio-economic	 quintile,	 based	 on	the	Community	Survey	2007.	 A	 PHC	 approach	 would	 also	 mandate	 a	 specific	 focus	 on	 the	 socio-economic	 condition	 of	 children.	 In	 2007,	 the	 Human	 Sciences	 Research	 Council	 (HSRC)	 published	 a	 comprehensive	 report	 entitled	 ‘The	 South	 African	 Index	 of	 Multiple	Deprivation	for	Children:	Census	2001’.	While	based	 on	 data	 from	 the	 last	 Census	 (10%	 sample),	 it	 nonetheless	 offers	 fresh	 insights	 and	 hard	 data	 about	 the	 plight	 of	 children	in	South	Africa.	The	child-focused	deprivation	index	 is	based	on	five	domains	and	detailed	maps	are	included	in	 the	publication: ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 income	and	material	deprivation; employment	deprivation; education	deprivation; adequate	care	deprivation;	and living	environment	deprivation. water	or	lack	of	sanitation,	of	which	66.4%	were	in	children	 under	 five	 years.	 Lack	 of	 access	 to	 water	 and	 sanitation	 is	 not	limited	to	households.	Data	from	2002	show	that	15%	 of	 clinics	 and	 nearly	 12%	 of	 schools	 in	 South	 Africa	 were	 without	 sanitation.	 Relative	 deprivation	 is	 also	 reflected	 in	 the	 choice	 of	 energy	 sources,	 with	 20%	 of	 South	 African	 households	exposed	to	indoor	smoke	from	solid	fuels.	 Socio-economic	 status	 is	 also	 reflected	 in	 levels	 of	 school	 attendance	 and	 the	 degree	 of	 educational	 attainment,	 elements	 that	 are	 measured	 in	 the	 Community	 Survey.	 Although	 figures	 for	 school	 attendance	 in	 the	 5-24	 year	 age	 group	 have	 shown	 improvement	 over	 time,	 disparities	 between	 ethnic	 groups	 remain	 stark.	 The	 percentage	 of	 persons	 over	 20	 years	 with	 no	 schooling	 at	 all	 has	 almost	 halved	from	1996	(19%)	to	2007	(10%).	 Improvements	 in	 socio-economic	 conditions	 can	 also	 be	 seen	in	the	increase	in	the	proportion	of	households	living	in	 formal	dwellings,	which	has	increased	from	64%	in	1996	to	 71%	in	2007	[Community	Survey	2007].	 In	keeping	with	the	focus	on	determinants	of	health,	there	 has	been	increased	attention	to	the	issue	of	access	to	safe	 drinking	water	and	sanitation	services.	A	joint	WHO	/	United	 Nations	 Children’s	 Fund	 (UNICEF)	 monitoring	 programme	 	 has	 been	 established	 to	 track	 progress	 towards	 the	 MDG	 target	 for	 drinking	 water	 and	 sanitation,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 Water	for	Life	Decade	2005-2015.	This	year,	2008,	has	been	 designated	 as	 the	 International	 Year	 of	 Sanitation.	 The	 2008	 progress	 report	 provided	 an	 assessment	 of	 global,	 regional	 and	 country	 progress,	 but	 using	 a	 new	 way	 of	 analysing	sanitation	practices	and	drinking	water	coverage.	 The	 ‘sanitation	 ladder’	 marks	 trends	 in	 using	 improved,	 shared	 and	 unimproved	 sanitation	 facilities	 and	 the	 trends	 in	 open	 defecation.	 Trends	 in	 drinking	 water	 coverage	 are	 disaggregated	 in	 a	 similar	 ‘drinking	 water	 ladder’,	 which	 shows	 the	 percentage	 of	 the	 world	 population	 that	 uses	 piped	 connections	 into	 a	 dwelling,	 plot	 or	 yard;	 other	 improved	water	sources;	and	unimproved	sources.	New	data	 were	 also	 presented	 on	 the	 time	 taken	 to	 collect	 drinking	 water.	The	data	show	the	proportion	of	people	that	spend	 more	 than	 30	 minutes	 on	 a	 single	 water-hauling	 trip	 and,	 as	 a	 consequence,	 likely	 to	 compromise	 their	 daily	 water	 consumption.	 Survey	 data	 on	 who	 usually	 fetches	 water	 were	also	presented.	[Progress	on	Water	and	Sanitation]	

The	 majority	 of	 municipalities	 in	 both	 the	 WC	 (24	 of	 25)	 and	 GP	 (10	 of	 12)	 are	 in	 the	 top	 quintile,	 that	 is	 the	 least	 deprived	 20%	 in	 terms	 of	 child	 deprivation.	 In	 the	 EC,	 all	 municipalities	 in	 the	 former	 Transkei	 fall	 into	 the	 bottom	 two	quintiles,	that	is	the	most	deprived	40%.	The	majority	 of	 these	 municipalities	 (22	 of	 39)	 are	 in	 the	 most	 deprived	 20%.	In	KZN	and	LP	the	majority	of	municipalities	are	also	in	 the	most	deprived	40%.	There	is	a	more	mixed	picture	in	the	 other	provinces.	 The	 comparative	 risk	 assessment	 (CRA)	 undertaken	 by	 the	 South	 African	 National	 Burden	 of	 Disease	 (SA	 NBD)	 study,	 based	 on	 2000	 data,	 showed	 that	 13	 434	 deaths	 were	 attributable	 to	 unsafe	 water	 and	 lack	 of	 sanitation	 and	 hygiene	 [Comparative	 Risk	 Assessment].	 These	 represented	 2.6%	of	all	deaths.	As	would	be	expected,	this	burden	was	 greatest	in	children	under	five	years,	accounting	for	9.3%	of	 all	deaths	in	this	age	group.	Put	more	specifically,	84%	of	all	 deaths	due	to	diarrhoea	were	estimated	to	be	due	to	unsafe

Although	in	general	national	averages	for	indicators	of	some	 socio-economic	 determinants	 of	 health	 in	 South	 Africa	 are	 slowly	 improving,	 assessment	 of	 data	 disaggregated	 to	 municipal	(sub-district)	level	shows	that	there	are	still	huge	 disparities	between	areas	(Figure	1).

Source:	 Community	Survey	2007. Key:		These	graphs	plot	the	values	of	the	indicator	for	each	municipality	 (sub-district)	according	to	province.	The	black	dot	represents	the	 median	of	the	values	for	municipalities	within	a	province.	The	box	 is	 drawn	 between	 the	 first	 and	 third	 quartiles	 of	 the	 values.	 The	 horizontal	lines	(the	‘whiskers’)	extend	to	at	most	1.5	times	the	box	 width	(the	interquartile	range)	from	either	or	both	ends	of	the	box.	 They	must	end	at	an	observed	value,	thus	connecting	all	the	values	 outside	 the	 box	 that	 are	 not	 more	 than	 1.5	 times	 the	 box	 width	 away	from	the	box.	Any	value	more	than	1.5	times	the	interquartile	 range	is	shown	by	a	diamond.

At	 a	 more	 disaggregated	 level,	 more	 subtle	 changes	 can	 be	 seen.	 For	 example,	 Figure	 2	 shows	 a	 breakdown	 of	 the	 types	 of	 sanitation	 and	 how	 this	 has	 changed	 between	 2001	 and	 2007	 for	 a	 selection	 of	 municipalities	 with	 the	 worst	sanitation	status.	In	most	cases	there	has	been	some	 improvement,	albeit	small,	in	the	most	deprived	areas.	In	the	 case	of	Nkandla	(KZN286)	the	level	of	sanitation	appears	to	 have	deteriorated,	although	at	this	level	of	disaggregation	it	 is	also	possible	that	changes	are	due	to	sampling	error.

Data	on	socio-economic	conditions	can	also	be	gleaned	from	 the	 annual	 General	 Household	 Surveys	 (GHS).	 As	 always,	 disaggregated	analyses	can	show	interprovincial	disparities.	 For	 example,	 the	 GHS	 2007	 showed	 that	 while	 progress	 has	 been	 made	 in	 reducing	 the	 percentage	 of	 households	 living	 in	 informal	 dwellings,	 this	 improvement	 was	 most	 notable	in	KZN,	MP	and	EC.	Conversely,	rapid	urbanisation	 contributed	 to	 increases	 in	 the	 percentages	 of	 households	 living	 in	 informal	 dwellings	 in	 some	 provinces,	 notably	 GP,	 WC	and	NW.	However	comparison	of	the	Census	2001	and	 Community	Survey	2007	data	shows	that	the	percentage	of	 households	living	in	informal	dwellings	only	increased	in	NW,	 illustrating	 the	 difficulties	 in	 drawing	 definite	 conclusions	 about	trends	from	survey	data.	

Important	insights	can	also	be	gained	from	the	Income	and	 Expenditure	 of	 Households	 Surveys	 (IES)	 issued	 by	 StatsSA	 [StatsSA	 IES	 2005].	 The	 most	 recent	 showed	 that	 real	 per	 capita	income	increased	in	all	income	deciles	between	2000	 and	2005/06.	Although	income	from	work	continued	to	be	the	 most	important	source,	grants	were	increasingly	important	 as	 a	 source	 of	 income	 in	 lower-income	 households.	 This	 report	 provides	 important	 data	 on	 household	 expenditure	 on	 health.	 In	 2005/06,	 expenditure	 on	 health	 accounted	 for	1.7%	to	household	consumption	expenditure,	excluding	 health	insurance	or	medical	scheme	subscriptions	(Figure	3).	 Of	 this,	 37.9%	 of	 health	 expenditure	 on	 private	 sector	 services	was	for	medical	services	(such	as	consultations	with	 general	practitioners,	specialists	and	traditional	healers)	and	 34.6%	was	for	pharmaceutical	products.

An	HST	report	on	the	impact	of	income	poverty	alleviation	 programmes	 over	 a	 15-year	 period	 was	 prepared	 for	 the	 Presidency	in	2008	[Poverty	Review].	While	noting	the	many	 methodological	challenges	inherent	in	this	field	(not	least	the	 definition	of	poverty	itself),	the	authors	suggested	that	data	 supported	 the	 contention	 that	 “income poverty worsened in the late 1990s only to improve marginally from the early 2000s”	(Figure	4).	 The	 authors	 also	 noted	 that	 “[d]espite an improvement in economic performance over the past fifteen years, South Africa’s problem of mass unemployment increased sharply in percentage terms from 1994 until 2002 from about 20% to 30%”. Despite	gains	in	the	past	five	years,	they	felt	that	 the “country is not on a path to achieving the Millennium Development Goals of halving the rate of unemployment by 2014”.

As	 noted	 by	 the	 IES,	 the	 evidence	 gathered	 by	 Friedman	 and	Bhengu	pointed	to	the	increasing	contribution	of	social	 grants	to	household	income.	Trends	over	time	in	terms	of	the	 numbers	of	grant	beneficiaries	are	shown	in	Figure	5. The	 Centre	 for	 Social	 Science	 Research	 (CSSR)	 working	 paper	 cited	 also	 made	 the	 point	 that	 the	 removal	 of	 racial	 constraints	 after	 1994	 had	 resulted	 in	 increasing	 levels	 of	 upward	 mobility	 among	 African	 people,	 both	 in	 terms	 of	 occupations	 and	 incomes.	 As	 a	 result,	 class	 differences	 within	 the	 African	 population	 were	 becoming	 more	 important	as	interracial	differences	declined.	These	changes	 are	obscured	by	any	reporting	on	the	basis	of	ethnicity	alone,	 while	reporting	on	the	basis	of	measures	of	income	(such	as	 living	standards	measures,	as	a	proxy	for	‘class’)	may	more	 accurately	 reflect	 the	 emerging	 fault	 lines	 in	 South	 African	 society	[Seekings	2007].

Provincial maps and sub-district tables
The	 maps	 and	 tables	 in	 the	 following	 pages	 represent	 a	 selection	 of	 available	 data	 per	 province.	 The	 district	 and	 sub-district	 boundaries	 are	 according	 to	 the	 new	 (2006)	 demarcations.	It	is	noted	that	not	all	functions	and	reporting	 within	the	DoH	have	been	realigned	to	the	new	boundaries,	 however	 wherever	 possible	 data	 have	 been	 aggregated	 according	 to	 the	 new	 structures.	 Data	 from	 DHIS	 for	 the	 Eastern	 Cape	 are	 aggregated	 according	 to	 Local	 Service	 Areas.	Data	have	been	obtained	from	a	variety	of	sources: ➤	 Municipal	 maps	 per	 province	 based	 on	 data	 from	 the	 Municipal	Demarcation	Board.	 ➤	 Table	of	health	facilities:	 -	 -	 ➤	 Private	 health	 facilities	 data	 from	 Wilbury	 and	 Claymore	database. Public	 sector	 facilities	 and	 useable	 public	 sector	 beds	from	DHIS. Table	of	demographic	and	socio-economic	indicators: -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 2001	 Population	 from	 StatsSA	 Census	 2001	 according	to	new	(2006)	demarcation. 2007	Population	from	StatsSA	Community	Survey	 2007. Mid-07	 Population	 from	 DoH	 time-series	 (as	 included	in	DHIS). 2007	 Socio-economic	 indicators	 calculated	 from	 StatsSA	Community	Survey	2007. 2007	 Deprivation	 Index	 and	 socio-economic	 quintiles	calculated	by	Health	Economic	Unit	from	 Community	Survey	2007	data. ➤	 Graphs	and	maps	of	selected	indicators	per	province: -	 -	 -	 -	 Community	Survey	2007. General	Household	Survey	2006. DoH	data	on	TB	incidence	and	antenatal	surveys	of	 HIV	prevalence. National	Treasury	expenditure	data. A	 further	 problem	 for	 data	 management	 is	 the	 continuing	 amendments	 to	 municipal	 boundaries	 and	 names,	 particularly	 as	 the	 Municipal	 Demarcation	 Board	 is	 finalising	 a	 number	of	changes	prior	to	the	upcoming	elections.	Some	 of	 the	 changes	 which	 will	 affect	 future	 data	 include	 the	 proposed	incorporation	of	Metsweding	into	Ekurhuleni	and	 Tshwane	and	the	removal	of	all	the	District	Managed	Areas.	 While	efforts	have	been	made	to	reflect	these	changes,	new	 data	 and	 map	 files	 were	 not	 yet	 available	 at	 the	 time	 of	 compiling	this	chapter. The	 deprivation	 index	 is	 a	 measure	 of	 relative	 deprivation	 across	districts	and	sub-districts	within	South	Africa,	and	is	a	 composite	measure	derived	from	a	set	of	variables.	Variables	 included	 in	 the	 analysis	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 indicators	 of	 material	 and	 social	 deprivation.	 The	 area	 that	 is	 least	 deprived	has	a	normalised	deprivation	index	of	1.	Areas	with	 higher	 values	 are	 relatively	 more	 deprived.	 The	 score	 itself	 does	not	have	any	intrinsic	meaning,	but	the	relative	scores	 show	which	areas	are	more	deprived	than	others	and	can	be	 used	to	rank	areas.	The	areas	thus	ranked	according	to	levels	 of	deprivation	can	be	categorised	into	quintiles.	Areas	that	 fall	into	socio-economic	quintile	1	(SEQ	1)	are	most	deprived,	 while	those	that	fall	into	SEQ	5	are	the	least	deprived	(best	 off)	[Deprivation	Index	2007	subdist].	

Two	sources	of	population	estimates	have	been	included,	to	 illustrate	the	importance	of	accurate	population	figures,	as	 these	form	the	denominators	for	many	indicators.	The	mid2007	estimate	is	from	a	time-series	(1995-2009)	developed	 for	the	NDoH	based	on	the	best	available	information	from	 Census	2001	and	mid-year	estimates.	The	other	estimates	for	 2007	 are	 from	 the	 Community	 Survey	 2007,	 and	 although	 these	estimates	are	more	likely	to	reflect	actual	changes	that	 have	occurred	due	to	migration	and	changes	in	fertility	and	 mortality,	 until	 a	 revised	 set	 of	 time-series	 estimates	 have	 been	 developed	 they	 cannot	 be	 used	 for	 any	 time-series	 indicators.

Mortality
Although	 estimates	 of	 crude	 mortality	 are	 reported	 as	 a	 basic	demographic	variable	in	the	section	above,	developing	 more	targeted	public	health	interventions	requires	far	more	 detailed	 data	 about	 what	 people	 die	 from,	 particularly	 if	 	 those	 deaths	 are	 premature.	 This	 demands	 a	 high	 level	 of	 accuracy	 in	 the	 completion	 and	 collation	 of	 death	 notification	 forms.	 As	 Groenewald	 and	 Pieterse	 put	 it	 in	 a	 2007	editorial	in	the	South	African	Medical	Journal	(SAMJ),	 “Medical doctors … know what caused the death of their patients, and by accurately sharing this knowledge on the death notification form, can assist in preventing future deaths”	 [SAMJ	 97(1056-8)].	 This	 editorial	 accompanied	 an	 article	 by	 Burger	 et	 al.	 which	 reported	 the	 frequency	 of	 errors	in	the	cause	of	death	sequence	and	the	completeness	 of	information	recorded	on	death	notification	forms	(DNFs)	 for	 all	 residents	 of	 two	 residential	 areas	 in	 the	 Cape	 Town	 metropole	 who	 died	 during	 the	 period	 1	 June	 2003	 to	 31	 May	 2004	 [SAMJ	 97(1077-81)].	 A	 total	 of	 844	 DNFs	 were	 evaluated	 and	 errors	 were	 found	 in	 91.7%	 (95%	 CI:	 89.793.4%)	of	DNFs.	At	least	one	major	error	(defined	as	“those that could affect the accurate coding of the underlying cause of death, including any of the following: (i) no acceptable cause of death in part 1; (ii) competing causes of death in part 1; (iii) immediate, intermediate and underlying causes Data	 from	 small,	 localised	 surveys	 can	 also	 help	 illuminate	 this	 topic.	 Mashego	 et	 al.	 reported	 on	 a	 cross-sectional	 survey	 in	 a	 rural	 area	 of	 KZN,	 between	 February	 and	 July	 2004,	 based	 on	 structured	 questionnaires	 and	 verbal	 autopsies	 [SAMJ	 97(587-92)].	 These	 data	 clearly	 indicated	 the	 high	 mortality	 rates	 being	 seen	 in	 many	 rural	 areas	 before	 access	 to	 antiretroviral	 treatment	 became	 available.	 An	overall	crude	death	rate	of	29	(95%	CI:	25-33)	deaths	per	 1	000	person-years	was	recorded,	with	the	highest	mortality	 rate	occurring	among	women	aged	30	to	34	years.	In	men,	 the	 highest	 mortality	 was	 in	 those	 aged	 35	 to	 39	 years	 and	 those	 over	 60.	 Of	 the	 185	 verbal	 autopsies	 reported,	 of death presented in an incorrect order (sequencing error); or (iv) mechanism of death not followed by a proper cause of death”)	were	detected	in	43.4%	(95%	CI:	40.1-46.7%).	The	 most	common	error	was	an	illogical	cause	of	death	sequence.	 While	this	study	considered	a	relatively	small	sample	of	DNFs	 from	a	single	urban	setting,	the	authors	nonetheless	felt	that	 their	results	had	“far-reaching implications for the reliability of mortality data in South Africa”.	 At	 the	 very	 least	 they	 provide	some	basis	for	the	critical	appreciation	of	any	trends	 seen	 over	 time,	 or	 small	 differences	 between	 geographical	 areas.

77	 (42%)	 deaths	 were	 attributed	 to	 AIDS	 and	 16	 (9%)	 to	 violence	or	accidents.	The	majority	of	deaths	resulted	from	 pulmonary	TB,	reported	in	44%	of	the	AIDS-related	deaths.	 As	 HIV	 and	 AIDS	 prevention	 and	 treatment	 improves,	 and	 greater	integration	with	TB	management	is	achieved,	it	will	 be	important	to	repeat	such	surveys	in	similar	settings. As	 in	 so	 many	 areas,	 the	 StatsSA	 Community	 Survey	 2007	 has	 provided	 new	 data	 on	 mortality	 as	 well.	 Respondents	 were	 asked	 to	 indicate	 whether	 the	 cause	 of	 death	 for	 all	 those	that	had	died	in	the	previous	twelve	months	(February	 2006	 to	 January	 2007)	 were	 due	 to	 unnatural	 or	 natural	 causes	 and	 to	 provide	 details	 on	 the	 age	 at	 death	 and	 the	 sex	 of	 the	 deceased.	 They	 reported	 that	 about	 15%	 of	 all	 deaths	 were	 due	 to	 unnatural	 causes.	 Not	 unsurprisingly,	
Table 9: Mortality indicators by province EC
Burden of disease analysis

more	 males	 (18.8%)	 were	 reportedly	 to	 have	 died	 from	 unnatural	 causes	 than	 females	 (10.1%).	 The	 percentage	 of	 deaths	noted	as	unnatural	was	highest	in	those	aged	15	to	 19	years,	accounting	for	42.4%	of	deaths	in	this	age	group.	 The	 crude	 death	 rate	 for	 2006	 was	 estimated	 at	 14.3	 per	 1	000	 population.	 Age	 specific	 mortality	 rates	 by	 sex	 were	 also	 provided.	 Although,	 at	 younger	 ages,	 there	 appears	 to	 be	 little	 differences	 in	 death	 rates	 between	 males	 and	 females,	 differences	 become	 evident	 later.	 It	 was	 reported	 that	 death	 rates	 in	 the	 age	 groups	 20-24	 to	 30-34	 were	 higher	 for	 females	 than	 for	 males.	 Male	 death	 rates	 were	 higher	than	female	death	rates	at	all	other	age	groups.	Agespecific	mortality	by	sex	is	shown	in	Figure	6,	taken	from	the	 Community	Survey	2007	report.

Disability
As	reported	in	the	Community	Survey	2007	report,	StatsSA	 defines	 disability	 as	 a	 “physical or mental handicap which has lasted for six months or more, or is expected to last at least six months, which prevents the person from carrying out daily activities independently, or from participating fully in educational, economic or social activities”.	 In	 the	 Community	 Survey,	 respondents	 were	 accordingly	 asked	 whether	they	were	affected	by	disabilities	related	to	sight,	 hearing,	 communication,	 physical,	 intellectual,	 mental	 and	 emotional	 state.	 These	 questions	 were	 also	 posed	 in	 the	 Census	2001,	but	not	in	the	Census	1996,	in	which	questions	 related	 to	 communication	 and	 emotional	 disabilities	 were	 not	 asked.	 The	 2007	 report	 outlined	 other	 methodological	 differences	in	detail: ➤	 “In Census 1996, respondents were asked to indicate whether or not there were any people with serious visual, hearing, physical or mental disabilities in the household. The seriousness of the disability was not clearly defined. Rather, the respondent’s perceptions of seriousness were relied on.” ➤	 ➤	 “In Census 2001, disability was defined as a physical or mental handicap which has lasted for six months or more, or was expected to last at least six months, which prevents the person from carrying out daily activities independently, or from participating fully in educational, economic or social activities.” “During the Community Survey 2007, the disability question was split into three distinct questions and respondents were asked whether they had any kind of disability; if they had, the type of disability; and the intensity of the disability (that is, whether the disability seriously prevents the person from full participation in life activities such as education, work, social life, etc.).” [Community	Survey	2007]. Notwithstanding	these	differences	in	methodology,	StatsSA	 reported	that	the	percentage	of	persons	with	disabilities	had	 decreased	from	6.5%	in	1996	to	4.0%	in	2007.

Infectious disease
The	 World	 Health	 Report	 2007	 noted	 that	 “inadequate investment in public health, resulting from a false sense of security in the absence of infectious disease outbreaks, has led to reduced vigilance and a relaxing of adherence to effective prevention programmes”.	 South	 Africa	 cannot	 be	 described	 as	 unaffected	 by	 infectious	 diseases,	 but	 the	 degree	 to	 which	 public	 health	 efforts	 are	 directed	 at	 the	 HIV	/	TB	 challenge	 is	 not	 at	 all	 matched	 by	 the	 effort	 expended	 in	 surveillance	 of	 other	 infectious	 diseases,	 including	 those	 designated	 as	 ‘notifiable’.	 Disappointingly,	 no	new	data	on	notifiable	diseases,	such	as	cholera,	rabies	 and	 tetanus,	 are	 available	 from	 the	 NDoH.	 An	 appropriate	 information	 management	 system	 for	 notifiable	 diseases	 is	 still	being	implemented.

Tuberculosis
The	 Global	 Tuberculosis	 Control	 2008	 report	 noted	 that	 “[t]reatment success rates in South Africa remain low, with death and default the most common negative outcomes” [Global	TB	Control	2008].	The	report	however	recorded	that	 the	70%	case	detection	rate	target	was	reached	for	the	first	 time	in	2006.	On	the	negative	side,	the	point	was	made	that,	 in	 2005	 at	 least,	 only	 one	 third	 of	 patients	 with	 TB	 were	 tested	for	HIV,	and	that	no	information	was	available	on	the	 proportion	tested	for	multi-drug	resistance. The	4th	Global	Report	on	‘Anti-tuberculosis	drug	resistance	 in	the	world’	was	also	released	in	2008	[MDR	TB	2008].	The	 press	 release	 highlighted	 data	 from	 South	 Africa,	 which	 showed	 that	 996	 (almost	 6%)	 of	 17	 615	 of	 the	 specimens	 collected	 that	 were	 multi-drug	 resistant	 (MDR)	 between	 2004	 and	 October	 2007	 met	 the	 definition	 for	 extensively	 drug	 resistant	 (XDR)	 TB.	 In	 KZN,	 656	 (14%)	 of	 4	 701	 MDR	 cases	 recorded	 in	 this	 time	 period	 were	 XDR-TB.	 The	 press	 release	also	noted	the	link	between	HIV	infection	and	MDRTB,	commenting	that	in	South	Africa	alone,	44%	of	TB	patients	 were	estimated	to	be	co-infected	with	HIV.	Globally,	it	was	 estimated	that	nearly	5%	of	new	TB	cases	were	MDR-TB.	The	 highest	rates	of	MDR-TB	were	recorded	in	Azerbaijan,	where	 nearly	a	quarter	of	all	TB	cases	in	the	capital	were	MDR-TB. As	 always,	 the	 in-depth	 data	 that	 can	 be	 gathered	 in	 a	 Demographic	 Surveillance	 Site	 can	 provide	 important	 insights.	 Data	 from	 the	 Agincourt	 DSS	 from	 1999	 were	 reported	in	the	theme	issue	of	the	Scandinavian	Journal	of	 Public	Health	[Scand	J	Public	Health	Suppl	69:(8-20)].	During	 1999,	 data	 on	 TB	 prevalence	 were	 obtained	 from	 three	 different	sources.	These	were	the	hospital	register	(reflecting	 passive	case-finding),	a	systematic	household	assessment	of	 chronic	 coughers	 (active	 case	 finding)	 and	 verbal	 autopsy.	 A	total	of	38	251	permanent	adult	residents	were	included	 in	the	analysis.	Through	passive	case	finding,	a	total	of	102	 cases	of	pulmonary	TB	(PTB)	were	detected.	The	active	case	 finding	 sweep	 detected	 366	 chronic	 coughers,	 with	 six	 confirmed	as	PTB.	Of	the	28	PTB	deaths	detected	by	verbal	 autopsy,	13	had	not	previously	been	identified	by	the	health	 service.	The	total	PTB	prevalence	was	thus	estimated	at	157	 per	 100	 000	 population,	 but	 only	 110	 per	 100	 000	 (about	 70%)	were	detected	by	passive	case	finding.	Of	the	balance,	 about	 half	 were	 undiagnosed	 in	 the	 community	 and	 half	 died	of	PTB	prior	to	diagnosis.	Of	note,	nearly	90%	of	those	 detected	 through	 active	 case	 finding	 and	 verbal	 autopsy	 had	previously	sought	treatment	in	the	health	service,	and	 further,	it	was	noted	that	‘most’	had	done	so	on	‘a	number	 of	 occasions’.	 The	 conclusion	 reached,	 which	 would	 in	 many	cases	be	as	valid	today	as	it	was	when	the	study	was	 conducted	 (in	 1999),	 was	 that	 “while issues of transport, distance, culture and use of non-Western health care may be barriers, interventions to improve the quality of the health system to facilitate early TB diagnosis remain paramount”. The	challenges	of	measuring	TB	burden,	trends	over	time	and	 the	impact	of	control	programmes	were	reviewed	by	Dye	et	 al.	in	the	Lancet	Infectious	Diseases	Journal	in	2008	[Lancet	 Inf	8(233-43)].	This	useful	publication	reviewed	the	relative	 strengths	and	limitations	of	measures	of	disease	incidence,	 disease	 and	 infection	 prevalence,	 and	 TB	 mortality.	 It	 concluded	that	“[b]y 2015, every country should be able to assess progress in tuberculosis control by estimating the time trend in incidence, and the magnitude of reductions in either prevalence or death”.	It	was	pointed	out	that	in	a	system	that	 relied	on	tracking	of	outcomes	in	directly	observed	treatment	 short-course	(DOTS)	cohorts,	deaths	during	treatment	which	 were	not	directly	attributable	to	TB,	would	nevertheless	be	 attributed	 to	 TB.	 The	 ‘bigger	 problem’,	 however,	 was	 the	 number	of	DOTS	cohort	members	for	whom	outcomes	were	 not	 known.	 Globally,	 it	 was	 estimated	 that	 the	 treatment	 results	 of	 5.6	 million	 smear-positive,	 smear-negative,	 and	 extra-pulmonary	patients	were	not	known.	In	contrast,	only	 4.5	 million	 of	 8.9	 million	 new	 patients	 were	 recorded	 in	 DOTS	and	other	control	programmes	in	2004,	and	of	these,	 results	were	known	in	only	3.3	million	cases.	The	hope	was	 expressed	 that,	 ultimately,	 “DOTS cohorts should include nearly all tuberculosis cases arising in any country, so that cohort outcomes converge more closely with national death registrations”.	 The	 point	 was	 made	 that	 “convergence will never be complete unless the number of patients lost to follow-up (default, transfer) can be reduced to zero”.	What	 was	advocated	was	“linking and cross-referencing between patient cohorts and vital registration”,	in	which	“each case and death must be uniquely identified in the recording system”.	 This	 level	 of	 data	 linkage	 is	 not	 yet	 possible	 in	 South	Africa,	although	this	is	also	true	of	most	high-burden	 countries. The	point	is	often	made	that	South	Africa	produces	excellent	 policy	documents,	but	falls	somewhat	short	in	implementing	 these	 policies.	 The	 Draft	 Tuberculosis	 Strategic	 Plan	 for	 South	 Africa	 2007-2011	 is	 an	 extensive	 document	 and	 a	 useful	 source	 of	 data	 on	 the	 disease	 [TB	 Plan	 2007-2011].	 At	 times,	 there	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 lack	 of	 candour	 reflected	 in	 the	text.	For	example,	while	it	is	stated	that	“DOTS coverage reached 100% at the end of 2004”	 (followed	 by	 a	 caveat	 about	 MP	 being	 declared	 a	 ‘non-DOTS	 province’	 in	 2005),	 a	 later	 paragraph	 states	 that	 “all DOTS components show major quality deficiencies that require urgent improvement”.	 Examples	provided	make	depressing	reading:

commenting	on	the	smear	conversion	rates	for	2006,	it	 is	noted	that	“close on one in three patients (28%) do not have results available”	(with	MP,	EC,	KZN	and	NC	at	 more	than	35%);

2006/07	 year,	 211	 sub-districts	 were	 implementing	 TB	 and	 HIV	activities.	It	was	claimed	that	58%	of	TB	patients	were	 offered	 HIV	 counselling	 and	 testing	 and	 that	 68%	 agreed	 to	be	tested.	Conversely,	‘systematic	TB	screening’	amongst	 people	living	with	HIV	had	been	‘low’,	but	it	was	reported	 that	29%	of	the	HIV	patients	screened	were	found	to	have	 TB	disease.	It	was	also	noted	that	the	TB	preventive	therapy	 policy	 was	 “not implemented widely at this stage and the reasons for this will be investigated further this year”. The	 following	 targets	 and	 indicators	 were	 included	 in	 the	 Draft	Plan:
Main Indicators with proposed targets to be reached by 2011 Case detection rate Cure Rate Treatment Success rate 70% 85% >85%

➤	

while	 death	 and	 defaulter	 rates	 during	 the	 intensive	 phase	 are	 described	 as	 ‘low’	 (1.7-5.7%	 and	 1-3.4%	 respectively),	it	is	noted	that	7%	of	patients	remained	 smear	 positive	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 intensive	 phase	 (and	 thus	likely	to	have	drug-resistant	disease);

➤	

in	 particular,	 since	 this	 high	 positivity	 rate	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 intensive	 phase	 does	 not	 correlate	 with	 the	 reported	low	failure	rate	at	the	end	of	treatment,	this	 casts	doubt	on	the	“quality of the laboratory results or the quality of data”.

The	 ‘major	 deficiencies’	 identified	 in	 the	 draft	 plan	 relate	 to	 the	 quantity	 and	 quality	 of	 human	 resources,	 TB-HIV	 collaboration,	 access	 to	 diagnostic	 services	 and	 the	 proper	 use	of	the	reporting	and	recording	system. The	draft	plan	is	most	useful	for	the	candid	appraisal	of	MDR-	 and	 XDR-TB	 data.	 It	 provides	 a	 table	 showing	 the	 number	 of	 identified	 MDR-TB	 cases	 per	 province	 in	 2004	 to	 2006,	 and	the	first	quarter	of	2007.	For	the	whole	country,	these	 show	a	steady	increase	from	3	278	cases	in	2004	to	6	716	 cases	in	2006,	and	2	140	cases	in	the	first	quarter	of	2007	 only.	The	draft	plan,	however,	notes	that	36%	of	these	were	 reported	in	only	one	province,	WC.	The	point	is	made	that	 “this province has arguably the best TB control programme in the country”,	but	also	that	the	proportion	of	MDR	cases	 has	 remained	 “fairly constant at 2.6%”.	 The	 explanation	 offered	is	that	the	WC	“has a higher degree of suspicion of MDR-TB and that it is being relatively under-diagnosed in other provinces”.	In	contrast,	it	is	noted	that	MP,	“where the TB control programme has not been functioning optimally”,	 has	 seen	 a	 decrease	 in	 the	 proportion	 of	 MDR-TB	 over	 the	 same	 time	 period	 (from	 1.99%	 to	 0.7%).	 The	 most	 likely	 explanation	 is	 that	 “many patients with MDR-TB are not being diagnosed”. Time	trends	in	relation	to	XDR-TB	are	also	provided,	but	these	 are	 even	 more	 difficult	 to	 interpret.	 The	 cases	 noted	 were	 retrospectively	diagnosed	on	the	basis	of	laboratory	records.	 A	total	of	898	cases	were	noted	from	2004	until	the	end	of	 the	first	quarter	of	2007,	but	221	of	these	were	detected	in	 that	last	quarter	alone.	KZN	accounted	for	65%	of	all	XDR-TB	 cases,	but	again,	the	best	that	could	be	said	of	MP	and	LP	 was	 that	 their	 figures	 represented	 “gross under detection because of poor access to the culture and DST services”. Some	 data	 on	 the	 integration	 of	 TB	 and	 HIV	 services	 were	 also	 presented.	 It	 was	 reported	 that,	 by	 the	 end	 of	 the

Annexure	D	to	the	Draft	Plan	is	labelled	as	the	‘Framework’.	 In	 addition	 to	 the	 targets	 mentioned	 above,	 one	 of	 the	 specific	 objectives	 listed	 is	 “to reduce the death rates as a result of TB”.	 The	 ‘objectively	 verifiable	 indicator’	 stated	 is	 that	there	would	be	a	“reduction in death rates from 71 to 60 per 100 000 by 2011”.	 The	 Global	 Tuberculosis	 Control	 2008	country	profile	for	South	Africa,	however,	records	the	 2006	 death	 rate	 as	 218	 per	 100	 000	 population.	 Based	 on	 the	 StatsSA	 cause	 of	 death	 data	 (not	 adjusted	 for	 underreporting),	 the	 death	 rate	 due	 to	 TB	 in	 2005	 was	 158	 per	 100	000	population.	There	are	differences	in	the	definition	 of	 ‘death	 due	 to	 TB’	 used	 in	 vital	 registration	 and	 the	 TB	 programme,	but	the	baseline	figure	for	the	Draft	Plan	seems	 questionable.

Malaria
The	2007	South	African	Health	Review	(SAHR)	chapter	noted	 the	apparent	mismatch	between	malaria	deaths	recorded	in	 the	notifiable	disease	system	and	those	reported	by	StatsSA	 in	 their	 cause	 of	 death	 reports	 based	 on	 vital	 registration.	 In	 particular,	 the	 existence	 of	 deaths	 recorded	 on	 death	 notification	forms	as	due	to	malaria	in	provinces	other	than	 KZN,	 MP	 and	 LP	 was	 noted.	 Marked	 differences	 were	 also	 noted	in	the	figures	for	LP,	from	these	two	sources.	Getting	 to	the	bottom	of	this	apparent	paradox	is	not	easy.	Although	 the	vital	registration	system	reflects	a	substantial	number	of	 deaths	due	to	malaria	in	other	provinces,	it	was	noted	that	a	 number	of	the	deaths	recorded	in	EC	and	WC,	for	example,	 gave	 the	 province	 of	 residence	 as	 LP.	 Misclassification	 of	 non-malarial	 deaths	 to	 malaria	 may	 have	 occurred	 in	 the	 vital	registration	system,	if	the	diagnosis	was	clinical	rather	 than	 based	 on	 a	 laboratory	 test.	 However,	 it	 is	 also	 likely	 that	the	notifiable	disease	system	is	missing	some	data,	to	 a	 greater	 extent	 outside	 of	 the	 three	 traditional	 malariaaffected	 provinces	 [Malaria	 Report	 2007].	 In	 contrast	 to	 countries	with	stable	transmission	of	malaria	where	children	 under	five	and	pregnant	women	are	at	greatest	risk	of	severe	 malaria,	 neither	 the	 notification	 nor	 the	 vital	 registration	 data	 indicate	 a	 high	 proportion	 of	 deaths	 among	 children	 under	 five	 years,	 since	 all	 age	 groups	 have	 a	 high	 risk	 of	 malaria	due	to	low	levels	of	acquired	immunity. The	 NDoH’s	 notifiable	 disease	 recording	 system	 shows	 malaria	cases	and	deaths	in	the	three	affected	provinces,	up	 to	the	end	of	March	2008.	A	more	detailed	analysis	of	the	 data	from	LP,	from	1998	to	2007,	was	presented	at	the	Public	 Health	 Association	 of	 South	 Africa	 (PHASA)	 Conference	 in	 2008	 [PHASA	 2008	 L025].	 Malaria	 incidence	 rates	 in	 LP	 showed	a	statistically	significant	decreasing	trend	from	the	 1998/99	 (173	 per	 100	 000	 person-years)	 to	 the	 2006/07	 season	(51	per	100	000	person-years),	while	the	case	fatality	 rate	 remained	 fairly	 stable	 over	 the	 whole	 period	 (a	 mean	 of	 1.1%	 per	 season).	 Incidence	 was	 reported	 to	 be	 lowest	 in	the	0-4	year	olds,	gradually	increasing	to	a	peak	at	30-39	 years,	then	gradually	decreasing.	While	at	first	this	may	seem	 incongruous,	it	was	argued	that	children	in	the	0-4	year	age	 group	were	more	likely	to	be	indoors	at	night,	and	thus	likely	 to	benefit	from	indoor	house	spraying.	In	contrast,	the	case	 fatality	 rate	 was	 shown	 to	 increase	 with	 increasing	 age.	 Data	were	also	provided	for	the	six	districts	in	LP.	Incidence	 was	highest	in	Vhembe	(adjoining	Zimbabwe),	followed	by	 Mopani	 and	 Bohlabela.	 However,	 the	 case	 fatality	 rate	 in	 Capricorn	 was	 high	 (3.4%)	 compared	 to	 that	 of	 the	 other	 districts.	This	could	be	explained	by	either	late	presentation	 and	/	or	delayed	or	inaccurate	diagnosis	and	/	or	treatment.	 ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 The	following	steps	are	taken	to	ensure	the	greatest	possible	 accuracy	 in	 malaria	 notifications	 in	 the	 three	 provinces	 in	 which	malaria	programmes	are	operated: ➤	 health	 facilities	 in	 the	 malaria	 risk	 areas	 are	 visited	 weekly,	and	in	some	cases	daily; each	case	in	followed	up	by	malaria	teams; for	each	malaria	death	that	is	notified,	a	full	mortality	 review	is	done; malaria	 cases	 are	 only	 captured	 if	 they	 are	 smear	 or	 rapid	test	positive	(patients	treated	for	malaria,	based	 on	a	clinical	diagnosis,	despite	negative	test	results,	are	 excluded); deaths	 noted	 as	 due	 to	 malaria	 based	 on	 a	 clinical	 diagnosis,	 but	 in	 which	 test	 results	 are	 negative,	 are	 also	excluded;	and while	compliance	by	private	general	practitioners	may	 be	lower,	close	collaboration	is	maintained	with	private	 hospitals	 in	 the	 risk	 areas	 (Kruger	 P	 2008,	 personal	 communication). The	 SADHS	 2003	 also	 seems	 to	 confirm	 that	 patients	 with	 malaria	are	more	widespread	than	generally	acknowledged;	 “When women were asked about malaria during pregnancy, 17 report that they had this illness during their last pregnancy (0.8 percent of women who have ever been pregnant). Interestingly, the women who report having malaria came from across all the provinces, except Mpumalanga.”	Although	 based	 on	 patient	 recall,	 the	 variability	 in	 management	 of	 malaria	suggests	that	treatment	guidelines	may	not	be	well	 known	throughout	the	country;	“Of the 2 088 women who had ever been pregnant, 27 women were unsure whether they had taken an antimalarial drug during pregnancy. However, 22 report that they had taken such medication; three took Daramal, three took Mirquin, three took Doximal, three took Plasmoquine and a further 12 took a medication but could not remember the name.”	[SADHS	2003]. The	SADHS	2003	also	provided	some	data	on	the	prevention	 measures	taken	by	households.	Of	the	3	005	households	surveyed	in	KZN,	MP	and	LP,	only	17	reported	owning	bed	nets.	 In	13	of	these	households,	there	was	only	a	single	bed	net	 and	nine	reported	that	the	nets	were	not	in	use	at	the	time	of	 the	survey.	Of	those	households	that	had	been	sprayed,	the	 majority	(82%)	had	been	sprayed	by	a	government	official.	 Where	other	measures	were	taken,	these	included	the	use	of	 mosquito	coils	and	repellents.	 Two	 publications	 have	 provided	 useful	 summaries	 of	 the	 history	 of	 malaria	 interventions	 and	 the	 challenges	 that	 are	still	faced.	Blumberg	and	Frean	included	some	data	on

malaria	 presentation	 in	 returning	 travellers,	 noting	 that	 this	 was	 “an increasing and significant problem”.	 Citing	 unpublished	 data	 from	 GP,	 they	 noted	 “a significant delay in presentation to health practitioners, a higher mortality than in the traditional transmission malaria areas with established malaria control programmes, and a definite need for health promotion to advise travellers on prevention of malaria”.	 They	 also	 reported	 46	 cases	 of	 Odyssean	 malaria	 in	GP	between	1996	and	2004	(presumably	“transmitted by mosquitoes imported in various forms of transport including suitcases, mini-buses and aeroplanes”)	 [SAMJ	 97(11937)].	An	SAMJ	news	piece	recently	reported	on	the	van	den	 Ende	 Memorial	 Lecture	 delivered	 at	 the	 University	 of	 Cape	 Town	 [SAMJ	 98(17-8)].	 In	 her	 comments	 on	 the	 ‘shifting	 provincial	differences’,	Professor	Karen	Barnes,	was	quoted	 as	 saying	 malaria	 control	 was	 ‘not	 as	 good’	 in	 the	 area	 of	 Mozambique	 bordering	 on	 MP	 and	 LP.

Africa,	LP	was	bearing	the	brunt	of	failing	malaria	control	in	 neighbouring	Zimbabwe.	Analysis	of	the	 probable	place	of	 infection	for	cases	reported	in	GP,	MP	and	KZN	showed	that	 the	 majority	 of	 cases	 were	 imported	 from	 Mozambique	 or	 Zimbabwe	[Malaria	Report	2007].	These	factors	may	explain	 some	of	the	differences	seen	in	malaria	notification	and	vital	 registration	data.	 Whatever	 the	 truth	 about	 the	 true	 burden	 of	 malaria	 in	 South	 Africa,	 the	 available	 data	 at	 least	 form	 the	 basis	 for	 comparison	 over	 time.	 It	 has	 been	 stated	 that	 the	 MDG	 for	 malaria	 (to	 “halt and begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases by the target date of 2015”,	 specifically	 to	 “reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by 75% by 2015 from the 2005 baseline level”	 (http://www. un.org/millenniumgoals/)	 is	 difficult	 to	 interpret	 and	 measure,	as	“for virtually all countries and the world, there is no baseline level”	[Am	J	Trop	Med	Hyg	77(36-47)].

HIV and AIDS
Just as debate on HIV and AIDS tends to dominate the political space, the related data tends to be available in a breadth and depth unmatched by other diseases. In his foreword to the 2008 Report on the global AIDS epidemic, Dr Peter Piot, UNAIDS Executive Director and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that “AIDS is a supremely complex issue that demands an unparalleled response from all sectors of society, worldwide. But as this report shows, it is increasingly evident that—given the will and given the resources—we can do it” [AIDS Global Report 2008]. The report notes that 2008 marks “the halfway mark between the 2001 UNGASSb Declaration of Commitment and the 2015 target for Millennium Development Goal 6, and only two years before the agreed target date for universal access”. While progress was noted, the global scale of the epidemic remained ‘staggering’ – as the report summarised “[i]n 2007 alone, 33 million [30.3 million-36.1 million] people were living with HIV, 2.7 million [2.2 million-3.2 million] people became infected with the virus, and 2 million [1.8 million2.3 million] people died of HIV-related causes”. South Africa featured prominently in the report, with the overall characterization being as follows: “HIV data from antenatal clinics in South Africa suggest that the country’s epidemic might be stabilizing …, but there is no evidence yet of major changes in HIV-related behaviour. The estimated 5.7 million [4.9 million-6.6 million] South Africans living with HIV in 2007 make this the largest HIV epidemic in the world”. The figures in brackets are the low and high estimates. Although much attention was paid in 2007 to the adjustment of national prevalence estimates by UNAIDS, this chapter will instead focus on the issue of access to treatment. The South African UNGASS country progress report for the period January 2006 to December 2007 was submitted in February 2008 [UNGASS 2008]. It noted that the South African government remained the main source of funding for the national response, and made the statement that “South Africa now has the largest number of people enrolled on antiretroviral therapy in the world”. Some of the key figures provided in this report were: ➤ by the middle of 2006, 764 000 children and adults in South Africa were at WHO Stage 4, and therefore needing treatment; of these, by the middle of 2006 a total of 353 945 (46%) had enrolled in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme and 273 400 (36%) had been initiated on ART; ➤ by 2007, 889 000 people needed treatment of which 488 739 (55%) had enrolled and 371 731 (42%) initiated ➤ ➤ ➤ The UNAIDS 2008 report provided the following estimates of the number of South Africans infected [AIDS Global Report 2008]: ➤ total infected (low-high) – 5 700 000 (4 900 0006 600 000); total adults and children over 15 infected (low-high) – 5 400 000 (4 700 000-6 200 000); total children 0-14 years infected (low-high) – 280 000 (230 000-320 000); ➤ ➤ total country reported need – 889 000; total reported by the country as receiving treatment in 2007 (%; low-high) – 458 953 (28; 22-36); and total need estimated using UNAIDS / WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (low-high) – 1 700 000 (1 300 0002 100 000). The differences in the estimates of those in need of treatment (assumed to be presenting with advanced HIV) vary considerably, and thus so do the estimates of the percentage covered. The South African UNGASS country progress report also included data on the number of public sector accredited service points providing ‘comprehensive HIV and AIDS services’. By the end of 2007, such services were available from 362 public sector health facilities, located in more than 80% of the 254 local municipalities and metropolitan areas. It did, however, identify a number of remaining challenges, including “recruitment of adequate numbers of human resources, strengthening the district based referral systems with effective utilisation of primary health care facilities, promotion of healthy lifestyles and strengthening of national health information systems”. Similar challenges – the results of “weak health systems, a critical shortage of human resources and lack of long-term sustained financing” – have been identified in many countries failing to meet the challenge of universal access [Universal Access 2008]. This joint WHO / UNAIDS / UNICEF publication also points out that “even high-income countries with well-developed infrastructure have difficulty in reaching 100% of the people who need interventions”. It cited evidence that, as recently

on ART programme (approximately 55% female and 45% male); and ➤ the estimated number of children (younger than 15years) needing treatment was 52 000 in 2006 and 65 000 in 2007, of which 23 369 received treatment in 2006 and 32 060 in 2007.

as 2005, only 55% of the people who needed ART in the

309

United	 States	 received	 it.	 The	 report	 unpacked	 ‘access’	 in	 terms	of	three	dimensions: ➤	 “availability”	–	defined	in	terms	of	the	physical	access,	 economic	 access	 and	 socio-cultural	 access	 of	 services	 that	meet	a	minimum	standard	of	quality;	 ➤	 ➤	 “coverage”	 –	 defined	 as	 the	 proportion	 of	 the	 people	 needing	an	intervention	who	receive	it;	and	 “outcome and impact”	–	defined	in	terms	of	behavioural	 change,	lower	infection	rates	or	higher	survival	rates. Put	 another	 way,	 “[o]utcome and impact are the result of coverage, modulated by the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions. In addition to the availability, coverage and outcome and impact of interventions, other aspects also determine the attainment of universal access, including whether the services are provided in an equitable manner and their quality, acceptability and effectiveness”. It	also	noted	that	estimating	ART	need	and	coverage	raised	a	 number	of	methodological	questions.	While	the	numerator	 (the	 number	 receiving	 treatment)	 could	 be	 derived	 fairly	 simply	 from	 national	 programme	 reporting	 systems,	 the	 denominator	 (the	 number	 in	 need	 of	 treatment)	 required	 statistical	 modelling.	 Key	 to	 this	 modelling	 exercise	 were	 the	 assumptions	 about	 when	 treatment	 would	 be	 needed.	 Figure	7	 clearly	 shows	 how,	 while	 South	 Africa’s	 ART	 programme	 dwarfs	 many	 others,	 it	 still	 lags	 behind	 many	 other	 developing	 countries’	 programmes	 in	 terms	 of	 coverage.	 A	 number	 of	 other	 factors	 need	 to	 be	 taken	 into	 account	 when	 assessing	 ART	 coverage.	 The	 first	 is	 the	 local	 policy	

for	 initiation	 of	 ART,	 and	 how	 this	 relates	 to	 the	 most	 recent	 guidelines	 issued	 by	 various	 authorities.	 South	 Africa	 has	 retained	 a	 lower	 CD4	 cut-off	 for	 initiation	 of	 adult	 and	 adolescent	 patients	 than	 is	 the	 internationally	 accepted	norm.	The	difference	between	‘enrolled	in	the	ART	 programme’,	‘initiated	on	ART’	and	‘currently	receiving	ART’	 also	need	to	be	explored.	Despite	a	clear	commitment	in	the	 2004	Comprehensive	Plan	to	develop	suitable	patient	record	 systems	that	would	allow	for	each	of	these	three	parameters	 to	be	tracked	with	acceptable	accuracy,	such	systems	are	not	 yet	in	place.	The	national	programme	in	South	Africa	is	thus	 not	able	to	say	how	many	patients	enrolled	on	the	programme	 fail	to	start	ART	(either	defaulting	during	the	preparedness	 phase	or	dying	before	accessing	treatment),	and	how	many	 of	 those	 who	 initiated	 ART	 are	 still	 receiving	 treatment.	 In	 addition,	 those	 data	 that	 are	 available	 are	 not	 suitably	 disaggregated	in	order	to	show	the	extent	to	which	access	is	 equitable.	These	issues	were	extensively	aired	in	a	roundtable	 conference	 held	 in	 October	 2007	 at	 the	 University	 of	 the	 Free	State	[Health	Systems	ARV	access].	Also	presented	were	 more	detailed	data	from	individual	provincial	programmes.	 Data	 from	 the	 Free	 State	 highlighted	 the	 problems	 of	 late	 enrolment.	Of	a	cohort	of	14	627	patients	enrolled	over	18	 months,	6	889	(48%)	were	assessed	as	eligible	to	start	ART.	 However,	only	3	619	(53%	of	those	eligible)	actually	received	 ART.	More	tellingly,	of	the	2	422	deaths	recorded,	87%	were	 in	the	pre-ART	group.	Mortality	was	reduced	by	86%	in	those	 who	did	start	ART.	Data	from	WC	showed	that,	of	a	cohort	 of	12	587	patients	started	on	ART	between	2001	and	2005,	 82%	 remained	 on	 treatment	 after	 24	 months,	 while	 at	 48	 months,	72%	remained	in	care.	Of	those	remaining	in	care,

90%	 had	 undetectable	 viral	 loads	 (defined	 as	 <400	 copies	 per	ml).	Some	of	the	key	points	made	at	the	conference	were	 as	follows: ➤	 “Universal access to ART is unlikely to be achieved with the predominant model of ART service delivery currently being implemented in the public health system, namely, vertical services funded through ring-fenced resources and provided in 313 (at the time of presentation) accredited comprehensive care, management and treatment (CCMT) sites, based in hospitals, community health centres or PHC clinics, and provided by doctors, professional nurses and pharmacists.” ➤	 “The need for ART is expanding by about 500 000 people per annum. In order to meet 80% of this need, each of the existing 313 accredited sites would have to enrol more than 100 new patients each month with current use of resources. Very few CCMT sites are able to achieve this level of enrolment. Quite the converse is true: as sites become more saturated, the rates of enrolment tend to decline – and simultaneously the ability to ensure retention in care.” Calls	 for	 simplified	 and	 standardised	 approaches	 to	 monitoring	and	evaluation	(M&E)	have	been	made	repeatedly,	 but	 there	 is	 little	 evidence	 of	 progress	 in	 this	 regard.	 A	 district-level	determination	of	the	‘treatment	gap’	may	well	 be	the	first	step,	as	advocated	by	Barker	and	Venter	[SAMJ	 97(916-7)].	 Table	 18	 shows	 some	 selected	 national	 targets	 from	the	current	national	HIV	Strategic	Plan.	In	the	absence	 of	 accurate	 national	 treatment	 figures,	 it	 is	 impossible	 to	 show	progress	towards	attainment	of	the	treatment	target	 over	time.

Some	 idea	 of	 the	 possibilities	 can	 be	 gauged	 from	 reports	 from	single	programmes,	though	these	are	in	all	likelihood	 far	 removed	 from	 the	 norm.	 For	 example,	 Fredlund	 and	 Nash	 have	 reported	 on	a	decentralised	 approach	 in	 a	 rural	 northern	 KZN	 district	 which	 achieved	 60%	 coverage	 24	 months	after	initiation	[J	Infect	Dis	196(S469-73)].	Similarly,	 a	 Medecins	 Sans	 Frontieres	 (MSF)-directed	 programme	 in	 the	rural	EC	achieved	95%	coverage	as	well	as	high	retention	 on	 treatment,	 again	 using	 a	 highly	 decentralised	 approach	 using	 nurses	 and	 mid-level	 workers	 [J	 Infect	 Dis	 196(S4648)]. A	 study	 by	 the	 Reproductive	 Health	 Research	 Unit	 at	 Tshepong	 Wellness	 Clinic,	 using	 retrospective	 chart	 review	 of	 patient	 files	 from	 2006,	 showed	 that	 about	 14%	 of	 patients	 started	 on	 ARVs	 had	 stopped	 taking	 treatment,	 but	confirmed	the	high	drop	out	rate	before	even	initiating	 treatment	[Tshepong	Review].	While	about	20%	of	patients	 were	 lost	 in	 the	 pre-treatment	 phase,	 the	 reasons	 for	 this	 attrition	 could	 not	 be	 determined.	 The	 authors	 referred,	 however,	 to	 subsequent	 data	 collected	 from	 inner-city	 clinics	in	Johannesburg,	which	indicated	that	about	50%	of	 pre-treatment	patients	were	lost	between	CD4	testing	and	 treatment	initiation. Although	emphasis	has	been	placed	on	treatment,	attention	 to	the	effectiveness	of	the	PMTCT	programme	has	continued.	 Data	 on	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 dual-ARV	 PMTCT	 has	 been	 provided	 across	 the	 public	 sector	 are	 not	 yet	 available.	 However,	data	from	a	single	state-aided	hospital	in	Durban	 have	 shown	 what	 can	 be	 achieved	 [SAMJ	 98(458-62)].	 Of	 a	 cohort	 of	 2	 624	 women	 who	 attended	 the	 PMTCT	 clinic	 at	McCord	Hospital	between	1	March	2004	and	31	August	 2005,	 all	 received	 HIV	 counselling,	 and	 2	 388	 (91%)	 were	 tested	for	HIV.	HIV	prevalence	in	this	cohort	was	13%	(95%	 CI:	11.6-14.2).	Of	the	338	identified	as	HIV-positive,	302	(89%)

completed	their	pregnancy	at	the	hospital.	There	were	three	 intrauterine	 deaths,	 one	 miscarriage,	 one	 maternal	 death	 (with	 the	 baby	 in	 utero)	 and	 297	 live	 births	 with	 one	 early	 neonatal	death.	Of	the	297	live	births	in	hospital,	209	(70%)	 were	 delivered	 by	 caesarean	 section.	 The	 period	 reviewed	 covered	a	change	of	PMTCT	policy,	so	while	290	babies	(98%)	 received	nevirapine,	224	(75%)	received	zidovudine	as	well.	 Follow-up	 testing	 by	 polymerase	 chain	 reaction	 test	 at	 six	 weeks	was	completed	in	239	of	269	(81%)	surviving	infants,	 with	an	HIV	transmission	rate	at	this	point	of	only	2.9%	(95%	 CI:	 1.3-6.2).	 Equally	 important,	 668	 of	 the	 partners	 of	 all	 women	attending	the	antenatal	clinic	were	tested	for	HIV.	 Routine	 district-level	 data	 have	 also	 been	 reported	 in	 the	 District	 Health	 Barometer	 [DHB	 2006/07].	 Nationally,	 nevirapine	uptake	among	pregnant	HIV-positive	women	was	 shown	 to	 have	 increased	 somewhat,	 from	 52%	 in	 2005/06	 to	61%	in	2006/07.	These	averages	hide	considerable	interdistrict	 variability.	 Data	 on	 other	 elements	 of	 the	 PMTCT	 programme	illustrate	this	point	–	for	example,	the	proportion	 of	antenatal	clients	who	are	tested	for	HIV	varied	from	a	low	 of	44%	(in	the	eThekwini	metropole,	KZN)	to	100%	coverage	 in	a	number	of	districts,	mostly	in	WC.	These	results	concur	 with	 the	 estimated	 percentage	 of	 pregnant	 women	 who	 received	ARVs	for	PMTCT	of	57%	(49-69%)	in	the	Universal	 Access	2008	report,	which	estimated	that	127	164	of	about	 220	000	women	in	need	received	ARVs	for	PMTCT	in	2007. Prevention	 research	 has	 not	 been	 neglected	 in	 South	 Africa.	 A	 comprehensive	 study	 entitled	 ‘Concurrent	 Sexual	 Partnerships	 amongst	 young	 adults	 in	 South	 Africa.	 Challenges	 for	 HIV	 prevention	 communication’	 was	 published	in	2007,	focusing	on	heterosexual	respondents	in	 the	20-30	year	age	group	[CADRE	Sexual	Partnerships].	The	 qualitative	component	of	this	research	confirmed	high	levels	 of	 awareness	 and	 knowledge	 about	 HIV	 and	 AIDS	 among	 the	 target	 group.	 However,	 awareness	 did	 not	 necessarily	 translate	into	risk	avoidance.	The	authors	noted	a	“pervasive norm of sexual partner turnover, sexual partner concurrency and casual sex”,	which	were	not	always	recognized	as	risky.	 Quantitative	 data	 showed	 that	 marriage	 in	 South	 African	 society	 occurred	 at	 a	 relatively	 older	 age,	 with	 only	 10.4%	 of	people	in	the	20-30	year	age	group	being	married.	As	a	 result,	it	was	likely	that	most	people	in	this	age	group	would	 have	a	series	of	partners	over	many	years.	A	third	of	males	 and	about	one	in	ten	females	reported	having	two	or	more	 partners	in	the	preceding	year.	Over	two	decades,	this	could	 translate	 into	 more	 than	 40	 cumulative	 partners.	 About	 a	 third	 of	 men	 and	 women	 who	 reported	 having	 more	 than	 two	partners	in	the	preceding	year	also	reported	having	two	 or	more	partners	in	the	preceding	month.	Here	concurrency	 is	higher,	sexual	networks	are	even	more	concentrated,	and	 the	risk	of	exposure	to	HIV	higher	still.	There	was	a	positive	

orientation	towards	condom	use,	with	high	levels	of	claimed	 use.	 More	 than	 a	 third	 of	 the	 respondents	 had	 also	 been	 tested	for	HIV,	and	more	than	a	half	of	these	were	tested	in	 the	preceding	year.	More	details	on	reproductive	behaviour	 are	provided	in	the	next	section. As	 before,	 the	 tables	 below	 focus	 predominantly	 on	 prevalence,	in	various	populations	and	as	estimated	by	various	 means.	More	detailed	data	at	district	level	are	available	from	 the	new	antenatal	sero-prevalence	survey	[Antenatal	Survey	 2007].	This	latest	survey	suggests	an	overall	stabilisation	or	 even	decline	in	HIV	prevalence,	which	has	resulted	in	more	 conservative	 modelled	 estimates	 for	 the	 total	 population;	 an	 estimated	 HIV	 prevalence	 amongst	 adults	 (15-49	 years)	 of	 17.6%	 (95%	 CI:	 16.95-18.33%);	 and	 the	 number	 of	 HIVinfected	people	estimated	to	be	approximately	5.27	million,	 including	184	680	children.	However,	extreme	caution	should	 be	exercised	in	interpreting	these	data,	and	in	particular,	in	 making	any	comparisons	between	data	from	different	years.	 Dorrington	and	Bourne	have	pointed	out	that	the	2006	survey	differed	markedly	from	those	in	previous	years,	making	 such	comparisons	difficult	[SAMJ	98(754-5)].	However,	they	 have	 also	 pointed	 to	 a	 major	 fault	 in	 the	 way	 data	 were	 weighted	for	age	in	the	2007	analysis.	They	explained	that,	 while	 “[i]n 2006, as intended, the districts were treated as self-weighting and the estimates of provincial prevalence rates were therefore simply the total of the results from the districts within the province”,	 the	 “national estimate was then derived, as in previous surveys, by taking a weighted average of the provincial results using the number of women aged 15-49 years in each province according to Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) mid-year population estimates as weights”.	 They	 described	 the	 apparent	 method	 used	 in	 2007	as	follows:	“In 2007 the Department appears to have introduced age weighting. Instead of treating the district data as self-weighting according to the survey design, the provincial estimates appear to have been derived by weighting each age group according to number of women in each age group in the province according to StatsSA midyear population estimates.”	 The	 implications	 are	 explained	 in	detail:	“It is clearly problematic to use the age distribution of the population of all women to weight data representing women attending public antenatal clinics by age to produce an estimate of the prevalence of women attending public antenatal clinics. By definition women attending antenatal clinics are pregnant, and have therefore been exposed to unprotected sex, and since fertility rates have a very distinctive pattern with respect to age (low for the 15-19 age group, peaking in the 20-24 age group and falling steadily to very low levels beyond age 35), the age distribution of women attending antenatal clinics is very different from that of the female population, which is highest in the 15-19 age

group and decreases gradually with increasing age. Since the prevalence of HIV also has a distinct age pattern and prevalence is lower in the youngest and oldest age groups, using the population of all women to reweight the data will inevitably underestimate the prevalence of women attending public antenatal clinics in that year.”	In	short,	these	authors	 feel	that	“most of the decline in overall prevalence between 2006 and 2007 is simply an artefact of the inappropriate reweighting of the data”.

Reproductive health
Contraception and sexual behaviour
As	was	noted	before,	a	major	new	set	of	data	was	provided	by	 the	South	African	National	Burden	of	Disease	(SA	NBD)	study	 [Comparative	 Risk	 Assessment].	 Although	 based	 on	 data	 from	2000,	this	study	provided	a	ranking	of	the	contribution	 of	 various	 factors	 to	 the	 burden	 of	 disease,	 expressed	 in	 terms	 of	 both	 deaths	 and	 disability-adjusted	 life	 years	 lost	 (DALYs).	Unsafe	sex	and	sexually	transmitted	diseases	were	 ranked	as	the	single	largest	risk	factor,	responsible	for	26.3%	 of	all	deaths	and	31.5%	of	all	DALYs	in	2000. Issues	 of	 reproductive	 health	 and	 sexual	 behaviour	 were	 addressed	in	the	2003	South	Africa	Health	and	Demographic	 Survey	 [SADHS	 2003].	 Similarly	 to	 the	 CADRE	 study	 cited	 in	 the	 previous	 section	 under	 HIV,	 these	 data	 showed	 that	 marriage	levels	among	South	Africans	were	low,	while	sexual	 partnerships	 outside	 marital	 and	 cohabiting	 relationships	 were	common.	It	was	accordingly	adjudged	that	almost	all	 sexually	 active	 women	 (95%)	 and	 men	 (99%)	 in	 the	 15-19	 year	age	group	were	engaging	in	high	risk	sex.	Condom	use	 at	last	higher	risk	sex	was	reported	at	higher	levels	among	 men	 (68%)	 than	 women	 (46%).	 Higher	 condom	 use	 at	 last	 higher	 risk	 sex	 was	 seen	 in	 urban	 areas	 compared	 to	 nonurban	areas	among	men	(71%	vs	62%)	and	women	(49%	vs	 39%)	[SADHS	2003].c	 The	 use	 of	 condoms	 at	 last	 higher	 risk	 sex	 increased	 with	 education	level	for	both	sexes: ➤	 only	16%	of	women	with	no	education	used	a	condom	 at	 last	 higher	 risk	 sex,	 compared	 with	 63%	 of	 those	 with	higher	education;	and ➤	 condom	 use	 at	 last	 higher	 risk	 sex	 for	 men	 with	 no	 education	 was	 54%	 increasing	 to	 80%	 for	 men	 with	 higher	education	[SADHS	2003].c	 Provincially,	condom	use	was	highest	for	women	in	GP	(51%)	 and	KZN	(57%),	and	was	highest	for	men	in	NC	(77%)	and	 MP	(77%)	[SADHS	2003].c	 Although	national	policy	towards	the	use	of	male	circumcision	 as	a	strategy	to	reduce	transmission	of	sexually	transmissible	 infections	 and	 HIV	 seems	 mired	 in	 controversy,	 the	 SADHS	 2003	did	show	that	45%	of	men	reported	to	be	circumcised.	 The	proportion	of	circumcised	men	was	highest	in	WC	(68%)	 and	FS	(71%),	and	lowest	in	GP	(25%)	and	KZN	(27%). As	was	emphasised	in	the	SA	NBD	study,	the	availability	of	 ranked	determinants	of	disease	and	ill-health	allows	for	the	 prioritisation	 of	 interventions.	 One	 of	 those	 recommended	 in	relation	to	unsafe	sex	/	STIs	was	to	“maintain promotion and distribution of condoms”.	 While	 condom	 distribution	 has	been	maintained	across	the	country,	dramatic	increases	 have	 been	 demonstrated	 in	 WC,	 as	 a	 result	 of	 concerted	 efforts	to	tackle	STIs.

Maternal health
The	 ‘Countdown	 to	 2015’	 has	 brought	 increased	 attention	 to	the	linked	issues	of	maternal	and	child	health.	Data	from	 the	 2003	 SADHS	 have	 shown	 good	 coverage	 of	 antenatal	 care,	 with	 women	 reporting	 having	 accessed	 such	 care	 in	 92%	 of	 births	 in	 the	 preceding	 five	 years	 [SADHS	 2003].	 More	 women	 reported	 delivering	 in	 a	 health	 facility	 (89%,	 compared	 with	83%	in	the	 1998	 survey),	and	 much	of	this	 increase	had	occurred	in	non-urban	settings.	The	proportion	 of	home	deliveries	had	fallen	sharply	in	MP	(from	23	to	7%),	 EC	(25	to	6%),	FS	(13	to	3.5%),	LP	(19	to	10%),	KZN	(14	to	5%)	 and	NW	(12	to	5%).	However,	the	SADHS	failed	to	measure	 the	level	of	maternal	mortality,	due	to	problems	with	data	 quality. The	 challenges	 of	 accurately	 measuring	 maternal	 mortality	 were	 well	 described	 in	 a	 joint	 WHO	 /	 UNICEF	 /	 UNFPA	 /	 World	Bank	publication	released	in	2007,	entitled	‘Maternal	 Mortality	 in	 2005’	 [Maternal	 Mortality	 in	 2005].	 Globally,	 maternal	mortality	has	decreased	by	less	than	1%	per	year	 between	1990	and	2005.	This	is	far	less	than	the	5.5%	per	 year	decline	which	would	be	necessary	to	meet	MDG	target	5.	 The	 challenge	 in	 sub-Saharan	 Africa	 is	 even	 greater,	 where	 the	 reduction	 in	 maternal	 mortality	 has	 been	 of	 the	 order	 of	 0.1%	 per	 year	 over	 the	 same	 period.	 Maternal	 death	 is	 defined	in	the	ICD-10	system	as	“the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes”. An	 alternative	 concept	 of	 ‘late	 maternal	 death’,	 defined	 as	 “the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy”,	 has	 been	 added	 in	 countries	 with	more	advanced	vital	registration	systems.	The	standard	 measure	in	this	area	is	the	maternal	mortality	ratio	(MMR),	 defined	as	“the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of live births”.	 By	 contrast;	 the	 maternal	mortality	rate	(MM	Rate)	is	defined	as	“the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of women of reproductive age”.	 Determining	 either	 measure	 of	 maternal	 mortality	 is	 challenging,	 as	 it	 is	 not	 easy	 to	 identify	maternal	deaths	precisely.	This	is	particularly	true	of	 countries	where	routine	recording	of	deaths	is	not	complete.	 In	addition,	even	if	the	death	of	a	woman	is	recorded,	her	 pregnancy	status	may	not	have	been	known	and	the	death	 would	 therefore	 not	 be	 recorded	 as	 a	 maternal	 death.	 If	 medical	certification	of	the	cause	of	death	does	not	occur,	 accurate	 recording	 of	 female	 deaths	 as	 maternal	 death	 is	 unlikely	to	occur.	The	report	provides	a	useful	table	showing	 the	relative	merits	of	alternative	methods	that	can	be	used	 It	is	worthwhile	recounting	the	method	used	by	the	NCCEMD,	 as	South	Africa	is	one	of	few	developing	countries	to	have	 instituted	such	as	inquiry.	Provincial	assessors	analyse	every	 maternal	death	case	(identified	on	completion	of	a	maternal	 death	 notification	 form)	 with	 respect	 to	 primary	 and	 final	 causes	of	death,	and	any	suboptimum	care	that	was	received.	 These	 reports	 are	 then	 sent	 to	 a	 national	 ministeriallyappointed	 committee	 for	 collation	 and	 analysis	 of	 the	 deaths.	 Recommendations	 are	 then	 made	 by	 the	 national	 committee,	in	a	report	that	has	to	be	cleared	by	the	Minister	 of	Health.	As	a	result,	data	on	maternal	mortality	since	1998	 are	 available.	 The	 authors	 of	 the	 Lancet	 publication	 noted	 that	 “all indications are that maternal and child mortality has increased since the baseline for the MDGs in 1990”.

in	 the	 absence	 of	 effective	 vital	 registration,	 including	 household	 surveys,	 sisterhood	 methods,	 reproductive-age	 mortality	studies,	verbal	autopsies,	and	censuses	[Maternal	 Mortality	in	2005].	It	has	been	pointed	out	that	health	and	 demographic	 surveillance	 sites	 may	 provide	 an	 additional	 source	 of	 data	 on	 maternal	 deaths,	 particularly	 those	 operated	in	rural	areas	where	maternal	deaths	may	not	take	 place	in	health	facilities	or	be	recorded	[SAMJ	97(944-5)]	 Much	debate	was	engendered	with	the	publication	in	March	 2008	of	the	‘Every	death	counts’	report,	which	drew	on	the	 data	 presented	 in	 three	 ongoing	 efforts	 –	 the	 Confidential	 Enquiry	into	Maternal	Deaths	in	South	Africa	(NCCEMD),	the	 Perinatal	 Problem	 Identification	 Programme	 (PPIP)	 and	 the	 Child	 Healthcare	 Problem	 Identification	 Programme	 (Child	 PIP).

Based	 on	 data	 from	 the	 national	 confidential	 inquiry,	 the	 reported	 maternal	 mortality	 ratio	 had	 increased	 from	 117	 per	 100	000	 live	 births	 in	 1998	 to	 147	 in	 2004.	 It	 was	 also	 stated	 that	 “[p]reliminary analysis of the most recent confidential inquiry data suggests an even higher maternal mortality ratio than that reported”.	 It	 was	 acknowledged	 that	“some of this increase is artefact because of improved reporting of deaths”,	but	it	was	nonetheless	maintained	that	 “other data suggest an increase in maternal mortality ratio over time in sites with high-quality data”.	As	shown	in	the	 graphic,	 United	 Nations	 (UN)	 estimates	 and	 data	 from	 the	 2001	Census	suggested	an	MMR	in	the	range	of	230	to	575	 per	100	000	live	births.	 NCCEMD	data	provided	the	following	pointers	to	the	major	 causes	of	maternal	death: ➤	 the	 single	 largest	 cause	 was	 “non-pregnancy related infections, deaths; ➤	 hypertension	 (19%)	 and	 haemorrhage	 (antepartum	 and	postpartum)	(13%	in	total)	were	major	preventable	 causes;	and ➤	 ‘combined	 obstetric	 causes’	 accounted	 for	 54%	 of	 all	 maternal	deaths. A	number	of	positive	developments	were	noted,	including: ➤	 ➤	 increased	contraception	use	(60%); high	antenatal	coverage	(94%	of	women	attending	at	 least	one	visit); ➤	 reduced	seroprevalence	of	syphilis	in	pregnant	women;	 and ➤	 reduced	 illegal	 abortion	 (abortion	 now	 accounted	 for	 only	3.5%	of	registered	maternal	deaths). Despite	 this,	 a	 number	 of	 remaining	 challenges	 were	 identified,	 including	 a	 lack	 of	 knowledge	 about	 access	 to	 legal	abortion,	and	problems	with	the	timing,	number	and	 content	of	antenatal	encounters.	It	was	shown,	for	example,	 that	only	68%	of	women	who	died	of	infections	unrelated	to	 pregnancy	(such	as	AIDS)	attended	antenatal	care.	Those	who	 did	not	had	a	four-fold	risk	of	maternal	death	compared	with	 the	overall	pregnant	population.	While	it	was	acknowledged	 that	 little	 is	 known	 about	 the	 level	 of	 health	 care	 received	 by	the	estimated	15%	of	women	who	give	birth	outside	of	 a	health	facility	every	year,	it	was	equally	important	to	state	 that	while	“[c]hildbirth services are widely available at primary health care facilities, midwife obstetric units, and district and regional hospitals …the quality of care that is provided varies”.	 Given	 the	 prominence	 accorded	 non-pregnancy	 related	 infections	 as	 contributors	 to	 maternal	 death,	 the	 following	 points	 bear	 repeating:	 “Knowledge of HIV/AIDS mainly HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and pneumonia”,	 responsible	 for	 38%	 of	 all	 maternal	

and prevention methods is consistently high in South African adolescents, but coverage of interventions for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment decreases along the continuum of care. The associated stigma and no continuity of care means that often a patient’s HIV status remains unknown, resulting in little crucial follow-up – e.g., antiretroviral drugs and appropriate feeding for babies and continual treatment for mothers. According to national targets, all clinics in South Africa should offer prevention services for mother-to-child transmission of HIV, including HIV testing. However, only seven of the 52 districts in South Africa are testing more than 80% of women attending antenatal clinics, and 68% of pregnant women receiving antenatal care received an HIV test. Nevirapine uptake has increased substantially, with 61% of HIV-positive women taking this drug. Drop-off occurs around the time of birth, with only 47% of babies born to HIV-positive mothers receiving nevirapine, and 26% of babies receiving co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.”	 [Lancet	 371(1294-304)]. As	 was	 noted	 above,	 the	 change	 to	 a	 dual-antiretroviral	 (ARV)	 PMTCT	 regimen,	 combined	 with	 more	 aggressive	 identification	 of	 pregnant	 women	 deserving	 ART,	 has	 the	 potential	 to	not	 only	 reduce	 vertical	transmission,	 but	 also	 reduce	 maternal	 mortality.	 The	 widespread	 and	 effective	 application	 of	 these	 changes	 is	 not,	 however,	 without	 challenges. The	prevention	of	mother-to-child	transmission	of	HIV	also	 requires	 ongoing	 care	 beyond	 the	 peri-partum	 period.	 It	 has	been	pointed	out	that,	as	in	many	developing	countries,	 “[r]outine care during the postnatal period is scarce in South Africa”	 [Lancet	 371(1294-304)].	 This	 review	 provided	 data	 showing	 that,	 although	 46%	 of	 women	 in	 South	 Africa	 breastfed	 within	 one	 hour	 after	 birth,	 only	 7%	 of	 infants	 were	exclusively	breastfed	for	up	to	6	months.	It	noted	that,	 “until recently there has been no national policy for timing or content of routine postnatal visits”.

Termination of pregnancy
The	 legalisation	 of	 abortion	 in	 South	 Africa	 in	 1996	 has	 been	credited	with	marked	reductions	in	maternal	morbidity	 (9%)	 and	 mortality	 (50%)	 related	 to	 unsafe	 abortion,	 but	 remains	 controversial	 [SAMJ	 97(1238-42)].	 Recent	 data	 on	 the	 numbers	 of	 legal	 terminations	 of	 pregnancy	 provided	 in	designated	facilities	are	incomplete.	Some	localised	data	 have	been	presented.	For	example,	Khajoane	et	al.	presented	 data	at	the	PHASA	Conference	2008,	showing	that	92.2%	of	 terminations	of	pregnancies	(TOPs)	provided	in	the	Free	State	 between	1999	and	2007	were	for	mothers	aged	18	years	and	 older.	Only	1.5%	of	TOPs	were	performed	on	mothers	aged	 12	 to	 14	 years	 and	 6.3%	 on	 mothers	 aged	 15	 to	 17	 years.	 The	 TOP	 rate	 in	 the	 province	 increased	 from	 97	 per	 1	 000	 live	births	in	1999	to	176	per	1	000	live	births	in	2007.	The	 majority	(53.9%)	of	TOPs	were	performed	before	13	weeks	 of	gestation.	 Internationally,	 the	 number	 of	 induced	 abortions	 has	 been	 estimated	 to	 have	 declined,	 from	 46	 million	 in	 1995	 to	 42	 million	 in	 2003	 [Lancet	 370(1338-45)].	 However,	 in	 2003,	 48%	of	all	abortions	worldwide	were	unsafe,	and	more	than	 97%	 of	 all	 unsafe	 abortions	 were	 in	 developing	 countries.	 Although	this	article	provided	data	disaggregated	to	regions	 (e.g.	 southern	 Africa),	 it	 was	 not	 specific	 to	 countries.	 The	 breakdown	between	‘safe’	(5	per	1000	women)	and	‘unsafe’	 (18	 per	 1000	 women)	 abortions	 in	 southern	 Africa,	 and	 the	 percentage	 of	 pregnancies	 that	 end	 in	 ‘safe’	 (4%)	 and	 ‘unsafe’	(13%)	abortions,	are	therefore	not	reflective	of	the	 local	 situation.	 The	 recommendations	 remain	 valid	 though	 –	“[e]nsuring that the need for contraception is met and that all abortions are safe”.

Sexually transmitted infections
Although	 no	 new	 routine	 or	 survey	 data	 on	 sexually	 transmitted	 infections	 (STIs)	 were	 available,	 important	 insights	have	been	provided	from	the	SA	NBD	study,	based	 on	 the	 underlying	 causes	 of	 premature	 mortality	 and	 morbidity	experienced	in	South	Africa	in	2000	[Comparative	 Risk	Assessment].	 The	 SA	 NBD	 study	 noted	 that	 the	 prevalence	 of	 sexually	 transmissible	 infections	 other	 than	 HIV	 was	 high	 in	 South	 Africa,	and	that	these	infections	were	“a significant threat – both as a common cause of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and as infections that increase the risk of HIV transmission”.	An	example	of	an	STI	consequence	is	cervical	 cancer,	 which	 causes	 more	 female	 deaths	 than	 any	 other	 cancer	in	South	Africa.	This	places	considerable	pressure	on	 the	 state	 to	 consider	 the	 provision	 of	 vaccination	 against	 human	 papillomavirus	 (HPV),	 for	 which	 effective	 vaccines	 have	 recently	 been	 registered.	 The	 cost	 of	 these	 vaccines	 is,	 however,	 a	 significant	 barrier	 to	 their	 inclusion	 in	 the	 expanded	 programme	 on	 immunisation,	 and	 they	 have	 to	 compete	with	other	new	vaccines	that	have	recently	received	 positive	 mention	 (polyvalent	 pneumococcal	 vaccine	 and	 rotavirus	vaccine).	 More	 than	 five	 million	 disability-adjusted	 life	 years	 (DALYs)	 were	 attributable	 to	 STIs	 in	 2000,	 of	 which	 98%	 were	 due	 to	 HIV	 and	 AIDS.	 The	 burden	 of	 disease	 due	 to	 STIs	 was	 20%	 greater	 in	 women	 than	 in	 men,	 because	 of	 higher	 STI	 prevalence	 and	 the	 greater	 number	 of	 women	 in	 the	 adult	 population.	 The	 authors	 felt	 that	 there	 were	 “a host of political, economic, social, behavioural and biomedical factors influencing the STI epidemic”	 in	 South	 Africa,	 and	 that	 these	 demanded	 a	 ‘multifaceted	 strategy’,	 not	 just	 a	 focus	on	‘unsafe	sex’.	 Some	of	the	insights	provided	included: ➤	 despite	 adoption	 of	 the	 syndromic	 management	 protocols	 for	 STI	 treatment	 in	 public	 health	 facilities,	 these	 measures	 have	 “not been adopted with equal enthusiasm by private practitioners, who are estimated to treat roughly half of all STI cases”; ➤	 in	addition,	in	“some public STI clinics, drug shortages and heavy patient loads limit capacity to implement syndromic management protocols”; ➤	 there	was	a	lack	of	evidence	(for	example	from	periodic	 cross-sectional	 studies	 in	 sentinel	 populations)	 about	 changes	 in	 the	 prevalence	 of	 STIs	 other	 than	 syphilis	 and	HIV; ➤	 ➤	 ➤	 the	 success	 of	 STI	 screening	 programmes	 has	 been	 variable	 –	 in	 particular,	 there	 continue	 to	 be	 “lengthy delays between drawing of blood and return of test results, women presenting too late in pregnancy to receive the full course of syphilis treatment, and women not going to the clinics to which they are referred for treatment”; PMTCT	 of	 HIV	 programmes	 have	 not	 “achieved significant reductions in vertical transmission in less well-resourced settings”;	and despite	South	Africa	being	one	of	the	few	developing	 countries	 to	 have	 a	 public	 cervical	 cancer	 screening	 programme,	 “access to this programme remains poor in rural areas, and utilisation of screening services has been low due to the common misconception that this screening is diagnostic rather than preventive”. Each	of	these	insights	can	help	to	direct	remedial	action,	and	 in	 particular	 complement	 a	 comprehensive	 PHC	 approach	 that	seeks	to	emphasise	preventive	and	promotive	elements	 alongside	effective	curative	services.

Nutrition
Although	the	most	recent	National	Food	Consumption	Survey	 (NFCS)	 was	 conducted	 in	 2005,	 the	 report	 was	 only	 released	 by	 the	 DoH	 in	 late	 2008.	 These	 data	 provide	 an	 important	means	of	monitoring	progress	towards	the	MDG	 goals	 related	 to	 nutrition,	 and	 should	 guide	 interventions	 related	to	micronutrient	deficiencies	and	overall	nutritional	 status. There	 is	 a	 growing	 recognition	 that	 many	 developing	 countries	 are	 having	 to	 simultaneously	 address	 issues	 of	 under-nutrition,	not	least	in	children,	and	issues	of	obesity	 and	 the	 resultant	 increase	 in	 non-communicable	 diseases	 (such	 as	 hypertension	 and	 diabetes).	 In	 2006,	 the	 South	 African	 Medical	 Research	 Council	 (MRC)	 released	 a	 report	 entitled	‘Dietary	Changes	and	the	Health	Transition	in	South	 Africa:	 Implications	 for	 Health	 Policy’	 [Dietary	 changes	 2006].	It	showed	that	there	were	data	to	support	the	view	 that	 “the black population is undergoing a transition from a traditional high fibre, high carbohydrate intake to a more typically western diet, which has an increased fat and added sugar intake, a lower unrefined carbohydrate intake and an increased intake of animal protein sources and saturated fat”.	 The	 consequences	 of	 this	 shift	 were	 expected	 to	 be	 “high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the adult and child population”	(though	noting	that	“stunting and chronic energy deficiency still affects a large number of infants and children”).	 Globally,	 much	 attention	 has	 been	 paid	 to	 interventions	 aimed	at	under-nutrition.	Heikens	et	al.	noted	that	southern	 Africa	was	“faced with an overwhelming burden of HIV, and the treatment of seriously ill children with chronic infections leading to undernourishment is challenging”	[Lancet	371(1812)].	Many	factors	had	changed	as	a	result	of	HIV,	including	 the	clinical	presentation,	pathophysiology,	and	prognosis	of	 infected	children.	Noting	that	“over 50% of child deaths result from under-nutrition”,	they	expressed	support	for	“a strong child-health system that supports exclusive breastfeeding in HIV-infected women”,	 continued	 use	 of	 “communitybased management of uncomplicated severe malnutrition without HIV infection”,	 including	 the	 use	 of	 “ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with uncomplicated severe malnutrition”.	 All,	 however,	 required	 improved	 operational	 capacity.	Another	article	in	the	same	Lancet	series,	by	Bryce	 et	al.,	pointed	out	that	80%	of	the	world’s	under-nourished	 children	live	in	just	20	countries	[Lancet	371(510-26)].	These	 are	the	Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo,	Ethiopia,	Kenya,	 Madagascar,	Nigeria,	South	Africa,	Sudan,	Uganda,	Tanzania,	 Egypt,	 Yemen,	 Afghanistan,	 Bangladesh,	 India,	 Burma,	 Nepal,	Pakistan,	Indonesia,	Philippines	and	Vietnam.	In	order	 to	reach	the	MDG	Goal	1	target,	as	well	as	the	related	MDG	 4	and	5	targets,	intensified	action	would	need	to	be	taken	in	 these	countries.	Some	of	the	intervention	indicators	tracked	 in	this	paper	were	the	proportion	of	households	consuming	 iodised	salt,	the	proportion	of	children	exclusively	breastfed,	 the	proportion	of	children	aged	6-59	months	who	received	 two	doses	of	vitamin	A	in	the	past	12	months,	the	proportion	 of	children	aged	6-9	months	who	were	breastfed	and	received	 complementary	food	and	the	proportion	of	the	population	 using	adequate	sanitation	facilities.	Also	in	the	same	series,	 Black	et	al.	provided	a	global	overview	of	both	maternal	and	 child	under-nutrition	[Lancet	371(243-60)].	It	was	estimated	 that	 “stunting, severe wasting, and intrauterine growth restriction together were responsible for 2.2 million deaths and 21% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for children younger than 5 years”.	About	35%	of	child	deaths	and	11%	 of	the	total	global	disease	burden	was	estimated	to	be	due	 to	the	inter-related	(and	often	concurrent)	effects	of	vitamin	 A	 and	 zinc	 deficiencies,	 iron	 and	 iodine	 deficiencies,	 and	 suboptimum	breastfeeding. Estimates	of	under-nutrition	among	children	have	had	to	be	 recalculated	since	the	release	of	the	new	WHO	Child	Growth	 Standards	 (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/en).	 The	 World	 Health	 Statistics	 2007	 report	 included	 recalculated	 global,	 regional	 and	 country	 estimates,	 using	 the	 new	 standards	 [World	Health	Statistics	2007]. Although	based	on	2000	data,	the	SA	NBD	study	also	provided	 useful	 analysis	 of	 the	 issues	 of	 nutrition	 [Comparative	 Risk	 Assessment].	 It	 showed	 that,	 among	 children	 under	 five	 years,	 12.3%	 of	 deaths	 (95%	 uncertainty	 interval	 11.513.1%)	 were	 attributable	 to	 being	 underweight.	 Of	 the	 total	 attributable	 burden,	 protein-energy	 malnutrition	 contributed	44.7%	and	diarrhoeal	disease	29.6%.	Childhood	 and	 maternal	 underweight	 accounted	 for	 2.7%	 (95%	 uncertainty	 interval	 2.6-2.9%)	 of	 all	 DALYs	 in	 South	 Africa	 in	 2000	 and	 10.8%	 (95%	 uncertainty	 interval	 10.2-11.5%)	 of	DALYs	in	children	under	5.	Further,	it	was	estimated	that	 about	7.3%	of	perinatal	deaths	and	4.9%	of	maternal	deaths	 were	attributed	to	iron	deficiency	anaemia	in	2000.	Although	 this	 was	 a	 lower	 burden	 of	 disease	 due	 to	 iron	 deficiency	 than	had	been	shown	in	other	developing	countries,	it	was	 entirely	 preventable	 and	 supported	 the	 continued	 need	 to	 disseminate	 dietary	 guidelines	 and	 monitor	 the	 impact	 of	 the	 food	 fortification	 programme.	 It	 was	 also	 estimated	 that	about	28%	of	deaths	among	children	aged	0-4	years	in	 2000	resulting	from	diarrhoeal	diseases,	23%	of	those	from	 measles,	 and	 21%	 of	 those	 from	 malaria	 were	 attributable	 to	vitamin	A	deficiency,	accounting	for	some	3	000	deaths

in	 total.	 These	 contributed	 to	 between	 0.5%	 and	 0.8%	 of	 all	 DALYs	 in	 South	 Africa	 in	 2000.	 The	 need	 for	 continuing	 monitoring	of	the	vitamin	A	programme	was	also	noted. Some	 indications	 of	 the	 implementations	 of	 these	 programmes	 can	 be	 gleaned	 from	 the	 SADHS	 2003,	 although	 these	data	are	now	five	years	old	[SADHS	2003].	Less	than	 40%	of	children	6-59	months	were	reported	to	have	received	 vitamin	 A	 supplementation	 in	 the	 preceding	 six	 months	 [SADHS	2003]	and	the	2005	survey	reported	only	20.5%	of	 children	 12-59	 months	 to	 have	 received	 supplementation	 (with	10%	being	unsure	about	whether	supplementation	was	 received)	[Food	Consumption	Survey	2005].	Figure	9	shows	 provincial	 estimates	 from	 three	 different	 sources.	 It	 shows	 a	 fair	 range	 of	 uncertainty	 in	 the	 estimates,	 which	 may	 be	 partially	due	to	fairly	small	sample	sizes	in	the	surveys,	but	 confirms	 that	 coverage	 overall	 is	 inadequate.	 In	 addition,	 the	2005	data	indicate	that	over	60%	of	children	are	vitamin	 A	 deficient,	 suggesting	 that	 there	 are	 problems	 with	 this	 programme	[Food	Consumption	Survey	2005].	 The	 2003	 survey	 included	 questions	 about	 the	 nutritional	 status	 of	 children	 under	 five	 years	 of	 age.	 It	 was	 shown	 that	 12%	 of	 children	 were	 underweight	 (below	 minus	 2	 standard	deviations	(SD)	of	the	expected	weight	for	height),	 27%	 were	 stunted	 (below	 minus	 2	 SD	 of	 the	 expected	 height	 for	 age)	 and	 5%	 were	 wasted	 [SADHS	 2003].	 These	 results	 were	 somewhat	 higher	 than	 those	 reported	 in	 the	 1994	 South	 Africa	 Vitamin	 A	 Consulting	 Group	 (SAVACG)	 survey	 conducted	 on	 children	 aged	 6-72	 months	 (9.3%	 underweight,	 22.9%	 stunted,	 2.6%	 wasted)	 and	 the	 1999	 National	 Food	 Consumption	 Survey	 conducted	 on	 children	

aged	 1-9	 years	 (10.3%	 underweight,	 21.6%	 stunted,	 3.7%	 wasted).	 Importantly,	 the	 SADHS	 measurements	 were	 only	 conducted	 on	 children	 whose	 mother	 was	 interviewed.	 Orphans	 and	 other	 children	 not	 living	 with	 their	 biological	 mothers	 were	 excluded.	 Despite	 the	 differences	 in	 methodology,	 the	 SADHS	 report	 concluded	 that	 “there are no indications that the nutritional status of children has changed substantially over the past 10 years”. Of	relevance	to	intervention	strategies,	stunting	was	shown	 to	 correlate	 strongly	 with	 the	 mother’s	 level	 of	 education,	 ranging	 from	 38%	 in	 the	 cases	 when	 the	 mother	 had	 no	 education	to	13%	in	the	cases	when	the	mother	had	a	postGrade	12	level	education.	 As	 pointed	 out	 before,	 increasing	 attention	 is	 now	 also	 being	paid	to	the	problems	of	overweight	and	obesity.	The	 SADHS	 2003	 reported	 that	 55%	 women	 and	 30%	 per	 cent	 of	men	aged	15	years	and	above	were	overweight	or	obese.	 To	mark	International	Day	for	the	Evaluation	of	Abdominal	 Obesity	(IDEA),	randomly	chosen	primary	care	physicians	in	 63	 countries	 recruited	 consecutive	 patients	 aged	 18	 to	 80	 years	 on	 two	 pre-specified	 half	 days	 and	 measured	 waist	 circumference,	 determined	 body	 mass	 index	 (BMI)	 and	 the	 presence	 of	 cardiovascular	 disease	 (CVD)	 and	 diabetes	 mellitus	 [Circulation	 116(1942-51)].	 Overall,	 24%	 of	 the	 69	409	men	and	27%	of	the	98	750	women	who	agreed	to	 participate	were	obese,	and	a	further	40%	and	30%	of	men	 and	women,	respectively,	were	overweight.	The	authors	also	 reported	 that	 “[a] statistically significant graded increase existed in the frequency of CVD and diabetes mellitus with both BMI and [waist circumference], with a stronger

329

relationship for [waist circumference] than for BMI across regions for both genders. This relationship between [waist circumference], CVD, and particularly diabetes mellitus was seen even in lean patients”.	 Physical	 activity	 was	 measured	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in	 the	 SADHS	2003.	The	final	report	stated	that	48%	of	men	and	 63%	 of	 women	 surveyed	 were	 inactive,	 and	 that	 levels	 of	 inactivity	were	higher	in	urban	than	in	non-urban	settings.	 The SA NBD study estimated that, in adults ≥15 years in 2000,	30%	of	ischaemic	heart	disease,	27%	of	colon	cancer,	 22%	of	ischaemic	stroke,	20%	of	type	2	diabetes,	and	17%	 of	 breast	 cancer	 were	 attributable	 to	 physical	 inactivity	 [Comparative	Risk	Assessment].	Physical	inactivity	was	thus	 estimated	to	have	caused	17	037	(95%	uncertainty	interval	 11	394-20	407),	or	3.3%	(95%	uncertainty	interval	2.2-3.9%)	 of	all	deaths	in	2000,	and	1.1%	(95%	uncertainty	interval	0.81.3%)	of	all	DALYs	in	2000.	Also,	87%	of	type	2	diabetes,	68%	 of	hypertensive	disease,	61%	of	endometrial	cancer,	45%	of	 ischaemic	 stroke,	 38%	 of	 ischaemic	 heart	 disease,	 31%	 of	 kidney	 cancer,	 24%	 of	 osteoarthritis,	 17%	 of	 colon	 cancer,	 and	13%	of	postmenopausal	breast	cancer	were	attributable	 to excess body weight (a BMI ≥21 kg/m2).	Excess	body	weight	 was	 thus	 estimated	 to	 have	 caused	 36	504	 deaths	 (95%	 uncertainty	interval	31	018-38	637)	or	7%	(95%	uncertainty	 interval	6.0-7.4%)	of	all	deaths	in	2000,	accounting	for	2.9%	 of	all	DALYs	(95%	uncertainty	interval	2.4-3.0%).	The	burden	 in	 females	 was	 approximately	 double	 that	 in	 males.	 Levels	 of	 inactivity	 were	 notably	 higher	 in	 South	 Africans	 than	 elsewhere	in	the	world	[Am	J	Prev	Med	34(486-94)]. A	view	in	microcosm	was	provided	by	a	study	conducted	in	 Khayelitsha	and	presented	by	Matoti-Mvalo	and	Puoane	at	 the	 PHASA	 2008	 Conference.	 The	 study	 aimed	 to	 explore	 the	 perception	 that	 a	 thin	 person	 is	 infected	 with	 HIV	 and	 AIDS	 and	 the	 effect	 of	 this	 perception	 on	 women’s	 body	 images.	It	was	reported	that	more	than	80%	of	the	women	 who	 participated	 in	 the	 study	 were	 overweight	 or	 obese	 and	 thought	 that	 being	 overweight	 or	 obese	 was	 healthy.	 A	 large	 body	 size	 was	 associated	 by	 women	 with	 many	 positive	attributes	such	as	dignity,	attractiveness	and	having	 enough	money	to	feed	the	family.	As	expected,	while	some	 participants	 were	 aware	 that	 being	 overweight	 and	 obese	 was	 a	 risk	 factor	 for	 non-communicable	 diseases,	 they	 feared	that	weight	loss	might	label	them	as	being	infected	 with	HIV.	 An	overview	of	the	global	epidemic	of	obesity	has	identified	 the	 following	 factors	 as	 major	 contributors	 [Epidemiol	 Rev	 29(1-5)]: ➤	 “urban planning that promotes car use, necessitates long commutes, and restricts opportunities for walking”;

➤	

“limited and/or unsafe public spaces for recreational physical activity and for children to walk to school”;	 “the and pervasive presence of food outlets and

➤	

opportunities to eat, usually fast, energy-dense foods”;	 ➤	 “increasing dependency on prepared foods, usually consumed away from home.” Each	 of	 these	 are	 amenable	 to	 public	 policy	 interventions,	 and	are	examples	of	what	might	be	termed	as	PHC	targets	 outside	 of	 direct	 health	 care.	 Other	 interventions	 can	 also	 make	a	difference.	For	example,	the	SA	NBD	study	estimated	 that	 low	 fruit	 and	 vegetable	 intake	 accounted	 for	 3.2%	 of	 total	 deaths	 and	 1.1%	 of	 the	 16.2	 million	 attributable	 DALYs	 in	 2000.	 Effects	 were	 estimated	 to	 be	 seen,	 in	 both	 men	 and	 women,	 in	 relation	 to	 ischaemic	 heart	 disease,	 ischaemic	 stroke,	 but	 also	 oesophageal	 and	 lung	 cancer.	 It	 was	 concluded	 that	 “[t]he challenge lies in creating the environment that facilitates changes in dietary habits such as the increased intake of fruit and vegetables”. Nutritional	 interventions	 can	 also	 have	 other	 benefits.	 An	 assessment	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 South	 Africa’s	 programme	 of	 folic	 acid	 fortification	 of	 staple	 foods	 showed	 a	 significant	 decline	in	the	prevalence	of	neural	tube	defects	from	1998	 to	 2005,	 from	 1.41	 to	 0.98	 per	 1	000	 births	 (RR	 =	 0.69;	 95%	 CI:	 0.49-0.98)	 [Birth	 Defects	 82(211-6)].	 Similarly,	 the	 median	urinary	iodine	concentration	in	women	and	children	 indicates	 adequate	 dietary	 intake	 following	 mandatory	 iodation	of	table	salt,	although	now	six	out	of	nine	provinces	 have	concentrations	in	the	excessive	range,	with	particularly	 high	levels	in	the	NC	[Food	Consumption	Survey	2005].

Child health
Any	 system	 based	 on	 PHC	 principles	 will	 place	 a	 premium	 on	 policies	 related	 to	 child	 health.	 The	 overall	 trends	 in	 this	regard	have	been	reviewed	by	the	South	African	Child	 Gauge	[SA	Child	Gauge	2007/08].	While	noting	the	increased	 public	 expenditures	 on	 health,	 education	 and	 the	 social	 grant	system	over	the	last	decade,	the	authors	nonetheless	 felt	 that	 “there remain challenges in addressing historical inequities caused by apartheid, particularly access to quality education, health care services, basic infrastructure and social welfare programmes and services for the population, of which more than a third are children”.	 Of	 relevance	 to	 any	debates	on	the	application	of	PHC	principles,	they	noted	 that	“[i]t is of paramount importance to go beyond a loose concept of ‘co-ordination’ across departments and sectors where the reality is that, more often than not, governmental agencies keep working within ‘silos’”. “[s]everal point estimates have been reported for national mortality rates in children younger than 5 years, but four of the five estimates for 2005 were between 69 per 1 000 and 76 per 1 000, all within overlapping uncertainty. Although the data are too uncertain for us to be sure about present trends, South Africa is one of 12 countries in which the child mortality rate has increased instead of falling since 1990. As a result, South Africa has to now achieve an average yearly rate of reduction of 14% to meet MDG 4 by 2015”	(see	Figure	 11	in	Chapter	4). The	 perinatal	 mortality	 rate	 (PNMR)	 indicator	 is	 more	 amenable	 to	 regular	 monitoring	 through	 various	 sources	 such	 as	 DHIS,	 vital	 registration	 and	 PPIP.	 Data	 from	 these	 sources	were	presented	in	the	chapter	last	year	[SAHR	2007	 Ch15].	Although	there	are	some	discrepancies,	at	a	national	 level	data	between	2000	and	2006	suggest	that	the	minimum	 estimate	for	PNMR	in	South	Africa	has	varied	between	about	 34-40	per	1	000	births. The	 new	 report	 of	 the	 Child	 Healthcare	 Problem	 Identification	Programme	(Child	PIP)	provides	detailed	insight	into	the	 context	and	causes	of	child	deaths	from	26	hospitals	around	 the	 country	 [Saving	 Children	 2006].

Child mortality
As	the	various	definitions	of	mortality	in	this	age	group	are	 potentially	confusing	and	overlapping,	the	following	graphic	 is	 provided.	 At	 the	 outset,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 note	 that	 the	 estimates	 of	 childhood	 mortality	 from	 the	 SADHS	 2003	 are	not	considered	plausible	or	reliable,	and	should	not	be	 used.

resources	are	critical	factors;	“The health context of children who died was one of HIV, malnutrition and poverty, and the main causes of death were acute respiratory tract infection (including pneumocystis pneumonia), diarrhoeal disease, sepsis and tuberculosis... Sixty-five percent of the children who died were malnourished. Almost half of the children who died (49%) were eligible for ART on the basis of clinical

HIV staging. Modifiable factors occurred in the home, clinics, emergency and paediatric wards with the majority attributable to clinical personnel.”	 It	 is	 also	 apparent	 that	 poor	implementation	of	proven	interventions	is	an	ongoing	 issue,	 with	 for	 example	 only	 5%	 of	 children	 who	 died	 on	 ART	 when	 49%	 of	 children	 were	 eligible	 for	 ART,	 and	 35%	

If	 it	 is	 accepted	 that	 the	 under-five	 mortality	 rate	 (U5MR)	 rate	in	South	Africa	in	1990	was	60,	then	the	country	needs	 to	achieve	an	U5MR	of	20	by	2015	to	meet	its	MDG	target.	 As	 has	 been	 pointed	 out	 by	 Sanders	 et	 al.,	 in	 contrast	 to	 most	countries,	the	U5MR	in	South	Africa	is	rising	rather	than	 declining	 [Critical	 Health	 Perspectives	 1].	 The	 publication	 in	 Lancet	 in	 2008	 by	 the	 South	 Africa	 Every	 Death	 Counts	 Writing	 Group	 (‘Every	 death	 counts:	 use	 of	 mortality	 audit	 data	 for	 decision	 making	 to	 save	 the	 lives	 of	 mothers,	 babies,	and	children	in	South	Africa’)	provides	an	overview	 of	the	best	available	data	and	estimates	for	both	U5MR	and	 MMR	 [Lancet	 371(1294-304)].	 The	 authors	 point	 out	 that	

of	 children	 with	 confirmed	 or	 suspected	 pneumocystis	 pneumonia	 never	 having	 received	 cotrimoxazole.	 Almost	 83%	of	modifiable	factors	listed	at	the	PHC	level	showed	a	 failure	 to	 successfully	 practice	 the	 Integrated	 Management	 of	 Childhood	 Illnesses	 (IMCI)	 programme	 [Saving	 Children	 2006]. As	the	only	data	showing	child	mortality	and	related	indicators	by	ethnic	group	are	obtainable	from	the	SADHS,	and	in	 many	instances	no	estimate	can	be	given	for	White	children,	 due	to	the	small	numbers	included	in	the	survey,	these	data	 are	 not	 represented.	 However,	 as	 race	 remains	 a	 proxy	 for

socio-economic	class,	it	is	worth	noting	the	stark	differences	 in	survival	rates	between	the	poorest	and	wealthiest	children	 in	South	Africa	cited	in	the	latest	State	of	the	Worlds	Mothers	 report	[SWM	2008].	These	suggest	that	if	the	U5MR	among	

the	 poorest	 South	African	 children	were	raised	to	those	 of	 the	richest,	68%	of	deaths	could	be	prevented,	equivalent	to	 about	52	000	child	deaths	per	year.

Child health status and services
Annually,	 the	 release	 of	 UNICEF’s	 flagship	 report,	 The	 State	 of	 the	 World’s	 Children,	 draws	 attention	 to	 issues	 of	 child	 health	 [SWChildren	 2008].	 In	 2008,	 the	 focus	 was	 on	 “[s]trategies that can help reduce the number of children who die before their fifth birthday”.	 Attention	 was	 given	 to	 “[c]ommunity-level integration of essential services for mothers, newborns and young children, and sustainable improvements in national health systems”.	It	has	been	noted	 that	 “South Africa has health-service packages throughout the lifecycle for mothers, babies, and children, which together form the basis of an effective continuum of care”	 [Lancet	 371(1294-304)].	 However,	 the	 same	 publication	 noted	 that	 “[l]ittle information exists in the postnatal period and for the characteristic cascade of HIV interventions through the years”,	and	also	that	“[d]espite fairly high coverage of most of the major packages, including antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness

(IMCI), coverage of some important effective interventions and quality of care within existing packages is low”.	 Data	from	the	final	report	of	the	2003	SADHS	provide	some	 insights,	though	by	now	they	are	dated	[SADHS	2003].	Based	 on	this	survey,	it	was	shown	that	the	proportion	of	babies	 ever	breastfed	was	below	80%	in	four	provinces	(EC,	FS,	KZN,	 NW).	In	the	last	of	these,	the	reported	level	was	only	54%.	 NW	 had	 also	 reported	 the	 lowest	 level	 of	 breastfeeding	 in	 the	 1998	 SADHS	 (62%).	 Worryingly,	 the	 report	 noted	 that	 the	 proportion	 of	 mothers	 with	 no	 education	 not	 giving	 breast	milk	to	their	babies	increased	from	9%	in	1998	to	26%	 in	 2003.	 Other	 data	 on	 nutritional	 status	 relevant	 to	 child	 health	are	included	in	the	Nutrition	section	of	this	chapter. The	SADHS	2003	also	provided	some	data	on	the	prevalence	 of	orphanhood	at	that	time.	The	final	report	stated	that	the	 proportion	 of	 children	 under	 15	 years	 who	 had	 lost	 both	 parents	 had	 increased	 from	 0.8%	 in	 1998	 to	 2.4%	 in	 2003	 [SADHS	2003].

Immunisation
Problems	 with	 the	 determination	 of	 accurate	 denominator	 data	 continue	 to	 bedevil	 the	 calculation	 of	 immunisation	 coverage.	 All	 figures	 on	 vaccination	 coverage	 need	 to	 be	 viewed	with	extreme	caution.	 During	 the	 SADHS	 2003	 survey	 only	 55%	 of	 the	 children	 in	 the	 overall	 sample	 had	 received	 all	 their	 vaccinations,	 compared	with	63%	in	1998.	In	contrast,	routine	data	from	 the	DHIS	showed	immunisation	coverage	of	75%	in	2003	and	 84%	in	2004.	The	authors	of	the	SADHS	report	felt	that	even	 though	 “different service providers have different ways in which they chart doses”,	 and	 thus	 that	 “data errors could have occurred if interviewers had not been adequately informed of all the possibilities of charting vaccines administered”,	“the discrepancy between the survey and the routine statistics is extremely large and cannot be explained by the methodological differences alone”.	In	addition,	while	 acknowledging	that	this	survey	included	only	408	children,	 it	was	noted	 that	the	 percentage	of	children	who	received	 no	vaccination	at	all	had	increased	substantially	from	2.6%	 in	1998,	to	17%	in	2003.
