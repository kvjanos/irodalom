Supplementary Methods

Chemicals and materials. Oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10%BSA (essentially fatty acid free, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to make a 7.5 mM stock solution (5:1 oleic acid:BSA molar ratio) 31. BODIPY493/503 was from Invitrogen.

Cell culture. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider’s Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) at 25°C as described 32. RNAi treatment of S2 cells were performed as previously described
10

. A segment of pBluescript backbone was used as the template for control RNAi (referred as control

RNAi thereafter). Transfection of S2 cells was performed using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). Images of live cells were taken using LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) with a 63× oil immersion lens.

For Arf/COPI specificity experiments (Figure 4), controls included knockdowns of COPII (sar1, sec12, sec24 and sec13), clathrin (Chc and Clc), other ARFs (ARF4: Arf102F, ARF6: Arf51F, ARL1: Arf72A, ARL2: Arf84F and ARL3: CG6560), GEFs (sec71 and CG31158), and GAPs (ArfGAP1 and Gap69C).

Electron microscopy. RNAi treated cells were cultured with 1 mM oleate incubation for 24 hours, fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.05% calcium chloride, 0.1M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, on ice, and then pelleted. The samples were stained for lipid using an imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide method 33, then block-stained in 2% uranyl acetate overnight at 4°C, dehydrated, infiltrated and embedded in LX-112 resin (Ladd Research Industries). Samples were sectioned ultrathin (65 nm) on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and stained with 0.8% lead citrate. Grids were examined on a JEOL JEM-1230 electron microscope (JEOL, USA Inc.) and photographed using the Gatan Ultrascan 1000 digital camera (Gatan, Inc.).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Visual image analyses of the RNAi screen. Both the first (15,683 genes; whole genome) and second (847 repeated genes) data sets were scored visually by the same two independent observers who were blinded to gene identities. In total, nearly 95,000 images (15,643 genes, with 6 images per gene), each with several hundred cells, were examined visually. For visual scoring, a MATLAB script was utilized that allowed lipid droplets in each image (six per gene) to be scored for three criteria: number (more, normal, fewer), size (smaller, normal, larger), and dispersion (more, normal, less). These scores were imported to a spreadsheet to compile a hit list. In the first round of visual scoring, hits were defined as those genes identified as abnormal by both observers. The same observers and procedures were used in the visual screen of the repeat data set.

Automated image analyses. Both the initial and repeat data sets were analyzed by automated image analysis. DAPI and BODIPY images from the initial screen were analyzed by using a series of MATLAB scripts (for a detailed description see http://mpibcms.biochem.mpg.de/en/rg/lipidrophe/absatz_01.html). In short, DAPI images were used to segment the images into individual cells by using Otsu’s thresholding 34 and watershed segmentation from the image processing toolbox. Similarly, the BODIPY signal outline was determined by thresholding. The cell shapes were overlaid on the BODIPY image and several parameters of the BODIPY signal (e.g., size, intensity, and numbers of clusters) were measured and averaged per cell, excluding cells at the boundary of the image and cell clumps. Images with few cells were flagged, as were images with abnormal DAPI signals. Among the parameters, the total signal per image, and the number of clusters and the mean signal per cell proved most useful and were further used for statistical analysis. In particular, for descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) was determined for the values of each parameter and conditions that resulted in a signal more than 1.5 deviant from the lower (0.25) or higher (0.75) percentile were considered hits for this category. Lists of hits for each category were compiled in a spreadsheet and compared with the results from visual screening. Quantitative PCR. dsRNAs (16 µg) were added to individual wells of 6-well plates. After 4 days, cells were harvested and lysed in RNA-Stat-60 (Tel-test). Total RNA (1.5µg) was used to synthesize firststrand cDNAs by using SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase and random hexomer primers (Invitrogen).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with the ABI Perkin Elmer Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR green detection of amplified products. Each 25µl PCR reaction mix contained 2µl cDNA, 12.5µl 2x SYBR Green master mixture (Qiagen) and 600 nM of primers (midway forward: 5′–CCAAGCTGGTGCAATATCCT–3′, midway reverse: 5′–CACCACCTCCAATAAACGCT–3′, Arf79F forward: 5′–GTCGCCTGGATGTACCAGTT–3′, Arf79F reverse: 5′–GTATCGGTGAGGCGAGAGAG–3′, Aldh forward: 5′–GAGGGCCTACCCGGCTACT–3′, and Aldh reverse: 5′–CTCCCTTGCAATGGTCATATCA–3′). Aldh (Aldehyde dehydrogenase) 35 was used as an internal reference gene.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae studies. Strains examined were wild-type (Cry1, W303), a control strain (Δ4) lacking neutral lipid synthesis enzymes (Dga1, Lro1, Are1, Are2) and lipid droplets (a gift from Sten Stymne), and Δarf1 (W303). Yeast strains were cultured in YPD media. At O.D.600 = 0.8, aliquots were taken from culture and BODIPY (1µg/ml) dye was added. Images were obtained with a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).

Endoribonuclease-prepared short-interfering RNA (esiRNA) treatment of hepatoma cells and HeLa cells. esiRNAs targeting ARF1 (mammalian homolog of Arf79F), GBF1 (mammalian homolog of garz), ARCN1 (mammalian homolog of δCop), FASN (mammalian homolog of FAS), SREBF1 (mammalian homolog of SREBP) and SCAP were generated with published methods 36,37. The endonuclease RNaseIII was a gift from Barbara Panning. Purified esiRNAs (20ng) were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) into Huh7 human hepatoma cell line (provided by Melanie Ott) in 24-well plates. After culture for 40 h in DMEM medium, 1 mM oleate was added to the medium and cells were incubated for another 24 h. Cells were then stained with BODIPY and imaged with LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Similar approach was performed for HeLa cell RNAi treatment with the exception of transfection with DharmFECT (Dharmacon) for 30 h before loading with 1 mM Oleate.

Two representative cells are shown for each condition. Lipid droplets were stained by BODIPY and Golgi stacks were stained with antiDrosophila Golgi antibody (CalBiochem). Pre-treatment of 10 µg/ml BFA for 30 minutes before oleate loading leads to collapse of Golgi stacks and droplet phenotype similar to ARF1/COPI knockdowns.

* previously identified from Drosophila embryonic lipid droplet proteome (ref. 37) [1] A subset of the most striking genes (41 of the 132) encoded ribosome components and associated proteins. These genes showed a distinct phenotype with more dispersed droplets similiar to Class III. However, phase contrast images of these knockdowns revealed decreased cell numbers and multiple large vacuolar structures throughout the cells, suggesting that the cells may not be healthy. It is presently not clear whether these genes involved in protein synthesis are directly involved in lipid droplet biology, or whether their knockdowns result in a non-specific effect on cell viability.
