Abstract
Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represent new potential therapeutic tools, owing to their capacity to induce strong, sequence-speciﬁc gene silencing in cells. However, their clinical development requires new, safe, and efﬁcient in vivo siRNA delivery methods. In this study, we report an efﬁcient in vivo approach for targeting gene knockdown in solid tumors by the use of external electric ﬁeld pulses. We show that gene silencing is efﬁciently obtained in vivo with chemically synthesized siRNA after targeted electrical delivery in the tumor-bearing mouse. The associated gene silencing was followed on the same animal by ﬂuorescence imaging and conﬁrmed by qPCR. Gene silencing obtained in tumors lasted from 2 to 4 days after a single treatment. Therefore, this method should allow gene function analysis or organ treatment by a localized delivery of siRNAs. Key words: RNA interference, siRNA, tumor, GFP, ﬂuorescence, in vivo imaging, electroporation, mice, therapy, electropulsation.

1. Introduction
In the last few years, RNAi has become a powerful experimental tool for knocking down the expression of genes of interest (1). Treatment of cells with chemically synthesized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is now used as a routine technique for in vitro functional analysis of cellular processes. Furthermore, RNAibased approaches for clinical applications are currently under intensive development. Among the different limitations encountered in the use of siRNAs for therapy, efﬁcient intracellular

uptake and safe in vivo uptake remain critical issues. In addition to different administration modes of the siRNA molecules and chemical modiﬁcation of the siRNA itself, a variety of chemical and physical methods have been developed to improve the ﬁnal in vivo delivery of these molecules (2, 3). Among the physical methods, electropulsation (electroporation) has proved to be successful for delivery of siRNAs in a large number of organs and tissues in rodents (4). Electropulsation has indeed been known for more than 25 years to strongly increase in vitro intracellular uptake of molecules and drugs. In vivo, electric pulses have been extensively used for drug and plasmid delivery in a large number of organs and tissues (5–7). A key feature is that the delivery of molecules is restricted to the volume where the electric ﬁeld is generated. A physical targeting of the effect is therefore possible. In order to assess the contribution of electrical treatment to siRNA-mediated endogenous gene silencing in solid tumors, we used as a reference experimental model B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell lines stably expressing an enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP). The extent of EGFP gene suppression, a model of constitutive gene silencing, in subcutaneous B16-EGFP tumors was subsequently monitored over time in the living animal by whole-body ﬂuorescence imaging.

2. Materials

4. Upon receipt, lyophilized, preannealed double-stranded siRNAs (Qiagen) are resuspended at a concentration of 100 M in siRNA Suspension Buffer, heated to 90◦ C for 1 min, and incubated at 37◦ C for 60 min. Resolubilized siRNAs are stored at –80◦ C. 5. The egfp22 siRNA (sense: 5 r(GCA AGC UGA CCC UGA AGU UCA U), antisense: 5 r(GAA CUU CAG GGU CAG CUU GCC G)) is directed against GFP mRNA, and was designed according to (9) (see Note 1). 6.

2.5. mRNA Extraction and Analysis

3. Methods
In this study, electrotransfer of synthetic siRNA against GFP mRNA was used to show the efﬁciency of in vivo electroadministration after intratumoral injection in solid tumors. We compared treatment groups using egfp22 siRNA, electric ﬁeld alone, and nonrelevant p76 siRNA. It is important to use the same amount of siRNA among groups as well as the same volumes for injection to obtain reliable results. The ﬁrst step was to graft the tumor expressing the GFP, and then to determine

whether the injection of egfp22 siRNA affects the GFP ﬂuorescence expression. The expression of the ﬂuorescent reporter gene was determined by in vivo ﬂuorescence stereomicroscopy. Since RNAi-mediated gene knockdown acts through RISC-mediated mRNA degradation, validation of gene knockdown was also done by comparing the steady-state levels of target mRNA molecules in control and siRNA-treated samples by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR).
3.1. Tumor Cells Injection

1. Two days before the injection, an area of at least 1 cm in diameter is shaved on the back of the mouse with the cream (see Note 4). 2. B16-F10 cells are passaged when conﬂuent with trypsin/EDTA to provide new culture on a 175 cm2 ﬂask. After 2 days, they are harvested by digestion with trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in PBS buffer at a ﬁnal dilution of 107 cells/ml. 3. A volume of 100 l of the cell suspension is injected subcutaneously under the shaved area (see Note 5). 4. The tumor growth is followed daily by measuring the diameter of the tumor by ﬂuorescence imaging (see Note 6). 1. Eight to ten days after the subcutaneous injection, the tumor reaches a mean diameter of 5–7 mm (see Note 7). 2. Anesthetize mice by isoﬂurane inhalation (see Note 8). 3. Immediately prior to injection, dilute siRNAs to 17 M in 50 l of autoclaved PBS supplemented with 40 units of the RNAse inhibitor RNAsinR . For all manipulations of the siRNAs, use DNase- and RNase-free buffers and RNasefree plasticware (microtubes and pipette tips). Always wear gloves. 4. Using a Hamilton syringe with a 26-gauge needle, slowly (over about 15 s) inject the siRNA solution into the tumor. In the control “no siRNA” condition, replace the volume of added siRNA solution with the same volume of siRNA Suspension Buffer to keep the injection conditions similar. 5. Apply conducting paste to insure good contact between the skin and the electrodes (see Note 9). 6. Approximately 30 s after the injection, ﬁt the parallel-plate electrodes around the tumor (see Note 10) and deliver a train of four pulses plus four additional pulses in the reverse polarity (electrical conditions: 480 V, 20 ms pulse duration, and 1 Hz pulse frequency) (Fig. 2.1). Carefully control the delivery of the pulses on the oscilloscope.

stereomicroscopy. The GFP ﬂuorescence from the tumor is quantitatively evaluated at different days (see Fig. 2.2).
3.3.1. Fluorescence Data Acquisition

1. Anesthetize the mouse. 2. Place the mouse under the stereo-ﬂuorescence microscope, with the tumor on the top of the animal. The whole tumor is observed as a 12-bit, 1.3-M pixel image using a cooled CCD Camera. MetaVue software drives the camera. Take a light picture (see Note 11). 3. The ﬂuorescence excitation is obtained with a Mercury Arc lamp. The exposure time is set at 1 s with no binning. Acquire by selecting the GFP2 ﬁlter (see Note 12). 1. The mean ﬂuorescence in the gated area (whole tumor) is quantitatively estimated (measure/region measurement). In our experiments, the background ﬂuorescence is sufﬁciently

Tumors having a mean diameter of 5–7 mm were treated by intratumoral injection of 50- l saline solution followed by application of electric pulses (PBS + EP); by intratumoral injection of 50 l of saline solution containing 17 M of p76 siRNA followed by application of electric pulses (p76 + EP); by intratumoral injection of 50 l of saline solution containing 17 M of egfp22 siRNA followed (antiGFP + EP) or not followed (antiGFP – EP) by application of electric pulses. B16-F10 GFP-derived tumors are clearly detected under the animal’s skin upon ﬂuorescence excitation and tumor margin can be easily deﬁned. This enables measurement of the tumor area and ﬂuorescence intensity over a period of 4 days after treatment.

low so that it does not interfere with quantitation when GFP emission is present. 2. To quantify the relative time-dependence of knockdown induced by siRNA (Fig. 2.3), use the respective intensity of each tumor at day 0 as an animal-speciﬁc internal control. The relative ﬂuorescence on day x is represented by the ratio of the ﬂuorescence on day x to this “internal control.”
3.4. Statistical Analysis

Six different animals are treated for each condition. Fluorescence level differences between conditions are statistically compared by an unpaired t-test using Prism software (version 4.02, Graphpad).

Vertical bars represent standard deviation. Differences in ﬂuorescence levels between AntiGFP – EP and AntiGFP + EP conditions were statistically compared using an unpaired two-sided t-test using KyPlot software. ∗ p < 0.05 and ∗∗ p < 0.01 were plotted when observed.

3.5.1. Tumor Preparation and RNA Stabilization of Isolated Tumors

1. Process the tumor immediately after recovery. Work as quickly as possible until tumor tissue reaches the RNA stabilization step (see Note 13). 2. Brieﬂy dip the recovered tumor in ice-cold PBS and dry by rolling the tumor a few seconds on a sterile paper towel. 3. Quickly weigh the tumor. If required, cut the tumor tissue into pieces of up to 50 mg each using a sterile scalpel blade. 4. Place each tumor sample in a 1.5-ml microtube preﬁlled with at least 10 volumes (i.e., 10 l/mg of tissue) of RNAlaterTM RNA stabilization reagent (making sure that the sample is fully submerged in the solution). Incubate samples overnight at 4◦ C prior to RNA extraction. For long-term storage, place the tubes at –20◦ C after an initial overnight incubation at 4◦ C. 1. In order to avoid possible RNA degradation, the duration time of manipulation of the stabilized tumor should be kept to a minimum. Tumors should therefore be processed one

at a time until the homogenization step in Qiagen RNeasyR RLT lysis buffer has been completed. Prior to extraction, preﬁll commercial lysing matrix D tubes with 800 l of RNeasyR RLT lysis buffer and 8 l β-mercaptoethanol. Vortex the tubes for a few seconds. Recover the stabilized tumor (stored at 4◦ C or –20◦ C) from the RNAlater solution using forceps, and brieﬂy dry it by rolling on a sterile paper towel. Add tumor to the lysing matrix D tube containing RLT lysis buffer and immediately proceed to sample homogenization for 25 s at a setting of 6.0 using the FastPrepR grinding device. Cool the lysing matrix D tube for 30 s on ice, and then store tube at room temperature. When all tumors have been homogenized, centrifuge lysing matrix D tubes for 3 min at 12,000×g at room temperature. Transfer supernatants in 1.5-ml microtubes by pipetting, and recentrifuge for another 1 min at 12,000×g. Transfer supernatants to new 1.5-ml microtubes, avoiding any turbid material (if present). Process to RNA puriﬁcation according to Qiagen’s RNeasyR Mini Handbook protocol without any modiﬁcation (see Note 14).

3.5.3. Determination of RNA Yield and Control of Integrity

1. For handling of puriﬁed RNA, use DNase- and RNasefree buffers, RNase-free plasticware, and wear gloves (see Note 15). 2. Determine RNA yield by measuring absorbance at 260 mm (OD260 ) on a 100-fold dilution of the sample in RNase-free water using the formula OD260 × 4 = g RNA per l. 3. RNA integrity is routinely checked by agarose gel electrophoresis under native conditions (see Note 16). Prepare autoclaved 1X TAE for the gel and electrophoresis buffer. Prepare a 1% agarose gel in autoclaved 1X TAE electrophoresis buffer containing 0.5 g/ml ethidium bromide. 4. Load 1–2 g puriﬁed RNA in 1X RNase-free loading buffer. Run the gel at up to 10 V/cm until the bromophenol blue dye reaches the lower third of the gel. 5. Photograph under UV illumination (no destaining is required). Under these conditions, two high-intensity, sharp, major bands corresponding to the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs should be detected (Fig. 2.4). By visual inspection, no signiﬁcant smearing (indicating partial degradation) should be visible below the rRNA bands, and no single band at the top of the gel (indicating DNA contamination) should be present. If quantitation of RNA bands is possible with the device used for gel image acquisition, the 28S and 18S

Lanes 1 and 2 show examples of RNA initially obtained from tumors by using poorly denaturing RNA extraction buffers and moderately efﬁcient grinding conditions. Degraded RNA appears as a smear in the gel. Note the presence of contaminating genomic DNA at the top of the gel. Lanes 3 and 4 show total RNA extracted from tumors using the described protocol. Two major bands corresponding to 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs are present. No contaminating genomic DNA is detectable. MM: molecular mass marker. (B) Quantiﬁcation of ethidium bromide ﬂuorescence of sample shown in lane 3. 28S and 18S rRNAs give sharps peaks with a 28S:18S ratio close to 2.0 indicative of intact RNA. (C) EGFP reporter gene steady-state transcript levels were determined by qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from tumors 4 days after treatments with: electric ﬁeld (PBS + EP), unrelated siRNA, electrotransferred (p76 + EP), egfp22 siRNA without electrotransfer (AntiGFP – EP), and egfp22 siRNA followed by electrical treatment (AntiGFP + EP). EGFP transcript levels were determined using a normalization factor calculated from three independent constitutive housekeeping genes using the GeNorm VBA applet. Three independent tumors were analyzed in each case. Histograms represent mean value ± standard deviation.

rRNAs should appear as sharp peaks with 28S:18S quantitative ratios of 1.8–2.0.
3.5.4. qPCR Analysis of Target mRNA Levels

1. Total RNA (5 g) isolated from the different tumor samples is used to generate cDNAs through reverse transcription by the ThermoscriptTM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random hexamers as primers and subsequent RNase H treatment. 2. qPCR is then performed on 5 l of a 25-fold dilution of the cDNA synthesis reaction using an ABI Prism 7000 system (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green dye ﬂuorescence measurements to quantify amplicon production. 3. Three independent endogenous mouse genes giving the most highly reproducible constitutive expression levels in tumors (see Section 2.2) are selected over a panel of tested “housekeeping” mouse genes using the GeNorm Visual Basic application for Microsoft Excel (11). This application is freely accessible on the Web for noncommercial academic research. 4. The normalization factor calculated by GeNorm from the selected genes is then used to determine target gene mRNA levels.

4. Notes
1. Selection of the optimal siRNA sequences remains a critical issue for RNAi experiments in vivo (for a general discussion see (12, 13)). Literature mining may be a valuable source for the identiﬁcation of “validated” active siRNAs directed against a gene of interest. In parallel, most companies commercializing siRNAs now propose various sets of “predesigned siRNAs” against any mouse or human gene, which are designed by robust, proprietary, algorithms. Similar freely accessible algorithms can also be found on the Internet (e.g., (13–15)). A validation and selection of the most active siRNAs in cultured cells should always precede their in vivo use. 2. DEPC is highly toxic and volatile. It must be used only in a laboratory chemical fume hood. 3. Ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen. Always wear gloves and minimize handling. Use speciﬁc procedures (such as charcoal ﬁltration) for disposal of ethidium bromidecontaining buffers. Use dedicated electrophoresis tanks. 4. The cream should be used 2 days before ﬂuorescence imaging because some components of the cream ﬂuoresce under blue-light excitation. This cream should be used carefully as it may cause some irritations in the mouse skin. Rinse the cream under a ﬂow of water. 5. The subcutaneous injection should be performed under the shaved area to allow direct visualization of the GFPexpressing cells under the skin. 6. GFP expression in the tumor cells is detected directly through the skin on the anesthetized animal by digitized ﬂuorescence stereomicroscopy. This procedure allows observation of GFP expression in the same animal over several days. 7. Hair on the back may re-grow; re-shave the skin above the tumor if necessary. 8. Isoﬂurane inhalation is safe; mice recover very quickly after the electrical treatment and can be observed daily for in vivo imaging. 9. Conducting paste is very important to insure optimal electrical contact with the skin. One should pay attention that the paste is not continuous between the two electrodes, as the ﬁeld will pass through the paste and not through the tumor. 10. One person should perform the tumor injection. As the tumor may have different nodules, pay attention when injecting the whole tumor.

11. One person should be responsible for holding the mice to avoid erratic conditions of exposure to the ﬂuorescence excitation beam. 12. Make sure that no saturation of pixels occurs in the area of interest upon image acquisition. Then use identical settings for subsequent acquisitions. 13. In our experiments, extraction of nondegraded RNA from tumors required use of tumor tissue pretreated with an RNA stabilizing agent together with highly denaturing RNA extraction buffers (containing guanidine isothiocyanate), as well as harsh homogenization conditions. We assume that this may be due to the presence of necrotic regions in the tumors, which may release high levels of nucleases in the tissue. Although the reagents and materials used in this protocol may be substituted with others, we recommend using extraction conditions that fulﬁll the criteria mentioned above. 14. Contamination of the puriﬁed RNA sample by genomic DNA sequences may be detrimental to sensitive applications such as qPCR. However, in our hands, additional treatments performed in order to eliminate putative DNA contamination did not modify the qPCR ampliﬁcation patterns. 15. The electrophoresis tank should have been pretreated with an RNase-removal reagent (e.g., RNaseZapR RNase decontamination solution from Ambion) to avoid any RNA degradation during electrophoresis due to contaminating RNases. 16. Although denaturing conditions provide the greatest resolution for RNA analysis, direct electrophoresis under native conditions was found sufﬁcient to assess the integrity and overall quality of puriﬁed RNA. In addition, native RNA staining is much more sensitive than that of denatured DNA.
