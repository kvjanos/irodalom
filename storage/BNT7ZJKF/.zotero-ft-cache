ABSTRACT Radial-glia-like neural stem (NS) cells may be derived from neural tissues or via differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the mechanisms controlling NS cell propagation and differentiation are not yet fully understood. Here we investigated the roles of Sox2 and Pax6, transcription factors widely expressed in central nervous system (CNS) progenitors, in mouse NS cells. Conditional deletion of either Sox2 or Pax6 in forebrain-derived NS cells reduced their clonogenicity in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Cells heterozygous for either gene displayed moderate proliferative defects, which may relate to human pathologies attributed to SOX2 or PAX6 deﬁciencies. In the complete absence of Sox2, cells exited the cell cycle with concomitant downregulation of neural progenitor markers Nestin and Blbp. This occurred despite expression of the close relative Sox3. Ablation of Pax6 also caused major proliferative defects. However, a subpopulation of cells was able to expand continuously without Pax6. These Pax6-null cells retained progenitor markers but had altered morphology. They exhibited compromised differentiation into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, highlighting that the role of Pax6 extends beyond neurogenic competence. Overall these ﬁndings indicate that Sox2 and Pax6 are both critical for self-renewal of differentiation-competent radial glialike NS cells. V 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

out spontaneous differentiation simpliﬁes the dynamic and multifactorial environment present in vivo. This provides a tractable model for dissecting the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic regulators at the cellular and molecular level and elucidating the mechanisms regulating cell fate choice of CNS progenitors. Furthermore, culture-expanded neural stem cells present opportunities for biomedical investigations and may even ﬁnd direct clinical applications (Conti and Cattaneo, 2010). NS cells self-renew in response to EGF and FGF-2 and under alternative culture conditions differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Glaser et al., 2007). They exhibit bipolar morphology, undergo interkinetic nuclear migration, and express nestin, brain lipid binding protein (BLBP), glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST), RC2, and vimentin, thus resembling a radial glia phenotype (Conti et al., 2005; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Pollard et al., 2006b). Here, we set out to explore the functional roles of the transcription factors (TFs) Sox2 and Pax6 in NS cell self-renewal and differentiation. Sox2 is a high-mobility group (HMG)-box TF present throughout the neuroectoderm from the earliest stages of neural plate formation (Wood and Episkopou, 1999). Sox2 is expressed in proliferating neural progenitors throughout CNS development and in the two main neu-

INTRODUCTION Neural progenitors isolated from the developing and adult rodent CNS can be propagated in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), either as ﬂoating neurospheres, or in short-term adherent culture (Palmer et al., 1995; Reynolds and Weiss, 1992; Reynolds et al., 1992; Temple, 1989). We previously extended these pioneering studies and described the long-term expansion in monolayer culture of non-transformed, clonogenic mouse neural stem (NS) cell lines (Conti et al., 2005).

rogenic regions of the adult brain, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (Ellis et al., 2004; Ferri et al., 2004; Suh et al., 2007; Zappone et al., 2000). This expression pattern has suggested a role for Sox2 in regulating the developmental potential of neural progenitors. In humans, heterozygous mutations in SOX2 are linked to brain abnormalities, epilepsy, and eye defects (Fantes et al., 2003; Sisodiya et al., 2006). However, genetic analyses of its speciﬁc functions in developing CNS progenitors have been hampered by the early lethality of Sox2-null embryos (Avilion et al., 2003) and later overlap and apparent functional redundancy with close relatives, Sox1 and Sox3 (Graham et al., 2003; Miyagi et al., 2008). The paired box gene Pax6 is a highly conserved TF involved in the development of endocrine glands, the CNS, and the eye (Callaerts et al., 1997). Pax6-mutant rodents display defective neural tube patterning, altered progenitor proliferation, reduced neurogenesis, impaired migration of neuronal precursors, and re-speciﬁcation of neuronal subtypes, among other defects (Caric et al. 1997; Heins et al., 2002; Kroll and O’Leary, 2005; Quinn et al., 2007; Stoykova et al., 1996). As a multifunctional regulator, the distinct activities of Pax6 are highly context-dependent (Osumi et al., 2008). Increasing or decreasing Pax6 levels may affect the properties of distinct populations of neural progenitors in different, sometimes opposing ways (Georgala et al., 2010; Manuel et al., 2007). Analysis of Pax6 funtion is therefore complex, but can be simpliﬁed by using in vitro models (Nikoletopoulou et al., 2007) In the eye, Sox2 and Pax6 interact and cooperatively regulate transcription of the d-crystallin gene and Sox2 (Inoue et al., 2007; Kamachi et al., 2001). In the present study, we have investigated their function in NS cells by conditional deletions. The results demonstrate that these TFs fulﬁll distinct but essential roles in maintaining the proliferative capacity and developmental potential of these radial glia-like stem cells in culture.

(BMP-4; R&D Systems) or 1% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories). Cells were cultured in these conditions for the indicated time, changing the medium every 4 days. For oligodendroglial differentiation, cells were subjected to the protocol described by Glaser et al. (2007), with minor modiﬁcations. Cells were plated at 3.75 3 104 cells per cm2 on poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated plates in NS expansion medium. The following day, medium was switched to RHB basal supplemented with N2, 10 ng mL21 of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA (R&D Systems), 10 ng mL21 FGF-2 and 10 lM Forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich). After 4 days of culture, medium was replaced for RHB basal supplemented with N2, 30 ng mL21 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3; SigmaAldrich) and 200 lM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). For time-lapse analyses, 6 3 103 cells cm22 were seeded in 24-well Image Lock plates (Essen Bioscience). Three images per well were acquired every 30 min using an IncuCyte Live Cell imaging system (Essen Instruments). Conﬂuence measurements for each time point were obtained using the IncuCyte cell density detection software. At least two wells per condition were analyzed in each experiment. Gene Excision in NS Cells Conditional mutant NS cells were transiently transfected with a pCAG-Cre-IRES-GFP plasmid using a Nucleofector (Solution V, Programme T-020; Amaxa, Lonza). After 40 h, NS cells expressing GFP were sorted from GFP2 cells with a MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). Dead cells were excluded using ToPro3 (Invitrogen) or DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Puriﬁed cells were either collected as populations or individually deposited into 96-well plates containing NS expansion medium supplemented with B27 (Gibco). In some experiments, recombinant mouse sonic hedgehog (Shh; R&D systems) was added at 250 ng mL21. Flow Cytometry Analysis NS cells were collected with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco), washed with RHB basal medium, and incubated for 20 min with anti-PDGFRa (CD140a, rat IgG2a APC-conjugated; 1:400; eBioscience) or anti-NG2 (rabbit IgG; 1:1,000; Chemicon). Cells were washed once with medium and, when necessary, labeled with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000, Invitrogen). After one wash with medium, cells were resuspended in RHB basal medium containing 1 ng mL21 DAPI and analyzed on a CyAn ADP (DAKO Cytomation). Immunocytochemistry Except for O4 staining, which was performed on live cells, we used standard immunocytochemistry techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Time-Lapse Imaging , Sox2 , Pax6 , and Stable Sox2 Pax6loxP/loxP NS cell lines were established from E14.5 or E16.5 mouse forebrain and maintained as described (Conti et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2006a). NS expansion medium consisted of RHB basal medium (StemCell Sciences) supplemented with modiﬁed N2 (prepared in house; Ying and Smith, 2003) and 10 ng mL21 of both recombinant mouse EGF and FGF-2 (PeproTech EC). For passaging, cultures were dissociated into single cells by 1- to 2min Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich or PAA Laboratories) treatment at 37°C and replated 1:3 to 1:5 every 2–3 days. To induce astroglial differentiation, 2.5 3 104 cells cm22 were plated on gelatin-coated plates in NS expansion medium. Cells were allowed to attach and medium was replaced by RHB basal plus N2 and 10 ng mL21 of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 4

PBST (0.1% Triton X-100/PBS). Cells were blocked for at least 30 min in 3% serum/1% BSA/PBST and incubated with the primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. After removal of primary antibody, cells were washed thrice with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Then, cells were washed twice with PBST and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Primary antibodies were: GFAP (mouse IgG1 or rabbit IgG; 1:200; Sigma-Aldrich), Ki67 (rabbit IgG; 1:500; LabVision), Nestin (mouse IgG1; 1:10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), NG2 (rabbit IgG; 1:500; Chemicon), O4 (mouse IgM; 1:400; R&D Systems), Olig2 (rabbit IgG; 1:400; Chemicon), Pax6 (mouse IgG1; 1:40; DSHB), Pdgfra (rat IgG2a; 1:300; BD Pharmingen), Sox2 (mouse IgG2a; 1:50; R&D Systems), Vimentin (mouse IgM; 1:50; DSHB). Species-speciﬁc or Ig-subtype-speciﬁc Alexa Fluor 488, 555 or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen) were used. For live staining, cells were incubated for 20 min with the primary antibody in culture medium at room temperature. Next, cells were washed twice with medium, ﬁxed with 4% PFA, and stained with the appropriate secondary antibody or processed for an additional antibody staining.

RESULTS NS Cell Lines Carrying Conditional Null Mutations for Sox2 or Pax6 We established NS cell lines from fetal forebrain tissue of mouse embryos carrying a conditional Sox2loxP allele (Favaro et al., 2009) and a Sox2bgeo null allele (Zappone et al., 2000), or bearing one or both Pax6 alleles ﬂoxed (Simpson et al., 2009). These cultures were indistinguishable from previously described mouse NS cells (Conti et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2006b). They uniformly expressed Nestin, Vimentin, Sox2, and Olig2, and lacked differentiated cells expressing GFAP (glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein) or TuJ1 (b-III-tubulin). Pax6 was expressed rather homogeneously in all NS cells, but at relatively low levels (Supp. Info. Figs. 1A,B and 2A,C). RT-PCR analyses revealed the presence of the two main isoforms of Pax6, canonical Pax6 and Pax6(5a) (Supp. Info. Fig. 1B). Transcripts of Sox1 were not detected, as previously reported for wild-type NS cells (Conti et al., 2005) (Supp. Info. Fig. 1B). Presence of Sox3 protein was substantiated by immunoblotting (Supp. Info. Fig. 1C). Upon exposure to differentiation conditions all the NS cell lines generated GFAP1 astrocytes, O41 oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, TuJ11 immature neuronal cells (Supp. Info. Figs. 1D and 2D). To achieve gene deletion, conditional mutant NS cells were transiently transfected with a CAG-Cre-IRES-GFP expression vector, sorted for GFP expression by ﬂow cytometry and replated in the presence of EGF and FGF2 (Fig. 1A). qRT-PCR analyses 7 days after Cre transfection conﬁrmed virtually complete loss of Sox2 or Pax6 transcripts in the Sox2bgeo/loxP GFP1 and Pax6loxP/loxP GFP1 NS cell populations, respectively (Figs. 1C and 2B).

Immunoblotting Whole cell lysates were prepared in Laemmeli buffer (2% SDS/10% Glycerol/60 mM Tris pH 6.8/0.1 M DTT), resolved on 4–12% gradient gels (NuPage, Invitrogen), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, Amersham) and blotted for anti-Sox3 (goat; 1:1,000, R&D Systems) and anti-a-Tubulin (mouse; 1:5,000, Abcam). Species-speciﬁc horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:5,000, Amersham). Peroxidase activity was visualized using ECL Plus (Amersham).

Inactivation of Sox2 Impairs NS Cell Maintenance Sox2 ablation in NS cells led to dramatic loss of proliferative capacity. To monitor this effect, Sox2bgeo/loxP and Sox2loxP/1 NS cells transfected with Cre-GFP were sorted for GFP expression, plated at equivalent cell densities and continuously imaged for 1 week. Conﬂuence measurements showed that the Sox2bgeo/loxP GFP1 NS cells barely expanded over this period (Fig. 1B). Moreover, those cells that did expand appeared to be contaminant non-excised cells, because antibody staining performed at the end of the culture period revealed an occasional cluster of Sox2 positive cells (not shown). Interestingly, Sox2 heterozygous NS cells (Sox2bgeo/loxP GFP2 and Sox2loxP/1 GFP1) showed moderately reduced proliferation when compared with non-excised cells (Sox2loxP/1 GFP2). Consistent with impaired expansion, immunocytochemical analyses at day 7 post-transfection showed loss of immunoreactivity for the proliferation marker Ki67 in Sox2-null cultures (Fig. 1D,E). Sox2-deleted cells also exhibited diminished Nestin immunostaining and reduced transcript levels for Blbp (Fabp7), a marker of

RT-PCR and qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNaseI (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Except for Actb which was only ampliﬁed for 23 cycles, the following conditions were used: 2 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 20 s at 72°C, with a ﬁnal extension at 72°C for 2 min. Primer pairs were designed using Primer3 (Supp. Info. Table 1). qRT-PCR was performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems). Predesigned TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) or primer pairs and probes from the Universal Probe Library (UPL, Roche Applied Science) were used (Supp. Info. Tables 2 and 3). Expression values were normalized according to Gapdh or b-actin levels.

multipotent radial glia. Furthermore, Pax6 expression decreased with reduction in Sox2 (Fig. 1C,F). Sox2 has been shown to maintain the proliferative capacity of postnatal hippocampal progenitors, at least in part, by regulating Shh expression (Favaro et al., 2009). We therefore evaluated whether this mechanism also operates in NS cells. qRT-PCR analyses showed that under expansion conditions, NS cells do not express Shh. Furthermore, in either parental or Sox2-deleted cells, addition of exogenous Shh had no effect on colony forming ability (Fig. 1G,H). These ﬁndings indicate that Sox2 effector genes may differ in distinct populations of CNS progenitors. We conclude that Sox2 activity is required for maintaining NS cells in an undifferentiated and proliferative state. This ﬁnding also indicates that Sox3, which is

expressed in NS cells at levels comparable to those in the fetal cortex (Supp. Info. Fig. 1B,C), may not be competent to replace all functions of Sox2. Alternatively, a combined threshold dosage of Sox2 plus Sox3 may be necessary.

While wild-type cells displayed an elongated bipolar morphology, Pax6-deﬁcient cells showed an unusual multipolar morphology, with several long branch-like extensions and numerous small processes

Pax6 heterozygosity modestly reduced NS cell clonogenicity (Pax6loxP/1 GFP1 21.61% 64.4 SD, Pax6loxP/1 GFP2 49.47% 65.1 SD; Student’s t test, P 5 1.1 3 1023). Homozygous deletion of Pax6 had a more pronounced effect, although not as strong as Sox2 deletion (Pax6loxP/loxP GFP1 8.85% 63.4 SD, Pax6loxP/loxP GFP2 32.29% 61.9 SD; Student’s t test, P 5 1.07 3 1025) (Fig. 3B).

A Subpopulation of NS Cells Expands Without Pax6 In contrast to the situation with Sox2, NS cell propagation was not completely suppressed by deletion of Pax6 (Fig. 3B). Of 14 Pax6-deleted (Pax6loxP/loxP CreGFP1) clones that were replated, 9 were capable of longterm expansion. These cells retained a euploid chromosome count. qRT-PCR analyses conﬁrmed that all the isolated clonal lines were indeed Pax6-null (Pax6D/D) (Fig. 4A). Similar to wild-type NS cells, under selfrenewing conditions these Pax6D/D NS cells expressed Nestin, Sox2, and Olig2, as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 4C). At 70% conﬂuence, no signiﬁcant differences in the proportion of Ki671 cells were found between expandable Pax6D/D and control Pax6loxP/loxP NS cell cultures (ANOVA, P 5 0.09) (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, in each Pax6D/D NS cell line a substantial proportion of the cells displayed multi-branched processes (Fig. 4C). This altered morphology suggested an underlying difference in the NS cell state. Pax6-Null NS Cells Show Defective Gliogenesis The role of Pax6 during lineage-commitment and postmitotic differentiation of neural progenitors has been extensively studied in the context of neurogenesis (Osumi et al., 2008). However, upon completion of neurogenesis, a signiﬁcant proportion of radial glial cells, astrocyte precursors, and differentiated astrocytes maintain Pax6 in both the embryonic and postnatal CNS (Hochstim et al., 2008; Ogawa et al., 2005; Sakurai and Osumi, 2008). Hence, it seems likely that Pax6 may still be active during gliogenesis, at least in some regions of the CNS. In fact, it has been shown that Pax6 plays a role in astrocyte maturation (Sakurai and Osumi, 2008). The isolation of self-renewing Pax6D/D NS cells provided the opportunity to evaluate if the gliogenic differentiation potential of NS cells was altered in the absence of Pax6. We ﬁrst examined astroglial differentiation of Pax6D/D NS cells. Upon exposure to BMP-4 (Gross et al., 1996) for 10 days both Pax6D/D and Pax6loxP/loxP NS cells acquired a ﬂattened morphology and became mitotically inactive, as indicated by loss of Ki67 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4E). In control Pax6loxP/loxP cell cultures the vast majority of cells activated expression of GFAP. In contrast, Pax6D/D cell cultures displayed heterogeneous expression of GFAP, with a signiﬁcant number of negaGLIA

(Fig. 2D). No obvious phenotype was detected in heterozygote cells (Pax6loxP/1 GFP1). Pax6-deﬁcient NS cells exhibited impaired proliferation, as demonstrated by a reduced percentage of cells immunoreactive for Ki67 when compared with non-excised cells (Pax6loxP/loxP GFP1 12.60% 65.67 SD, Pax6loxP/loxP GFP2 34.48% 69.48 SD; Student’s t test, P 5 3.28 3 1025) (Fig. 2C,D). To gain detail into the dynamics of the cellular changes after excising Pax6, we carried out time-lapse analyses. This revealed that in addition to the morphological changes, Pax6-deﬁcient NS cells display reduced motility (Supp. Info. Movie 1). Moreover, cell density estimates conﬁrmed that homozygous inactivation of Pax6 strongly reduces NS cell growth rate (Fig. 2E).

The Dose of Sox2 and Pax6 Determines the Clonogenic Potential of NS Cells To evaluate more stringently the effect of the loss of Sox2 or Pax6, we quantiﬁed colony formation ability. Cre-GFP transfected Sox2loxP/1, Sox2bgeo/loxP, Pax6loxP/1, and Pax6loxP/loxP NS cells were sorted for GFP expression and deposited as single cells in 96-well plates. The plates were examined 15 days later and any clone consisting of 20 or more cells was scored as a colony. We found that the clonogenic capacity of each pool of NS cells correlated with the dosage of Sox2 (Fig. 3A). Heterozygote cells produced half the number of colonies compared with non-excised NS cells (Sox2loxP/1 GFP1 14.7% 63.3 SD, Sox2loxP/1 GFP2 28.8% 64.5 SD; Student’s t test, P 5 2.7 3 1024). Sox2-null NS cells generated about six times less colonies than heterozygote cells (Sox2bgeo/loxP GFP1 2.4% 61.2 SD, Sox2bgeo/loxP GFP2 15.5% 63.1 SD; Student’s t test, P 5 1.3 3 1027). Importantly, those rare Sox2-deﬁcient colonies could not be expanded further, conﬁrming that Sox2 is essential for NS cell self-renewal.

tive cells despite the dramatically altered morphology (Fig. 4D,E). Comparable results were obtained after serum-induced differentiation (not shown). Re-addition of EGF and FGF-2 for 5 days after 10–12 days of culture in BMP or serum, resulted in a substantial proportion of cells in the Pax6D/D cultures re-acquiring expression of Ki67. In contrast, only a minor population of cells reentered the cell cycle in control cultures (Fig. 4F). When cultured under conditions favoring oligodendroglial differentiation (Glaser et al., 2007) (Fig. 5A) in all cases Pax6D/D NS cells generated fewer O41 oligodendrocytes than control Pax6loxP/loxP cultures (Fig. 4G). Both the astroglial and the oligodendroglial differentiation deﬁcient phenotypes were observed in six independent Pax6D/D NS cell lines. During the differentiation process (Fig. 5A), we observed an increased incidence of pyknotic nuclei and overt cell death in all mutant cell lines after growth factor withdrawal, leading to a reduction in the total number of cells by the end of the differentiation period. To asses whether cell death may be attributable to aberrant glial differentiation, we analyzed expression of Pax6 and lineage-speciﬁc markers by qRT-PCR at various time points. This revealed that in control Pax6loxP/loxP cultures Pax6 expression increased throughout the course of differentiation (Fig. 5B). Transcripts of the radial glia/ astrocyte lineage marker Glast (Slc1a3) (Shibata et al., 1997) showed an increment in all NS cell lines upon induction of differentiation, although levels were appreciably lower in Pax6D/D cells in comparison to control cultures at all time points examined (Fig. 5C). By Day 4, control cells had activated expression of the astroglial marker S100b (Hyden and McEwen, 1966) and the oligodendroglial marker Sox10 (Kuhlbrodt et al., 1998). Levels of both genes increased more than six-fold by Day 8 (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the deﬁcient glial differentiation of Pax6D/D cells, all Pax6-null cell cultures showed substantially lower induction of S100b and negligible levels of Sox10 transcripts at any time point (Fig. 5B). We then examined expression of the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) markers NG2 (Cspg4) (Nishiyama et al., 1996) and PDGFRa (Pringle and Richardson, 1993). Unexpectedly, we found that prior to induction of differentiation all NS cell lines examined showed heterogeneous levels of expression of NG2. However, ﬂow cytometry analyses demonstrated that the proportion of NG2high cells was markedly lower in all Pax6D/D NS cell lines, relative to control cells, as shown by a negative shift in the distribution of the population (Fig. 5D). Negligible PDGFRa immunoreactivity was detected in these conditions (Fig. 5E). After switching culture conditions to FGF-2, PDGF, and Forskolin, which promote generation and proliferation of OPCs (Bogler et al., 1990; Raible and McMorris, 1990), immunostaining and ﬂow cytometry analyses showed an increasing population of PDGFRa1 cells from Day 2 in control cultures (Fig. 5E). In contrast, in Pax6D/D cultures this population was considerably smaller, or even absent (Fig. 5E,F). Further examination by qRT-PCR showed that the increasing number of

PDGFRa1 cells in control cultures correlated with a dramatic increase in Pdgfra transcripts, in contrast with the low levels of Pdgfra expression in Pax6D/D cell cultures (Fig. 5G). Expression of NG2 also increased considerably in control cells from Day 2 of differentiation, whereas in Pax6D/D cells changes in expression were less noticeable (Fig. 5G). These results suggest that the deﬁcient generation of oligodendrocytes from Pax6D/D NS cells might be attributable to a failure during the speciﬁcation and/or development of OPCs. Taken together these data identify an unexpected role of Pax6 in gliogenic competence in addition to its well known role in neurogenesis.

Sox2 is Dispensable for Astroglial Differentiation of NS Cells Finally, we examined whether Sox2 might also be involved in glial differentiation of NS cells. Since selfrenewing NS cells are not recovered after homozygous inactivation of Sox2 (Figs. 1 and 3A), Sox2bgeo/loxP NS cells were transfected with Cre-GFP, sorted for GFP expression, and directly replated in the presence of BMP. Immunostaining analyses performed 10 days later, revealed the presence of GFAP1 cells with characteristic astrocyte morphology and Sox22 nuclei in the GFP1 cell cultures (Fig. 6). This experiment does not exclude the possibility that low levels of Sox2 that might persist transiently after excision may be required for initial commitment into the astroglial pathway. However, the observation strongly suggests that Sox2 is not required to execute the astroglial differentiation programme.

DISCUSSION This study has revealed essential and non-redundant roles for Sox2 and Pax6 in mouse NS cells. Sox2 is essential for maintaining proliferative capacity and progenitor identity, even though NS cells express the closely related SoxB1 factor Sox3. Pax6 is expressed only at low levels in NS cells, yet appears to be indispensable as a multifunctional regulator, preserving normal NS cell proliferation potential and morphology and also mediating gliogenic differentiation capacity. Mouse NS cell lines display many hallmarks of radial glia, including expression of Pax6, BLBP, RC2, Vimentin, and GLAST (Conti et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2006b). In this study we found that NS cells also show heterogeneous expression of NG2 (Fig. 5D), which is considered a marker of oligodendroglial progenitors (Nishiyama et al., 1996). Lineage-tracing analyses have revealed that radial glial cells act as neural progenitors throughout the CNS, giving rise ﬁrst to neurons and, later, to glia (Anthony et al., 2004; Casper and McCarthy, 2006). When expanded in vitro in the presence of FGF-2 radial glial cells partially lose regional identity and acquire markers that would not normally be coexpressed in vivo (Hack et al., 2004; Pollard et al.,

2008). These changes may reﬂect partial activation of an oligodendroglial pathway, indicated by expression of Olig2, Nkx2.2 and, in a proportion of cells, of NG2 (Chandran et al., 2003; Kessaris et al., 2004). In NS cell cultures, continuous stimulation with EGF and FGF-2 prevents further differentiation, stabilizing these cells as a late fetal radial glia-like cell with nascent properties of a pre-OPC. Consistent with this, we ﬁnd that in expanded mouse NS cells the capacity for neuronal differentiation is often attenuated while they readily differentiate into GFAP1 astrocytes in response to BMP or serum treatment, or reinitiate the oligodendroglial programme upon treatment with PDGF, FGF-2 and Forskolin. Preliminary characterization of NS cells heterozygous for Sox2 or Pax6 indicated that in terms of marker expression and differentiation potential these cells appeared similar wild-type cells. However, further examination demonstrated that their self-renewal ability was partially compromised (Figs. 1B and 3), indicating NS cell sensitivity to Sox2 and Pax6 gene dosages. These dosage requirements are especially interesting when considering that in humans heterozygous mutations for SOX2 or PAX6 are associated with severe eye malformations and distinct brain defects, among other abnormalities (Fantes et al., 2003; Sisodiya et al., 2001, 2006). Complete ablation of Sox2 in NS cells led to rapid loss of their proliferative and clonogenic potential, as well as to downregulation of radial glial cell markers (Figs. 1

and 3A). Previously, in vivo disruption of Sox2 activity in chick embryonic neural progenitors was found to result in a similar premature exit from the cell cycle and downregulation of progenitor markers (Graham et al., 2003). However, this was achieved by means of a chimeric repressor form (HMG-Engrailed), which is expected to affect all SoxB1 factors. In vivo deletions of Sox2 in the mouse CNS have resulted in only moderate reduction in the number of mitotically active progenitor cells and attenuated neurogenic potential during fetal development (Miyagi et al. 2008). Postnatally, however, hippocampal progenitors and neurogenesis were severely affected (Favaro et al., 2009). It is speculated that at early stages of development, the effects of the loss of Sox2 are masked by the compensatory activities of Sox1 and Sox3, whose expression domains extensively overlap with that of Sox2 (Wood and Episkopou, 1999). NS cells do not express Sox1, but they have appreciable levels of Sox3, yet exhibit a strong phenotype upon Sox2 deletion. Thus, there may be a non-redundant function of Sox2 which has not been detected in the limited series of temporal conditional deletions described to date, or is compensated through a non-cell autonomous mechanism in vivo. Alternatively, NS cells may have a threshold requirement for total amount of SoxB1 proteins. In that context it is also possible that Sox2 may contribute directly to the expression of Sox3. Overall, however, it is evident that Sox2 and SoxB1 proteins have a central function in sustaining the proliferative and developmental capacities of CNS progenitors both in vivo and in vitro. In the postnatal hippocampus Sox2 mediates its activity through a non cell-autonomous mechanism involving activation of Shh (Favaro et al., 2009). In this study, we neither detected Shh expression, nor effects, in NS cell cultures (Fig. 1F), highlighting stage and region-speciﬁc distinctions in Sox2 functions (Pevny and Nicolis 2009). In vivo ablation of Sox2 at different developmental time points will clarify the relationship between Sox2 requirements in NS cells and in vivo action. Culture of fetal cortical progenitors in the form of NS cells is accompanied by a considerable decline in Pax6 expression levels (Supp. Info. Fig. 2B,C), as also observed in neurosphere cultures (Hack et al., 2004). However, we have shown that these low levels of Pax6 expression remain necessary to maintain the proliferative capacity and bipolar morphology of NS cells (Figs. 2 and 3B). Acute inactivation of Pax6 in NS cells led to a drastic reduction in the proportion of proliferating cells and resulted in acquisition of a multipolar morphology by those cells that persisted. Intriguingly, these alterations phenocopy aspects of Pax6 loss-of-function in cortical radial glia in vivo. First, analyses of mouse chimeras composed of wild-type and Pax6-null (Pax6Sey/Sey) cells revealed that cortical progenitors lacking Pax6 exit the cell cycle precociously and in abnormally high proportions, leading to an early depletion of the neural progenitor pool (Quinn et al., 2007). Second, it has been shown that in primary cultures of dissociated mouse cortices, wild-type RC21 radial glia display an elongated bipolar

morphology. In contrast, most of the Pax6-null RC21 cells show multi-branched morphology (Gotz et al., 1998). Thus, despite continuous ex vivo expansion and low Pax6 expression levels, NS cells reﬂect some key features of radial glial cells. NS cells lacking Pax6 exhibit defective gliogenesis (Figs. 4D,E,G and 5). Upon induction of astroglial differentiation, Pax6-null NS cells exited the cell cycle and acquired a ﬂattened morphology but a signiﬁcant proportion of the cells failed to activate GFAP expression. When induced to differentiate into oligodendroglia, Pax6D/D NS cells generated abnormally low numbers of PDGFRa1 OPCs, and subsequently few O41 oligodendrocytes. The defective differentiation of Pax6-null NS cells into glial lineages may either reﬂect a requirement for Pax6 during gliogenesis, or an alteration of progenitor properties which precludes an appropriate response to inductive signals. It has been reported that in astrocytes derived from Pax6Sey/Sey mice the proportion of cells expressing GFAP is signiﬁcantly reduced (Sakurai and Osumi, 2008). These authors proposed that Pax6 is required for astrocyte maturation. However, in agreement with the role of Pax6 as a neurogenic determinant in radial glial cells (Heins et al., 2002), overexpression of Pax6 in NS cells triggered a neurogenic programme (Supp. Info. Fig. 3). Thus, in addition to controlling NS cell proliferation/maintenance, Pax6 allows progression into a gliogenic fate and, at higher levels, activates neurogenesis. The different aspects of Pax6 activity appear to me mediated by dosage and developmental stage-speciﬁc interactions with TF partners and/or modiﬁed occupancy of different promoter elements. In such a scenario, selfrenewal or cell fate speciﬁcation may require a critical threshold of Pax6 to activate a speciﬁc transcriptional programme and probably also to repress alternative fates. This type of quantitative modulation of transcriptional activity has been shown to operate in ES cells and hematopoietic stem cells (Laslo et al., 2006; Niwa et al., 2000), and may be a widespread mechanism to control stem cell fates. Recently, it was reported that in the developing mouse cortex Pax6 directly regulates distinct groups of genes involved in the control of self-renewal, basal progenitor development and neurogenesis, and that increasing Pax6 levels drives the system towards neurogenesis at the expense of self-renewal (Sansom et al., 2009). Thus, Pax6 appears to be a pivot for transitions between gene regulatory networks in neural progenitors. Our ﬁndings suggest that NS cells provide a tractable system in which to investigate and manipulate these transitions.
