Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative and infectious disorders for which no therapeutic or prophylactic regimens exist. In search of cellular mechanisms that play a role in prion diseases and have the potential to interfere with accumulation of intracellular pathological prion protein (PrPSc), we investigated the autophagic pathway and one of its recently published inducers, trehalose. Trehalose, an alpha-linked disaccharide, has been shown to accelerate clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein by activating autophagy, mainly in an mTOR-independent manner. Here, we demonstrate that trehalose can significantly reduce PrPSc in a doseand time-dependent manner while at the same time it induces autophagy in persistently prion-infected neuronal cells. Inhibition of autophagy, either pharmacologically by known autophagy inhibitors like 3-methyladenine, or genetically by siRNA targeting Atg5, counteracted the anti-prion effect of trehalose. Hence, we provide direct experimental evidence that induction of autophagy mediates enhanced cellular degradation of prions. Similar results were obtained with rapamycin, a known inducer of autophagy, and imatinib, which has been shown to activate autophagosome formation. While induction of autophagy resulted in reduction of PrPSc, inhibition of autophagy increased the amounts of cellular PrPSc, suggesting that autophagy is involved in the physiological degradation process of cellular PrPSc. Preliminary in vivo studies with trehalose in intraperitoneally prion-infected mice did not result in prolongation of incubation times, but demonstrated delayed appearance of PrPSc in the spleen. Overall, our study provides the first experimental evidence for the impact of autophagy in yet another type of neurodegenerative disease, namely prion disease.

and goats, chronic wasting disease (CWD) of mule deer and elk, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. The central feature of these disorders is the conformational change of the hostencoded, cellular prion protein (PrPc) to an abnormal, partially proteinase K resistant and infectious isoform (PrPSc), which finally accumulates in brains of diseased individuals.1-5 Normally folded and mature PrPc is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor and conversion of PrPc into PrPSc seems to take place near the cell surface or along the early endocytic pathway, probably in caveolae-like domains (CLDs) or in rafts (reviewed in ref. 6). Preceding PrPc localization at the cell surface seems to be essential for conversion of PrPc into PrPSc,7-9 and studies in mice suggest that the conversion process requires direct interaction of the two PrP isoforms, possibly in a complex with as yet unidentified auxiliary factors.1 The neuropathological triad in prion diseases consists of spongiform changes in the brain, glia activation, and neuronal loss.10,11 Besides apoptosis, the occurrence of multivesicular bodies and autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm of prion-infected cultured cells12 and in neurons derived from brain biopsy samples of TSE affected humans13 or animals14-17 was reported. Degradation of organelles or cytoplasmic proteins can be mediated by macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy), in which double membrane structures called autophagosomes/autophagic vacuoles are formed. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to generate autophago-lysosomes in which contents are degraded by acidic lysosomal hydrolases.18 This mechanism is conserved among eukaryotes and has been characterized from yeast to man.19 Several studies suggest a crucial role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, tauopathies and polyglutamine expansion diseases like Huntington disease.20-30 Trehalose is an alpha-linked disaccharide synthesized by fungi, plants and invertebrates. It protects cells against miscellaneous types of environmental stress like heat, cold, desiccation, dehydration and oxidation by preventing protein denaturation.31 Many of its protective effects are apparently caused by its ability to act as a chemical chaperone.32 It was shown that trehalose accelerates the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins, such as mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, by activating autophagy mainly in an mTORindependent manner.33 In this work we show that autophagy not only plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases involving cytosolic aggregate-prone or

Autophagy and cellular prion infection

Results
Trehalose induces autophagy and reduces PrPSc. Intrigued by the finding that clearance of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein is accelerated by activating autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner,33 we investigated whether trehalose-activated autophagy has the potential to reduce cellular levels of PrPSc. Therefore, neuronal cells persistently infected with prions were treated with rising concentrations of trehalose, varying from 0 to 150 mM. In immunoblot analysis of prion-infected mouse cells, the un-, mono- and di-glycosylated forms of PrPc show signals at ~25, ~30 and ~35 kDa, while PrPSc, already N-terminally truncated by the cell, provides signals at 19, 24 and 27–30 kDa after proteinase K (PK) digestion (Fig. 1A). We observed a reduction of PrPSc when cells were treated with 100 mM trehalose (Fig. 1B, upper, lane 11). To further study induction of autophagy by trehalose, levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-I and -II) were measured. Cytosolic LC3-I, which is generated by post-translational processing of endogenous LC3, is converted into LC3-II upon induction of autophagy. LC3-II is associated with autophagosome membranes and the amount of LC3-II correlates with the extent of autophagosome formation.35 Thus, increase in the level of LC3-II can be used as a marker for autophagy induction. Similar to the reduction of PrPSc an increase in LC3-II levels was observed at trehalose concentrations of 100 mM or higher (Fig. 1B, lower, lanes 5 and 6). As 100 mM trehalose treatment was necessary for both activating autophagy and reducing PrPSc, this strongly indicated a correlation between autophagy induction and reduction of cellular PrPSc. This feature was also observed in other neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines persistently infected with RML prions or the 22L prion strain, respectively (data not shown). Next, we analyzed whether 100 mM trehalose reduces PrPSc in a time-dependent manner. ScN2a cells were treated with 100 mM trehalose for 48, 72 and 96 h and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Quantification revealed a time-dependent reduction of PrPSc upon trehalose treatment (Fig. 1D). Long-term treatment of cells with 100 mM trehalose (14 days) showed that reduction of PrPSc is not a transient phenomenon (Fig. 1C, right-hand). To analyze whether treatment of ScN2a cells with 100 mM trehalose affects viability of cells, a trypan blue assay was performed. Reduction in

aggregated protein, but also in disease types in which protein aggregates accumulate primarily within vesicular cellular compartments, as is the case in prion diseases.34 We provide here for the first time experimental evidence that induction of autophagy and concomitant reduction of PrPSc are obtained when persistently prion-infected cultured cells are treated with trehalose or other inducers of autophagy and autophagosome formation like rapamycin and imatinib. The anti-prion effect was prevented by simultaneous application of potent autophagy inhibitors like 3-MA and by silencing the Atg5 gene with siRNA. Therefore, our data show that the observed increased cellular degradation of prions is a result of induced autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy may play a role in the physiological degradation process of cellular PrPSc, as we detected increased amounts of PrPSc in cells treated with autophagy inhibitors alone. Proof of evidence was also obtained in in vivo studies. Trehalose treatment of intraperitoneally prion-infected mice delayed PrPSc accumulation in the spleen, although trehalose had not the potential to prolong prion incubation times in this situation.

viability or toxic effects upon trehalose treatment was not detected under the used conditions (Fig. 1E). PrPc levels in uninfected N2a cells were not influenced by treatment with 100 mM trehalose (Suppl. Fig. S1A). Moreover, in ScN2a cells treated with 100 mM trehalose followed by a solubility assay via ultracentrifugation, levels of soluble PrPc in the supernatant fraction of trehalose-treated cells were comparable to that of untreated cells, while clearly reduced amounts of insoluble PrPSc were detected in the pellet fraction (Suppl. Fig. S1B), confirming the fact that trehaloseinduced autophagy leads to reduction of insoluble PK-resistant PrPSc aggregates. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of cellular autophagy by trehalose leads to a time- and dose-dependent reduction of PrPSc in prion-infected cells. Trehalose activates autophagosome formation. So far we have shown that reduction of PrPSc by trehalose treatment can only be detected when in parallel autophagy is induced (i.e., with a concentration of 100 mM trehalose; see Fig. 1A). To characterize the observed induction of autophagy in more detail, cells were treated with 100 mM trehalose for 48 h and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Of note, increased amounts of LC3-II do not necessarily indicate total autophagic flux but can also result from impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Therefore, it is important to measure and compare the amounts of LC3-II in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1, which is supposed to block autophagosome-lysosome fusion,36 in the same experimental set. The used dose of bafilomycin A1 is saturating for LC3-II levels in this assay (data not shown). ScN2a cells were either mock-treated or treated with 100 mM trehalose for 48 h with simultaneous bafilomycin A1 treatment and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Treatment of ScN2a cells with 100 mM trehalose increased LC3-II levels about 7-fold (Fig. 2B), which is typically achieved upon induction of autophagy.35 Cotreated cells show a significantly increased amount of LC3-II compared to cells treated with bafilomycin A1 or trehalose alone (Fig. 2B), confirming that trehalose activates autophagy in our cell culture model beyond autophagosome-lysosome fusion, at the level of autophagosome formation. To further investigate induced autophagosome formation by trehalose, confocal laser microscopy was performed with N2a and ScN2a cells stably overexpressing LC3 fused to green fluorescent protein (N2aGFP-LC3 and ScN2aGFP-LC3) (Suppl. Fig. S2). Cells treated with trehalose or imatinib, which served as positive control for autophagosome formation,37 clearly showed punctate GFP staining, indicating the association of GFP-LC3 with autophagosomal membranes as a result of induction of autophagy. Co-staining with lamp-1 revealed that GFP puncta observed upon trehalose treatment, partially colocalized with lysosomes, indicating autophago-lysosome formation. Taken together, these results reveal that trehalose treatment strongly enhances the autophagic flux in prion-infected and uninfected neuronal cells. Changes in endogenous autophagic activity affect cellular levels of PrPSc. In order to further examine the impact of trehalose-induced autophagy on degradation of PrPSc, we investigated the effect of 3-MA, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase38 known to inhibit cellular autophagy, on the anti-prion effect of trehalose.

(A) N2a and ScN2a cells were proteinase K (PK) digested and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4H11. In contrast to uninfected N2a cells, PrPSc (19, 24 and 27–30 kDa) is detected in prion-infected ScN2a cells (compare lanes 2 and 4). (B) ScN2a cells were either mock-treated or treated with different concentrations of trehalose. Cells treated for 72 hours (h) were PK digested and PrP was visualized by immunoblotting using anti-PrP mAb 4H11 (upper). Lysates of ScN2a cells treated for 48 h with trehalose were probed with anti-LC3 mAb in immunoblot to analyze induction of autophagy (lower). Trehalose induces cellular PrPSc reduction and induces autophagy in a dose-dependent manner.

Compared to cells treated with trehalose alone (lane 2), induction of autophagy by trehalose was strongly impaired by cotreatment with 3-MA (lane 3). The same approach was used to analyze the effect of 3-MA on the anti-prion effect of trehalose. In fact, ScN2a cells cotreated with 100 mM trehalose and 10 mM 3-MA showed no reduction of PrPSc

(Fig. 3C, compare lanes 7 and 8). As pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might be affected by nonwarranted side effects of the drug used, we additionally used siRNA to knock down the Atg5 gene, an essential gene implicated in the autophagic pathway. The siRNA designed to downregulate the expression of Atg5 (Fig. 3D and E) was reproducibly able to impair the PrPSc reducing effect of trehalose. This provides evidence that PrPSc reduction upon trehalose treatment depends on the autophagic activity in the cell.

Discussion

Impairment of autophagy in the CNS is associated with neuronal death and neurological abnormalities. Mice with defects in autophagy developed neurodegenerative symptoms in the CNS without the expression of disease-causing, aggregate prone proteins.39,40 Previous studies also implicated macroautophagy as a key pathway for removal of aggregated intracellular proteins, including mutant huntingtin, α-synuclein and ataxin-3.41 However, data on autophagy in prion diseases are still very limited.13-17,42-44 Electron microscopy studies pointed towards a possible contribution of autophagy in prion disease-associated neurodegeneration, whereas others observed in

Taken together, our data show the potential of trehalose to enhance cellular autophagy, which then likely mediates lysosomal degradation of PrPSc in prion-infected cells. Interestingly, we observed a moderate though significant increase in the amount of PrPSc when cells were treated with 3-MA alone (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 4 and 8; F). This phenomenon was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays of radioactively labelled PrPSc (Fig. 3G). ScN2a cells treated with 10 mM 3-MA for 24 h showed a clear increase in the amount of PrPSc when compared to mock-treated cells (Fig. 3G, compare lanes 2 and 3) indicating an impaired degradation of PrPSc. To analyze whether the effect of activated autophagy on PrPSc degradation is restricted to the mTOR-independent pathway induced by trehalose, we tested the effect of rapamycin, a known inducer of the mTOR-dependent autophagic pathway. In fact, slightly lower levels of PrPSc (~50% reduction) were observed in ScN2a cells treated with 0.2 μM rapamycin for 48 h (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 7). PrPSc was not detected in cells treated with the autophagosome formation inducer imatinib,37 which served as a positive control for reduction of PrPSc (Fig. 4A, lane 8). In addition, an increase in LC3-II levels (~3 fold) was detected in rapamycin-treated cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 3, D). Taken together, we provide experimental evidence that various inducers of autophagy have the potential to reduce cellular PrPSc. In contrast, inhibition of autophagy seems to result in increased levels of PrPSc, indicating that autophagy may be involved in the physiological degradation process of cellular PrPSc. Trehalose treatment of intraperitoneally prion-infected mice delays appearance of PrPSc in the spleen. To study whether trehalose has the potential to interfere with prion infection in in vivo models, we continuously applied trehalose, and sucrose as a control, to the drinking water of mice which were intraperitoneally infected with a high dose of prions. First, individual mice were sacrificed and tested for the amount of PrPSc in the spleen (Fig. 5). Immunoblot analysis of spleens obtained from trehalose- or sucrose-treated mice revealed reduced PrPSc deposition in the trehalose-treated group at time points 30 and 60 days post infection (Fig. 5A, B and D). However, at day 90 post infection PrPSc levels were equal between sucrose- and trehalose-treated animals (Fig. 5C and D). In addition, the survival rates of trehalose-treated mice were not significantly prolonged when compared to sucrose-treated mice (data not shown). Although these results show that trehalose treatment in vivo has the potential to reduce PrPSc accumulation in the periphery, it also suggests that levels of trehalose obtained in the central nervous system are probably not high enough to be effective.

(A) ScN2a cells were either mock-treated (control, lane 1), treated with 100 mM trehalose for 48 h (lane 2), with bafilomycin A1 (200 nM) for 4 h prior to lysis of cells (lane 3), or treated with 100 mM trehalose for 48 h with simultaneous bafilomycin A1 (200 nM) treatment for 4 h prior to lysis of cells (lane 4).

prion-infected brain tissue a slight reduction in expression of genes mediating autophagy.44 In recent studies, we have shown that treatment of prion-infected cells with imatinib activates lysosomal degradation of PrPSc.45 In another study, we demonstrated that imatinib can induce the formation of autophagosomes.37 These two studies, however, did not determine whether the activation of the autophagic pathway per se has an anti-prion effect as a consequence. In the present study we utilized trehalose, an autophagy inducer that in fact has been seen to accelerate the clearance of other aggregate-prone proteins, e.g., of mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, by activating autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner.33 We used here well-established prion infection cell culture models to investigate the impact of autophagy on cellular PrPSc. Our data demonstrate that the degradation of PrPSc which is induced by trehalose is mediated by activation of autophagy. As soon as trehalose-induced autophagy was constrained by 3-MA or

(30 and 60 days), this effect was not evident at later time points (e.g., 90 days p.i.), and prion incubation times of trehalose- and sucrose-treated animals were not different from that of mock-treated mice. Previously, similar results were obtained in mice treated with imatinib.46 Imatinib treatment at an early phase of peripheral prion infection delayed both appearance of PrPSc in the CNS and onset of clinical disease in mice, but neither intraperitoneal nor intracerebroventricular delivery of the drug exerted significant PrPSc clearance effects in the brain. In terms of trehalose this finding was not unexpected as the anti-prion effect in cultured cells was highly dose-dependent and the effective anti-prion concentration of 100 mM is probably not achievable in tissues. Interestingly, Beranger and colleagues recently found that much lower doses of trehalose, which have no anti-prion effect in cultured cells, can protect prion-infected cells from oxidative damage, which suggests that this compound may have additional beneficial therapeutic effects.47 Further in vivo experiments are required to elucidate the impact of autophagy on prion propagation and to validate whether autophagy plays a general role in prion disease scenarios. An obvious goal of our future studies is to reveal whether drug-induced autophagy can be used as a novel avenue for therapy against prion diseases. Sc levels caused by changes in autophagy activity.

Due to the long pulse-chase period addition of 1% FCS is needed and has no negative influence on labeling efficiency in our hands. ScN2a cells were either mock-treated or treated with 10 mM 3-MA. After 0 and 24 h cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 10 mM EDTA; 0.5% Triton X-100; 0.5% DOC). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 xg for 1 min. Then lysates with and without PK treatment were Figure 4. Additional autophagy inducers which can reduce PrPSc. (A) ScN2a cells were treated for 48 h with supplemented with proteinase inhibieither 100 mM trehalose, 0.2 μM rapamycin, 10 μM imatinib, or no treatment was accomplished. PrP was Sc is detected in cells treated with the differtors and N-lauryl sarcosine to 1%, and visualized by immunoblotting using anti-PrP mAb 4H11. Less PrP ent autophagy-inducers when compared to mock-treated cells. (B) PrPSc signals in compound-treated cells are ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 expressed as percentage of control and represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments (***p table ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 100,000 < 0.001). Compared to mock-treated cells, less PrPSc is detected in cells treated with trehalose or rapamycin, xg (TLA-45 rotor; 4°C). Pellet fractions respectively. Total clearance of PrPSc was observed in imatinib treated cells. (C) ScN2a cells were either mock-treated (control, lane 1), treated with 100 mM trehalose (lane 2), or treated with 0.2 μM rapamycin were resuspended in 100 μl RIPA buffer (lane 3) for 48 h. Cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-LC3 mAb. (D) Levels of endogenous (0.5% Triton X-100; 0.5% DOC; in LC3-II in trehalose- and rapamycin-treated cells are expressed as percentage of control and represent the PBS) with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Both trehalose (~7-fold) and rapamycin (~3-fold) increase (SDS) and boiled for 10 min. The pellet the level of endogenous LC3-II. fraction was diluted with 900 μl RIPA buffer (supplemented with 1% sarcosyl) inhibitors (0.5 mM Pefabloc) and directly precipitated with meth- and the primary antibody A7 (1:300) was incubated overnight at anol. The sample without PK treatment was directly supplemented 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added for 60 min at 4°C. with proteinase inhibitors and precipitated with methanol. After The immuno-adsorbed proteins were washed in cold RIPA buffer centrifugation for 30 min at 2,000 xg (4°C), the pellets were supplemented with 1% SDS, deglycosylated with PNGaseF at 37°C, re-dissolved in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Animal studies. Intraperitoneal infections of mice were performed NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and gel loading buffer (7% SDS, 30% glycerine, 20% Et-SH, 0.01% Bromphenol blue in 90 mM Tris-HCl as previously described.44 Trehalose or the control disaccharide pH 6.8) was added. After boiling for 5 min an aliquot was analyzed sucrose was thereafter continuously administered as 4% solutions on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvi- via the drinking water (ad libitum). Spleens of individual mice were nylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham). Membranes analyzed in immunoblot at different time points for PrPSc and incuwere blocked with nonfat dry milk (5%) in Tris-buffered saline bation times to clinical prion infection monitored as described.44 Trypan blue assay. To assess viability of cells upon 100 mM treha(TBST) (0.05% Tween 20, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.8), incubated overnight with the appropriate antibody at 4°C and lose treatment, trypan blue assay was performed. Thereby, treatment stained using enhanced chemiluminiscence blotting (ECL plus) kit of cells with trypan blue allows detection of the number of viable cells by staining unviable cells. Cells were cultured for 48, 72 or 96 from Amersham. Transfection of siRNA. siRNA oligonucleotides were from h in medium containing 100 mM trehalose or no trehalose. Then, Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Transfection of siRNA was performed cells were mixed in an 1:2 ratio with trypan blue and subsequently with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocol provided by the stained and unstained cells were counted.

was calculated by determining the ratio of unstained (viable) cells to stained (not viable) and unstained cells. In each experiment at least 600 cells were counted. Statistical analysis. Quantification of immunoblot signals was done by means of the ImageQuant Program (Image Quant Analysis, Molecular Dynamics). Statistical analysis was performed with Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, California) using the unpaired two-tailed t test for pairwise comparisons. Statistical significance was expressed as follows: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 (ns: not significant). LC3-II was measured relative to actin signals to determine endogenous LC3-II levels.
