Two-Photon Permeabilization and Calcium Measurements in Cellular Organelles
Oleg Gerasimenko and Julia Gerasimenko
Abstract
Inositol trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose, main intracellular Ca2+ messengers, induce release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores via inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, respectively. Recently, studies using novel messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) releasing Ca2+ from calcium stores in organelles other than endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been conducted. However, technical difﬁculties of Ca2+ measurements in relatively small Ca2+ stores prompted us to develop a new, more sensitive, and less damaging two-photon permeabilization technique. Applied to pancreatic acinar cells, this technique allowed us to show that all three messengers – IP3 , cADPR, and NAADP – release Ca2+ from two intracellular stores: the endoplasmic reticulum and an acidic store in the granular region. This chapter describes a detailed procedure of using this technique with pancreatic acinar cells. Key words: Ca2+ stores, Ins(1,4,5)P3 , Ryanodine, Pancreas and pancreatic cells, Two-photon permeabilization, Secretory granules.

1. Introduction
Hormone induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores into the cytosol (1) and intracellular Ca2+ -releasing messenger inositol (1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) are the most important discoveries in the Ca2+ signaling ﬁeld (2, 3). IP3 -induced Ca2+ release is currently accepted as the principal mechanism for generation of Ca2+ signals in non-excitable cells (4, 5). While it is generally accepted that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main organelle for Ca2+ release (6, 4, 7–9), other organelles can also serve as a possible Ca2+ store. Several candidates have been suggested

including the mitochondria, which play an important role in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals (10–13). Other organelles such as the nuclear envelope (14–19), the Golgi apparatus (20–22), the secretory granules (23–26), and the endosomes (27) have been reported to store and release Ca2+ . In pancreatic acinar cells, the bulk of the ER Ca2+ store is located in the basal part of the cell (28) with thin ER projections into the secretory granule area (29) where Ca2+ release is usually initiated (30). Application of intracellular Ca2+ messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) or cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) produces Ca2+ release speciﬁcally localized in the secretory granular area (30, 31), including novel Ca2+ releasing messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (32–35). Several hypotheses explaining possible mechanisms of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release have been suggested recently (36–39). To study effects of intracellular Ca2+ messengers, researchers have to use permeabilized cells which are of particular importance for studies of internal stores (2, 3). Chemical permeabilization often damages intracellular membranes and makes it difﬁcult to detect other stores apart from the largest ER. We have tried several permeabilizing agents (digitonin, saponin, streptolysin) until we came up with the idea to use two-photon laser approach (40, 41) for permanent cellular permeabilization (42). This method is much less damaging than chemical permeabilizations. Permeabilization has been achieved by localized perforation of the membrane using two-photon (tuned to 740– 750 nm) high intensity laser pulses. Two-photon light when directed to a small area of cell membrane can perforate plasma membrane allowing successful intracellular delivery of foreign DNA (41). We have modiﬁed this technique to achieve permanent permeabilization of pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 12.1a–d). The result of permeabilization is the hole of approximately 2 m in size, with most of plasma membrane and intracellular organelles intact. We have studied Ca2+ release elicited by the intracellular Ca2+ releasing messengers NAADP, cADPR, and IP3 and found that all three messengers can release Ca2+ from two separate internal stores: thapsigargin-sensitive (ER type) store and thapsigargininsensitive acidic Ca2+ store (Fig. 12.2) (42, 43). With the help of two-photon permeabilization technique we have shown that in both stores NAADP and cADPR likely activate RyRs, whereas IP3 activates IP3 Rs. The use of antibodies and/or large proteins also allowed us to modulate speciﬁc intracellular function(s) (Fig. 12.3). This technique serves as a reliable and convenient method to permeabilize cells with the minimal damage to cellular membranes and organelles.

3. Methods
3.1. Cell Preparation

1. Isolate mouse pancreatic acinar cells by collagenase digestion as described previously (29) (using schedule 1 procedure for handling CD1 mice, according to Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act). Brieﬂy, inject extracted pancreas with 1 mL of collagenase solution, place it in 1.5 mL eppendorf tube, and incubate 15 min in a water-bath at 37◦ C. 2. Dissociate cells by pipetting through a large diameter tip (cut tip end if necessary). 3. Collect cells in a separate tube ﬁlled with buffer I. 4. Centrifuge cells for 1 min at 100×g using swing rotor at room temperature. 5. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of buffer I, add about 10 mL of the same buffer, and wash cells by pipetting several times. 6. Centrifuge cells for 1 min at 100×g using swing rotor at room temperature. 7. Resuspend cells in 2 mL of buffer I. 8. Prepare stock of indicator dye for cell loading by desiccation of Mag Fura-2AM or Fluo-5 N AM in DMSO in concentration of 2 mM according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). 9. After isolation, load cells with low afﬁnity Ca2+ -sensitive dyes: Mag Fura-2 AM (5 M) or Fluo-5 N AM (5 M) by adding an aliquot (5 L to 2 mL of cells) of concentrated stock and incubate for 30–45 min at 37◦ C in water-bath. 10. Centrifuge for 1 min at 100×g using swing rotor at room temperature. Resuspend cells in 2 mL of buffer I.

3.2. Two-Photon Permeabilization

1. Place 200 L of cells on poly-L-lysine-coated cover slips attached to perfusion chamber under the microscope. Perform all experiments at room temperature. Prior to permeabilization, perfuse the cells with buffer II (K+ rich, low Ca2+ , containing EGTA). 2. Stain cell membrane with the “near-membrane” Ca2+ indicator FFP-18 (K+ salt) (1 M) for 5 min to help the formation of a single, site-speciﬁc perforation in the cell membrane using the two-photon laser beam. 3. Apply a high intensity two-photon laser beam in pulse mode at 740–750 nm from Spectra-Physics (8 W Millennia femtosecond laser) to a small area of the cell membrane

(Fig. 12.1a) (see Note 1). This results in heating of this small membrane area and subsequent hole formation. 4. Permeabilization can be conﬁrmed by monitoring the ﬂuorescence of Texas Red dextran added to the extracellular medium. Upon permeabilization Texas Red dextran penetrates into the cytoplasm of targeted cell (Fig. 12.1b). 5. After permeabilization, perfuse cells with intracellular solution (buffer II) for 5–10 min to wash out the cytosolic component of the ﬂuorescent dye (see Note 3): Experiments shown in Fig. 12.1 were conducted in the same solution as above except that CaCl2 was reduced to 0.05 mM. 6. Observe washing of Texas Red dextran from the extracellular solution, which conﬁrms successful and stable permeabilization (Fig. 12.1c). 7. After perforation, cells should be able to respond to intracellular Ca2+ releasing messengers IP3 , NAADP, or cADPR, (Fig. 12.1e–g).
3.3. Fluorescent [Ca2+ ] Measurements

1. Acquire ﬂuorescent images using the Leica SP2 MP twophoton confocal microscope with objective 63× NA 1.2. 2. Excitation and emission wavelengths for Mag Fura-2 are 430 nm (2–5% power) and 460–590 nm, respectively. Alternatively, for excitation of Mag Fura-2 use the two-photon wavelength ∼745 nm. 3. Excitation and emission wavelengths for Fluo-5 N are 488 nm (Argon Ion laser, 1–2% power) and 510–590 nm, respectively. 4. Collect ﬂuorescent images with a frequency of 0.6–1.0 frame/s. 5. Excitation and emission wavelengths for Texas Red dextran are 543 nm and 580–650 nm, respectively. 6. Calculate free Ca2+ concentrations assuming that the K d of Fluo-5 N for Ca2+ is 90 M (see Note 4). 7. Perform the calibration procedure by applying ionomycin (10 M) and nigericin (7 M) with 2 mM EGTA or 10 mM CaCl2 . 8. Perform statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel software. Determine P values for statistical signiﬁcance between sets of data using Student’s t-test.

3.4. Conclusions

We compared responses to the messengers in cells permeabilized by two-photon light with responses obtained from saponin (as well as digitonin and streptolysin) permeabilized acinar cells. We found that two-photon permeabilization has two principal advantages, namely better preserved morphology (including polarity)

and responsiveness. The amplitudes of the responses to IP3 were approximately 1.5 times higher in the two-photon permeabilized cells than in cells permeabilized by saponin (even more difference for digitonin and streptolysin). Two-photon permeabilization resulted in a formation of a hole with a diameter of ˜2 m at any site selected on the surface of the cell. This hole did not close after permeabilization, as in previously published work (41), perhaps due to the larger size and/or the exposure of the cell to an intracellular solution before the two-photon pulse. The success rate with two-photon permeabilization was high (>50%) and we propose this technique as a reliable and convenient method for studies of intracellular stores and organelles.

4. Notes
1. The choice of permeabilization region on cell membrane should be preferably away from the bulk of the ER. Permeabilization can damage not only plasma membrane but also intracellular membranes and organelles which potentially can cause the dramatic loss of Ca2+ . In our experiments best results were obtained by placing target of laser beam near granular area (Fig. 12.1a). 2. Concentration of ATP can be increased to 3 mM to ensure high activity of SERCA pumps. 3. Permeabilizations were conducted at ﬁrst in buffer II with calcium concentration (0.075 mM CaCl2 ) and then before experiment calcium was reduced (by perfusion with buffer II containing 0.05 mM CaCl2 ). 4. The pH-dependence of the Kd of Fluo-5 N for Ca2+ was tested. There was no signiﬁcant difference between the results at pH 7.2 and at pH 6 (27).
