Abstract Polytene interphase chromosomes are compacted into a series of bands and interbands reflecting their organization into independent chromosomal domains. In order to understand chromosomal organization, we set out to study the role of proteins that are selective for interbands. Here we describe the Drosophila melanogaster chromodomain protein Chriz that is coimmunoprecipitated with the zinc finger protein Z4. Both proteins colocalize exclusively to the interbands on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. Like Z4, Chriz is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and is associated with chromatin in all interphase nuclei. Following dissociation from chromatin, early in mitosis Chriz binds to the centrosomes and to the mitotic spindle. Newly induced amorphic Chriz alleles are early lethal, and ubiquitous overexpression of Chriz is lethal as well. Available Chriz hypomorphs which survive until pupal stage have a normal chromosomal phenotype. Reducing Z4 protein does not affect Chriz binding to polytene chromosomes and vice versa. Z4 is still chromosomally bound when Chriz protein is depleted by RNA interference.

Introduction
Eukaryotic chromatin is organized into independent functional units called chromosomal domains. Topological closed domains were demonstrated by biochemical methods (Benyajati and Worcel 1976; Igo-Kemenes and Zachau 1978) and were suggested by the cytology of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (Paulson and Laemmli 1977; Callan 1987). Similarly, the banded structure of polytene interphase chromosomes is interpreted as evidence for looped domains. In Drosophila larvae, like in many other insects, polytene chromosomes result from endoreplication cycles when the replicated chromatids do not separate by mitosis but remain closely associated by homolog pairing. As a consequence, interphase chromosome organization becomes apparent where phase dark bands are separated by phase light interbands, resulting in a species-specific banding pattern. A similar pattern of bands is consistently observed in all polytene tissues down to the lowest level of polyteny amenable to cytological analysis. Thus, the band/interband pattern reflects a common structural organization of interphase chromosomes in general. Each band/interband unit in Drosophila melanogaster contains, on average, 60 kb DNA and is considered to reflect a chromosomal domain. The bands constitute the bulk of the domain including one or several transcription units. Bands may show a dynamic behavior due to the transcriptional activity of their resident genes. For instance, the D. melanogaster heat shock locus in band 87A7 decondenses into a large puff following an increase in temperature to 37°C and similar change in structure can be observed for many ecdysone regulated genes. In contrast, our knowledge on interbands is limited and several different views were proposed for interband function. Using various sources and methods, various groups estimated the amount of interband DNA between 1% and 25% of total DNA (reviewed in Zhimulev 1996). Although the interbands contain less DNA, bands and interbands comprise roughly the same length, indicating differences in packing ratios. By cytophotometry and high-resolution in situ hybridization data, the DNA packaging ratio in bands

was determined as 60- to 100-fold and that of interbands to about 5- to 8-fold (Beermann 1972; Rykowski et al. 1988). Thus, interband chromatin structure is likely a 10-nm nucleosome fiber, whereas chromatin in bands is condensed at least into 30-nm fibers (Rykowski et al. 1988). Due to their decompacted state, interbands have long been hypothesized as the sites of transcriptional activity and nascent RNA molecules as well as RNA polymerase II were localized to interbands (Zhimulev and Belyaeva 1975; Semeshin et al. 1979; Plagens et al. 1976; Sass 1982; Sass and Bautz 1982). However, the total length of interbands has insufficient coding capacity and in many cases transcription units were localized to bands. Moreover, selective staining of the active elongating form of RNA polymerase II is restricted to puffs and minipuffs (Weeks et al. 1993; Gerber et al. 2001), unlike the more general puff and interband staining observed earlier (Plagens et al. 1976). Alternatively, interbands were considered to contain the regulatory regions and transcription initiation sites of genes located in adjacent bands. Supporting this view, Rykowski et al. (1988) demonstrated that the Notch transcribed region is located within the band 3C7 and the Notch promoter and the upstream regulatory regions are contained within the 3C6-C7 interband. Intuitively, the difference in compaction between bands and interbands suggests the existence of boundaries between the two elements. The chromosomal binding of boundary element proteins in interbands and the mapping of regulatory elements suggest that interbands indeed provide boundaries of chromosomal domains. The heat shock locus at 87A7 contains two divergently transcribed hsp70 genes that are flanked by specialized chromatin structure elements scs and scs′, respectively (Udvardy et al. 1985). Both elements confer position-independent expression on Drosophila transgenes and are functional as enhancer blockers in transgene expression (Kellum and Schedl 1991, 1992). Boundary elements with similar properties have been localized to the interband 3C6-3C7 preceding the Notch locus (Vazquez and Schedl 2000). The scs′ activity is mediated by the Boundary Element Associated Factor 32 (BEAF-32A, B; Zhao et al. 1995; Hart et al. 1997). The BEAF-32 proteins are localized at numerous interbands on polytene chromosomes and their suggested boundary function at these sites has been proven in some cases (Cuvier et al. 1998). To learn more about the formation of interbands and chromosomal boundaries, a study of interband proteins and their mutual interactions with the corresponding genomic DNA sequences is urgently required. At present, data accurately matching the DNA sequences from the Drosophila genome project with the cytology of polytene chromosomes are rather limited. The 3C6-7 is the only example of an interband mapped at a molecular level (Rykowski et al. 1988 and references therein). Detailed knowledge on interband proteins is a prerequisite to understand interband structure and function, and antibodies to such proteins would provide useful handles to isolate interband sequences by ChIP analysis. Besides the BEAF32 isoforms A, B, only a few interband-specific proteins are known so far. The tandem kinase Jil-1, besides its function in dosage compen-

sation, plays a role in the maintenance of interbands, since removing Jil-1 function resulted in highly compacted polytene chromosomes lacking any banded appearance (Jin et al. 1999, 2000). The Brahma complex localizes to puffs and many interbands (Armstrong et al. 2002; Mohrmann et al. 2004), but its role in interband formation is not known. We recently described the Z4 protein as an interbandspecific zinc finger protein, which is involved in the establishment or maintenance of the alternating band/interband pattern. Reduction of the amount of Z4 results in a progressive disintegration of the banded structure of polytene chromosomes. However, in contrast to Jil-1, Z4 mutant chromosomes were not compacted but had lost their banded organization and had a cloudy decompacted appearance (Eggert et al. 2004). To identify potential interacting partners of Z4, coimmunoprecipitation with a Z4-specific antibody was carried out, and a chromodomain protein with an apparent molecular weight of about 140 kDa was identified—which we named Chriz, for Chromodomain protein interacting with Z4 (Eggert et al. 2004). The chromodomain is a conserved motif found in many nuclear proteins involved in chromatin organization from yeast to humans. This paper describes the results of our molecular and cytogenetic analysis of the interband-specific protein Chriz.

Materials and methods
Drosophila stocks and genetics Fly stocks were kept on standard Drosophila cornmeal– molasses medium at 25°C unless otherwise indicated. Oregon-R was used as a wild-type stock. The KG6256 and KG3258 stocks were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. H. Bellen (Bellen et al. 2004), sh044 and Df(3L)79E-F were kindly provided by Dr. S. Oh (Oh et al. 2003) and Dr. Ruohola-Baker (Clegg et al. 1997), respectively, whereas all other stocks were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center. T80-GAL4 (Wilder and Perrimon 1995), Act-GAL4 (Ito et al. 1997) and Da-GAL4 (Wodarz et al. 1995) transgene lines were used to drive the ubiquitous expression of UAS transgenes. G14.1–GAL4 is a salivary gland-specific GAL4 driver, which is active in gland secretion epithelia from stage 12 of embryo development into pupal stages (Dr. U. Hinz, Köln). Sgs3-GAL4 (Cherbas et al. 2002) drives expression in salivary glands of mid-third instar larvae. Genetic markers and balancers not described in this work can be found in FlyBase (The FlyBase Consortium 2003) and in Lindsley and Zimm (1992). Drosophila species (D. mauritiana, D. erecta, and D. takahashii) used for the comparative molecular evolutionary analysis were kept in the laboratory at Novosibirsk for a long time. The excision of P{SUPor-P} (Roseman et al. 1995) and P{lacW} (Bier et al. 1989) transposons was induced by crossing to a transposase stock w1118; CyO/Sp; PΔ2-3, Sb ry506/TM6, Ubx. White-eyed F2 males were collected and crossed individually to the y w; CyO/If; MKRS, Sb/ TM6B, Tb, Hu females; then their progeny were established

as balanced stocks and further tested for the reversion and lethality. A stock bearing the insertion of the pWR-gChriz transposon (see below) on the second chromosome was used for the rescue experiments. Molecular procedures All molecular procedures were performed essentially as previously described (Sambrook and Russell 2001). All DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Sequencing was done on the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). RNA from different developmental stages was isolated using Trizol (Gibco BRL). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using MicroPoly(A)Purist mRNA Purification Kit (Ambion), and subjected to Northern blot analysis with DNA probes prepared from the GH27095 cDNA clone and the rp49 sequence present in pHR0.6 (O’Connell and Rosbash 1984). Primer sequences used for the amplification of Chriz genomic sequences in different Drosophila species are available upon request. Constructs for transformations A 7.1-kb genomic ScaI–EcoRI fragment encompassing the entire Chriz gene and a partial sequence of the neighboring SslI gene (Fig. 1b) was cloned from the RP98-48E5 BAC clone (Hoskins et al. 2000) into pBluescript cut with EcoRV and EcoRI. The cloned insert was excised with KpnI and SpeI, and subcloned into similarly cut Drosophila transformation vector pWhiteRabbit (aÃkind gift from N. Brown) Â to yield a P WR:wþmC ; Chrizþt7:1 transposon (designated as pWR-gChriz).

The Chriz protein coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 27–926 was PCR amplified from the cDNA clone GH27095 (available from Invitrogen) with primers ChrFNot 5′-TAGGGCGGCCGCGACGTTCTTGTATGTG GACG-3′ and ChrR0 5′-GCTCTAGATTACGTTGGGATG TTGAGCGTC-3′ and placed in pBluescriptII/EcoRV to obtain pBlue-Chriz. Then it was reexcised as a NotI–SalI fragment from pBlue-Chriz and cloned into Drosophila transformation vector pUAST-myc-his (J. Kaltenhäuser, H. Eggert, unpublished data) cut with NotI and XhoI. Thus, Chriz CDS was inserted downstream to and in-frame with the sequences coding for two epitope tags, 6xHis, and 3xMyc, under control of the UAS elements of pUAST (Brand and Perrimon 1993). Upon transformation in the y1w1 host strain, several homozygous viable transgenic lines with autosomal insertions of the P[w+mW.hs, UASGALhsp70:3xmyc6xhis-Chriz+2.7] transposon (designated as pUAST-myc-hisChriz) were established. To obtain Chriz-dsRNAi construct, we first cloned a 927bp BamHI fragment from pBlue-Chriz into the BglII site of pEFGP-1. Then we introduced a 1.3-kb SacI–SacII fragment (antisense orientation) from pBlue-Chriz into the construct made to obtain pEGFP-Chriz-dsRNAi. The 2.2kb EcoRI fragment from pEGFP-Chriz-dsRNAi was subsequently placed into the EcoRI site of pUAST. The resulting transposon P[UAS-Chriz-dsRNAi] was used to transform flies, and a stock with an insert on the third chromosome was established. Antibodies and immunocytochemistry Polyclonal Chriz-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits using the C-terminal half of Chriz (345–926 aa), cloned as a BamHI–SalI fragment from pBlue-Chriz into similarly cut pQE30a (Qiagen) to generate 6xHis-Chriz (345–926) fusion. The fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) E.

Images were taken using appropriate filter combinations with a Zeiss Axiophot equipped with a high-performance CCD camera.

Results
Identification and sequence analysis of Chriz In our previous analysis of the interband-specific Zn-finger protein Z4 (Eggert et al. 2004), we found that Z4 coimmunoprecipitates several polypeptides, most prominently a protein of an apparent mass of 140 kDa. This protein band

was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and peptide mass maps were searched in a nonredundant database in FASTA format as described previously (Reim et al. 1999). Nineteen (41%) of 46 peptides could be matched with an ORF of a putative gene CG10712 from the Drosophila genome database which corresponds to a total sequence coverage of 27%. In order to prove that we isolated the cognate Z4 interaction partner, CG10712 cDNAwas cloned in frame to a myc-his-tag in the pUAST transformation vector (see Materials and methods). On expression in salivary glands using a Sgs3-Gal4 driver line, the tagged fusion protein was localized exclusively in the interbands of polytene chromosomes (Eggert et al. 2004). This pattern perfectly matches that of the Z4 antigen (Eggert et al. 2004), demonstrating that the CG10712 encodes the desired protein that interacts and colocalizes with Z4 in vivo. We therefore named this gene Chriz (Eggert et al. 2004). Chriz is a single copy gene located in 79F on chromosome 3L close to the centromeric heterochromatin. The gene has three transcriptional start sites, alternative usage of the first intron, and two different polyadenylation sites that are ∼0.6 kb apart (Fig. 1; compare FlyBase). The 5′-most start site should result in the expression of a ∼3.8-kb transcript. In addition, there are two internal start sites 92 bp apart from each other that would result in two ∼3.8-kb

transcripts. The alternative polyadenylation site would result in two classes of transcripts differing by 0.6 kb. However, all mRNAs encode the same protein of 926 amino acids with the calculated molecular weight of 101 kDa. Apart from an overrepresentation of glutamine (1.78×) and an underrepresentation of cysteine (0.2×), phenylalanine (0.4×) and tyrosine (0.3×) residues, the amino acid composition of Chriz is that of an average Drosophila protein (Smoller et al. 1990). Blast searches in protein databases (Altschul et al. 1997) revealed a chromodomain, an evolutionary conserved protein module of about 50 amino acids, in the N-terminal part of Chriz (Fig. 2; Paro and Hogness 1991). Chromodomaincontaining proteins are widespread among eukaryotes. D. melanogaster contains 17 proteins with chromodomains (Rubin et al. 2000). It was demonstrated that chromodomains of Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and Polycomb (PC) mediate the specific recognition of methylated lysine residues K9 and K27 of histone H3, respectively (Nielsen et al. 2002; Fischle et al. 2003). Comparison of the Chriz chromodomain sequence with those of HP1 and PC reveals significant conservation in residues that define the spatial organization characteristic of the chromodomain module (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, two out of the three aromatic residues in chromodomain of HP1/PC that were identified to be

60

crucial for the recognition of histone H3 di- and trimethyllysine are substituted in the chromodomain of Chriz for charged amino acids. In protein database searches for other potentially conserved Chriz domains, we failed to identify significant homology outside the chromodomain region. Although the protein is exclusively nuclear (see below), no consensus NLS was detected. Since domains important for function often retain their structure in more closely related species, we compared the Chriz coding sequence in different dipteran species. Following PCR amplification we sequenced the Chriz gene from D. mauritiana, D. erecta, and D. takahashii (GenBank accession numbers AY273293–AY273295) and compared it with its sequences recently available for D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. virilis, D. pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae. Comparison of the deduced Chriz amino acid sequences allowed us to identify three conserved regions in addition to the chromodomain (aa 208–279): (1) an aminoterminal region (aa 1–186), (2) a strongly conserved domain (aa 703–802) and (3) a carboxyterminal region (880–

926). In addition, there were regions whose positive charge (503–621) or negative charge (771–898) was conserved in general between the species (Fig. 2). Chriz is ubiquitously expressed Expression of Chriz is shown in Fig. 3a on a developmental Northern blot. The Chriz RNA is expressed at all stages of development, with a more pronounced expression in embryos and in adult females (see also Arbeitman et al. 2002). The Chriz messages of ∼3.8 and ∼3.2 kb correspond to the two alternately polyadenylated products. The 3.2-kb transcript is more prominent in females and embryos and may be maternally transmitted. Following expression of Chriz in bacteria, specific rabbit antisera were raised. On Western blots using Kc cell nuclear proteins, both antisera detect a minor band of 150 kDa and a major band of 140 kDa (Fig. 3b). Both are larger than expected from the predicted molecular weight of the Chriz

protein. Since all possible splice forms suggest only a single ORF, the two forms may represent posttranslational modifications. The same two proteins are present in Kc cells and in embryo, larval and adult stages (Fig. 3b). In contrast to Chriz RNA, the protein is not upregulated in embryos and adult females. On immunostaining Chriz is detected as a nuclear protein in all tissues and organs tested so far. In the Drosophila cell line Kc, nuclei are stained in a speckled pattern distinct from that of the condensed DNA (Fig. 4a–c). This pattern is also unlike the speckled distribution previously described for the hnRNPs (Fig. 4d–f). In cleavage stage embryos, in addition to the nuclear labelling, considerable staining is found in the cytoplasmic islands surrounding the nuclei (Fig. 5a). At syncytial blastoderm and later stages the bulk of the protein is present in speckles inside the nuclei, which do not coincide with condensed chromatin. This is most obvious in the apical heterochromatic chromocenter, which is not stained by Chriz antibodies (Fig. 5b). There is no indication for lineage- or tissue-specific staining at these and later stages (data not shown). Similarly, there is staining of all nuclei in imaginal rings, imaginal discs, in brain and ovaries with no indication for tissue specificity (Fig. 4g–h and data not shown). In early embryos the nuclear localization of Chriz during mitosis is easily observed. During syncytial blastoderm stages its distribution can be observed on mitotic gradients formed in the embryo (Fig. 5c). During prophase Chriz starts dissociating from chromosomes and in metaphase it is mainly present within the nuclear cage with the condensed mitotic chromosomes largely devoid of Chriz (Fig. 5e, f). Other nuclear proteins are detected on metaphase chromosomes using the same fixation conditions (Frasch et al. 1986). Interestingly, starting at prophase Chriz protein is detected at the centrosomes that organize the mitotic spindle outside the nuclei. In early anaphase, when the nuclear envelope is disintegrated (Paddy et al. 1996), Chriz associates with the mitotic spindle (Fig. 5g). Later in anaphase it is still prominent in the spindle region and it begins to accumulate in nuclei at telophase. A similar mitotic distribution was reported by Rath et al. (2004), who identified the same protein by its interaction with the spindle protein Skeletor (see Discussion). The Z4 protein described previously (Eggert et al. 2004) exhibits a very similar distribution during mitosis (data not shown). Chriz colocalizes with Z4 in interbands Chriz is detected in many interbands on polytene chromosomes when stained with specific antisera (Fig. 6a–d). However, we note that some interbands do not contain this protein. Certain telomeres, like those of chromosome 2L and the X chromosome, appear more strongly stained (Fig. 6b, c). However, Chriz is absent from bands and it is also largely absent from decondensed puffs. The latter observation is inconsistent with simple models that Chriz binding is a consequence of chromosome decondensation. Chriz is not found at pericentric heterochromatin and the

chromocenter core (Fig. 6f), where histone H3 mono-, diand trimethylated at lysine 9 and 27, respectively were observed (Ebert et al. 2004). Following coimmunostaining with Z4 antibodies and anti-Chriz antisera, it is demonstrated that both proteins essentially colocalize on polytene chromosomes (Fig. 6e). The heat shock region in 87AC was investigated for the presence of Chriz protein before and after 30 min heat shock induction at 37°C (Fig. 7). The puffs at 87A7 and 87C were not stained by the Chriz antibody. Yet, although the interbands in the vicinity of the puff are distorted by breaking up the polytene chromosomes into chromatin bundles, the staining of the Chriz protein is still localized at the flanks of both puffs (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, the heat shock puff 87A7 at its distal border shows significant Chriz binding and less binding at its proximal border, similar to the binding reported for the boundary element-associated factor BEAF 32 (Zhao et al. 1995). The heat shock puff forming at 87C is flanked by a Chriz binding site on its proximal site only (Fig. 7b). Chriz is essentially required for development The ubiquitous overexpression of Chriz under the control of act-Gal4 and T80-Gal4 driver lines is early larval lethal. Da-Gal4 driven expression is semilethal and results in female sterility. Using different driver lines with a more restricted GAL4 expression pattern, organ- and tissue-

specific defects were observed indicating that a defined dosage of Chriz is essential for normal development (data not shown). We obtained three independent stocks with P transposons integrated into the Chriz region (Fig. 1b; The FlyBase Consortium 2003; Bellen et al. 2004). In KG6256 stock the P{SUPor-P} transposon was reported to be inserted 38 bp upstream of the first Chriz transcription start site. Flies homozygous for the KG6256-bearing chromosome normally die at the larval stage, but when cultivated at 16°C, rare adult escapers can be observed. In KG3258, the P{SUPor-P} transposon inserted into the Chriz first intron, 30 bp upstream of the second major transcription start site (Bellen et al. 2004). This insertion is homozygous embryonic lethal with rare first instar larvae escapers. Intriguingly, the P{lacW} insertion sh044 (Oh et al. 2003) that occurred in exactly the same position as in KG3258 is homozygous viable, and displays a female sterile phenotype. This might be attributed to the smaller size of the P{lacW} transposon, and the fact that it lacks the Su(Hw) binding sites present in P{SUPor-P}, which might interfere with proper promoter activity. To prove that the phenotype observed was a result of the insertions of the transposons into the Chriz gene, we performed standard P-element excision crosses. In all three

cases, we obtained numerous independent phenotypic revertant lines demonstrating that the lethality or sterility was induced by the corresponding P element insertions. Imprecise P-element excision events were registered as well, and in the same experiment we isolated 14 independent mutants that failed to complement each other and the original insertion strains. Furthermore, by complementation crosses we found that Chriz was uncovered by the deficiences Df (3L)79E-F and Df(3L)Delta1AK (79E5/F1–79F2/F6), but not by a more distal deficiency Df(3L)HD1 (79D3/E1– 79F3/6). This places the Chriz gene into the chromosomal region 79F3-6 in contrast to the data in the FlyBase that locate Chriz at 80B2. According to the results of the interallelic and deficiency complementation, of 14 new Chriz alleles obtained by imprecise excision 11 are amorphic alleles and three are hypomorphs of various strength (Table 1). The breakpoints of the genomic aberrations in the most severe Chriz alleles were determined by Southern blotting and by sequencing the Chriz genomic region of the corresponding mutants (Fig. 1; Table 1). To exclude lethal hits unrelated to Chriz in the mutant stocks, complementation with a transgenic strain containing the 7.1-kb ScaI–EcoRI genomic fragment (Fig. 1) was carried out. The transgene contains Chriz and parts of the flanking genes and rescues most of the Chriz alleles. HowRescue by genomic clone Yes Allelic class

ever, the alleles ChrizÁKG10 ; ChrizÁKG20 ; ChrizÁKG30 ; and ChrizÁKG39 failed to be complemented by an ectopic Chriz copy. In fact, both ChrizÁKG10 and ChrizÁKG20 deletions not only removed the first transcription start site and the first exon of Chriz, they also affected the 5′-UTR of the neighboring Ssl1 gene (Fig. 1; Table 1). Since our data demonstrate that ChrizÁKG10 ; ChrizÁKG20 ; ChrizÁKG30 and ChrizÁKG39 affect genes in addition to Chriz, these lines were not considered any further. As indicated in Fig. 1, the ChrizÁKG12 and ChrizÁKG65 amorphic alleles leave the first transcription start site for Chriz intact, but completely remove the sequences comprising the second Chriz transcription start, Àalong with Áthe translation starting site up to the last 237 aa ChrizÁKG12 or À Á 630 aa, respectively ChrizÁKG65 . In neither case were sequences corresponding to the chromodomain retained. Therefore, we consider these alleles as null alleles.

Z4 and Chriz are largely independent of each other for chromosomal binding The coimmunoprecipitation of Chriz with Z4 and the precise colocalization in diploid nuclei and polytene chromosomes suggest that both proteins bind to each other or that they occur in a common complex together with other proteins. However, the direct interaction between the two proteins when tested in the yeast two-hybrid system and by GST pulldown was rather weak (data not shown). To test whether the chromosomal binding of Z4 was dependent on Chriz, we used Chriz RNAi-induced knockdown driven by the G14.2-Gal4 driver line, which is specifically expressed in salivary glands (Fig. 8a, b). As shown in Fig. 8b, Chriz staining gives a strongly reduced signal on polytene chromosomes of these animals compared to its normal staining as seen in Fig 8c. However, although reduced, Chriz protein is still present in interbands. In contrast, the Z4 staining in interbands of such animals is similar to that in wild-type (Fig. 8a). We conclude that the chromosomal binding of Z4 is not exclusively dependent on Chriz. Conversely, animals heterozygous for the hypomorphic allele Z4-7.1 and the null-allele Z4-1.3 (Eggert et al. 2004) show a strongly reduced staining with Z4 antibodies (Fig. 8c) compared to the normal staining (Fig. 8a), but staining with anti-Chriz antisera is similar to that in wild-type (Fig. 8c; note that the images for Z4 in Fig. 8a, d and for Chriz in Fig. 8b, c were taken and reproduced under exactly the same conditions). This demonstrates that chromosomal binding of Chriz does not depend on Z4 either. In conclusion, our data suggest that both proteins colocalize by indirect interaction possibly in a chromatin complex. Reducing the amount of Chriz protein does not induce a chromosomal phenotype Z4 mutant alleles produce a chromosomal phenotype of a progressive loss of polytene chromosome structure at late

third instar larval/early pupal stage (Eggert et al. 2004). Animals homozygous for amorphic Chriz alleles did not survive past first instar larval stage and could not be tested for a chromosomal phenotype. When Chriz was knocked down by induced RNAi in salivary glands, a chromosomal phenotype was not observed even at 29°C. However, although in such animals Chriz protein is strongly reduced it is not completely absent (Fig. 8b). We cannot exclude that the remaining Chriz protein is sufficient to support the structural integrity of polytene chromosomes. Unfortunately, the homozygotes for the available hypomorphic Chriz alleles expressed even more Chriz protein than the RNAi line and consequently also did not exhibit a chromosomal phenotype (not shown).

Discussion
We identified the chromodomain protein Chriz by coimmunoprecipitation in a protein complex with the zinc finger protein Z4. Both proteins colocalize in the nuclei of all Drosophila tissues tested so far and precisely colocalize on polytene interphase chromosomes. Although both proteins are readily coimmunoprecipitated, the observed direct interaction between the two proteins is surprisingly weak in vitro (M. Gan, unpublished data) and both proteins bind to polytene chromosomes largely independent of each other. Thus, we cannot exclude that the interaction between both proteins is indirect and coimmunoprecipitation is mediated by one of the other proteins coimmunoprecipitated with the Z4/Chriz complex. Mass spectrometry allowed the identification of one additional presumptive complex subunit, and it was characterized by immunostaining as an interband-specific protein (A. Gortchakov, unpublished data). Interestingly, the Drosophila homolog of the boundary element binding factor dCTCF (R. Renkawitz, Giessen, personal communication) found in a subset of interbands is coprecipitated with Chriz and Z4. In addition, BEAF32 (Zhao et al. 1995) and Jil-1 (Jin et al. 1999, 2000) colocalize with Chriz and Z4 in many interbands in an overlapping, although not identical, pattern (H. Saumweber, unpublished data). Work is in progress to shed more light on these interactions and their functional relevance. More recently, the same protein was independently identified by Rath et al. (2004), who called this protein Chromator. Chromator was identified because of the interaction of its carboxyterminal domain with Skeletor, an essential component of the mitotic spindle. The authors demonstrated strong binding of this protein to the mitotic spindle and to centrosomes, which was corroborated by our results. They also demonstrated by RNA interference in S2 cells that this protein is involved in spindle organization during mitosis. However, the specific chromosomal binding in diploid cells and on polytene chromosomes and the presence of a chromodomain suggest a function in interphase chromatin as well. Chriz is essential as demonstrated by the isolation of new loss of function alleles and we observed that increasing the dosage of this protein is not tolerated either. Unlike Z4, reducing the dosage of Chriz did not result in a chromosomal phenotype. Neither depletion of the Chriz protein by hypomorphic mutations nor by RNA interference resulted in abnormal chromosome morphology. However, in both cases detectable Chriz protein remained that was bound with the same specificity as in wild-type. Complete loss of Chriz cannot be tested since amorphic alleles are embryo/first larval lethal. It is still not known what mediates the specific binding of Z4 and Chriz to interbands. The zinc finger protein Z4 showed a general affinity for DNA binding and the specificity of pairs of zinc fingers from that protein is currently being tested. Yet, as suggested by our results, Z4 alone does not determine the specific chromosomal targeting of Chriz. On the other hand, DNA binding of Chriz has not been studied; however, with the exception of dMi-2 (Bouazoune

et al. 2002), chromodomain-containing proteins were not shown to bind DNA. Rather, they bind to modified nucleosomes or chromosomal RNA (Akhtar et al. 2000). Experiments are in progress to uncover the domain of Chriz required for chromosomal binding. As first demonstrated for HP1 and PC, chromodomains mediate the binding to methylated histones (Nielsen et al. 2002; Fischle et al. 2003). HP1 binds di- and trimethylated H3K9 and PC binds di- and trimethylated H3K27 and/or H3K9 (Fischle et al. 2003; Czermin et al. 2002; Ringrose et al. 2004). However, due to the lack of two essential aromatic residues, the Chriz chromodomain may be not involved in binding to di- and trimethylated H3K9 and H3K27; in fact, no binding was observed in the chromocenter core and pericentric chromatin that is rich in these histone modifications (Ebert et al. 2004). Similarly, binding to trimethylated H4K20 (Schotta et al. 2004) is unlikely due to the lack of Chriz staining of pericentric heterochromatin. At present, however, binding of the Chriz chromodomain to other methyl marks on histones cannot be ruled out. In particular, it would be interesting to see if it binds to activating methylation modifications such as methylated H3K4 (Santos-Rosa et al. 2002; Byrd and Shearn 2003). Binding to chromosomal RNA may be considered as an alternative. The MOF and MSL3 components of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex contain a chromodomain that binds to RNA in vitro and is important to target these proteins to many interbands on the X chromosome by formation of complexes with the noncoding roX1 and roX2 RNAs (Akhtar 2003). Having chromodomains with different specificity/affinity to RNAs locally present on chromosomes would provide an attractive alternative targeting mechanism.
