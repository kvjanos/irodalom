There has recently been great interest in using predictive modeling to infer the instantaneous cognitive state of a subject, e.g. viewing an image of a face or reacting to a barking dog in a video game, using only the subject’s fMRI data. Such modeling is typically achieved using machine learning approaches, in which models are trained on fMRI data for which the subject’s cognitive state over time is known and has been labeled. While such approaches have demonstrated that cognitive states can be predicted using fMRI, prediction accuracy can be improved. Also, relatively little eﬀort has been put into translating these predictive models into models of brain dynamics, sparking interest in improving the interpretability of predictive models. In the regression paradigm, a recent technique from bioinformatics, the Elastic Net [2], attempts to address prediction and interpretation concerns using a novel regularization scheme. In addition, this method oﬀers greater ﬂexibility than traditional regression methods, enabling control over model properties. Elastic Net eﬀectively optimizes the functional: L(λ1 , λ2 , β) = ||y − Xβ||2 + λ1 ||β||1 + λ2 ||β||2 , 2 2 (1)

the L1 and L2 norms of the model coeﬃcients, The goal is to achieve the sparse modeling beneﬁts of L1 regularization while using L2 regularization to relax exclusion of correlated predictors, leading to a more accurate model of the underlying data structure. Increasing the L1 regularization leads to more voxels being selected; increasing the L2 regularization leads to more inclusion of correlated voxels.

thus minimizing both the least-squares model error and

We evaluate the Elastic Net for fMRI, focusing on the eﬀects of increasing the L2 regularization on the sparse model properties. Data were obtained from a predictive modeling competition [1]. Noting that voxels nearby in space are frequently correlated, we evaluate the spatial distribution of a model as a proxy for the degree of exclusion of correlated voxels. Our ﬁndings suggest that the most predictive and robust models use highly distributed information while drawing adequately from relevant spatially localized clusters of correlated voxels. These results highlight the non-trivial relationship between localization and distribution in functional brain processing and exemplify the ﬂexibility of the Elastic Net method for controlling model performance and interpretation.
