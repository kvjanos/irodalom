In most cancers, transformation begins in a single cell in an epithelial cell sheet1–3. However, it is not known what happens at the interface between non-transformed (normal) and transformed cells once the initial transformation has occurred. Using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells that express constitutively active, oncogenic Ras (RasV12) in a tetracycline-inducible system, we investigated the cellular processes arising at the interface between normal and transformed cells. We show that two independent phenomena occur in a non-cell-autonomous manner: when surrounded by normal cells, RasV12 cells are either apically extruded from the monolayer, or form dynamic basal protrusions and invade the basal matrix. Neither apical extrusion nor basal protrusion formation is observed when RasV12 cells are surrounded by other RasV12 cells. We show that Cdc42 and ROCK (also known as Rho kinase) have vital roles in these processes. We also demonstrate that E‑cadherin knockdown in normal cells surrounding RasV12 cells reduces the frequency of apical extrusion, while promoting basal protrusion formation and invasion. These results indicate that RasV12-transformed cells are able to recognize differences between normal and transformed cells, and consequently leave epithelial sheets either apically or basally, in a cell-context-dependent manner. Cell transformation arises from the activation of oncoproteins and/or inactivation of tumour suppressor proteins1. During the initial stage of carcinogenesis, transformation occurs in a single cell in an epithelial monolayer 2,3. However, it remains unclear what happens at the interface between normal and transformed cells during this process. For example, do surrounding normal cells recognize the transformation that has occurred in their neighbour? What is the fate of the transformed cell when surrounded by normal cells? To address these questions, we

established MDCK epithelial cells expressing GFP-tagged RasV12 in a tetracycline-inducible manner (MDCK-pTR GFP–RasV12; Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a, b). After addition of tetracycline to cells plated at low density, expression of GFP–RasV12 induced cell scattering and downregulation of cell–cell contacts (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1c)4. In contrast, when cells were plated at high density, expression of GFP–RasV12 did not induce loss of cell–cell adhesion, and cells retained an epithelial morphology (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1d). In all subsequent experiments, we cultured cells at high density. To examine the fate of a single RasV12 cell in a monolayer of normal MDCK cells, MDCK-pTR GFP–RasV12 cells were labelled with fluorescent dye (CMPTX) and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. The combination of cells was then cultured on a collagen matrix in the absence of tetracycline until a monolayer was formed. Subsequently, GFP–RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline, and the fate of RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells was observed using time-lapse microscopy. Between 13 and 25 h after tetracycline addition, RasV12 cells were frequently extruded from the apical surface of the monolayer (84% of tracked cells, n = 74; Fig. 1a; Supplementary Information, Movie 1). We observed that RasV12 cells often underwent cell division before extrusion; however, we also observed extrusion of single RasV12 cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a). After extrusion, RasV12 cells continued to proliferate and form multicellular aggregates (Fig. 1a, c; Supplementary Information, Movie 1). These multicellular structures attached loosely to the underlying normal cells and dynamically moved over them (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2b and Movie 1). Extruded RasV12 cells did not stain with ethidium dye (data not shown), indicating that they remained alive. Treatment with the K+ channel inhibitor 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which blocks the early stage of apoptosis in epithelial cells5, did not appreciably reduce the frequency of extrusion (Fig. 1d), further indicating that extrusion of RasV12 cells occurs in a cell death-independent manner.

Figure 1 Epithelial cells expressing RasV12 are apically extruded from surrounding normal epithelium in a non-cell-autonomous manner. (a, b) RasV12-expressing cells were extruded from a monolayer of normal cells, but not from a monolayer of RasV12-expressing cells. MDCK-pTR GFP– RasV12 cells were combined with normal MDCK cells (a) or MDCK-pTR GFP–RasV12 cells (b) at a ratio of 1:100 and cultured on type-I collagen gels, followed by tetracycline treatment. Images were extracted from a representative time-lapse analysis. Red arrows indicate fluorescently labelled RasV12 cells. (c) Confocal images of xz and xy sections of GFP–RasV12 cells combined with normal MDCK cells (upper panels) or

Cells were fixed after 48 h incubation with (+ Tet, 2 μg ml–1) or without (– Tet) tetracycline and stained with anti-gp135 antibody (cyan) and Hoechst (blue). (d) Quantification of time-lapse analyses of RasV12 cells extruded from a monolayer of normal cells 24 h after tetracycline addition in the absence (control) or presence of 4-AP. Data are mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 98 cells control, n = 101 cells 4-AP). (e) Drosophila wing imaginal disc epithelium co-expressing lacZ and RasV12 or RasN17. Cells were stained with anti-β-galactosidase antibody (green) and Hoechst (blue). Scale bars, 20 μm (a–c, e).

GFP–Rap1V12, a constitutively active form of Ras-related non-oncogenic small GTPase6, were not extruded but remained in the monolayer of normal cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2c, d and Movie 2). In the absence of tetracycline, we did not observe extrusion of RasV12 cells (data not shown). Moreover, fluorescently labelled RasV12 cells were not extruded when mixed with non-labelled RasV12 cells (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Information, Movie 3), suggesting that the extrusion of RasV12 cells depends on their interaction with normal cells. Similarly, fluorescently labelled normal cells were not extruded from a monolayer of normal cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the extrusion of RasV12 cells occurs in a non-cell-autonomous manner only when they are surrounded by normal cells. To examine the physiological relevance of this observation, RasV12 was expressed in a mosaic manner in wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster. RasV12-expressing cells were apically extruded from normal epithelial cell sheets (14%, n = 85; Fig. 1e, left panels), showing that apical extrusion of RasV12-expressing cells occurs in vivo. Cells expressing RasN17, a constitutively inactive form of Ras, or wild-type Ras were not extruded and remained within the disc epithelium (0%, n = 28 or 0%, n = 19;

Fig. 1e, right panels; Supplementary Information, Fig. S3a). When RasV12 was expressed in the entire epithelium, the monolayer became irregularly folded but we did not observe apical extrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3b)7. To understand the molecular mechanism of apical extrusion, we analysed RasV12-expressing MDCK cells that were not yet extruded and remained in the monolayer of normal MDCK cells. We found that the height of RasV12 cells along the apicobasal axis was significantly higher than that of the surrounding normal cells (Fig. 2a, b). When RasV12 cells alone formed a monolayer, the cell height was comparable to that of normal cells (Fig. 2b). These results indicate that the height of RasV12 cells increases in a cell-context-dependent manner. We also observed that phosphorylation of myosin light chain was enhanced in RasV12 cells with increased height (Fig. 2c), but not in those with similar height to surrounding normal cells (data not shown), suggesting a correlation between increased cell height and activation of myosin. Furthermore, we found that F-actin accumulated at cell–cell contacts between RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells (Fig. 2a, d), but not when surrounded by RasV12 cells (Fig. 2d). F-actin did not accumulate between normal

deregulation of E-cadherin in RasV12 cells is not involved in apical extrusion. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of apical extrusion of RasV12 cells, we examined the effect of various inhibitors that modulate cell signalling and/or the cytoskeleton. Among the signalling pathways downstream of active Ras, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI(3)K) pathways are required for Ras-induced transformation8. Addition of U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK kinases, completely suppressed apical extrusion of RasV12 cells, whereas the PI(3)K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect (Fig. 2e, f), suggesting that the MAPK pathway is involved in apical extrusion. As PI(3)K has been shown to have a crucial role in lamellipodia formation9, it is unlikely that apical extrusion is due to increased migration of RasV12 cells. Indeed, we never observed lamellipodia or membrane ruffling of RasV12 cells during or after extrusion (data not shown). Blebbistatin and cytochalasin D, which inhibit myosin-II activity and actin polymerization respectively, significantly suppressed apical extrusion (Fig. 2e, f), as did the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Fig. 2f). Blebbistatin also suppressed the increase in cell height of RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that myosin-II activity and actin polymerization are required for apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Although most RasV12 cells were apically extruded when surrounded by normal cells, we also observed RasV12 cells that were not extruded.

We examined the fate of these non-extruded cells, and found that nonextruded RasV12 cells formed large protrusions that dynamically extended and retracted, often over distances of several cell diameters (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Information, Movie 4). Confocal microscopy analysis, showed that these protrusions extended beneath the neighbouring normal cells (Fig. 3b, lower panels). In contrast, MDCK cells expressing GFP did not produce large protrusions (Fig. 3b, upper panels). Apical extrusion and basal protrusion formation of RasV12 cells were observed in the same monolayer of normal cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4b). When expression of RasV12 was induced in a group of cells within a monolayer of normal cells, major protrusions (> 10 μm) were frequently formed at the interface between RasV12 and normal cells (Fig. 3c, white arrows, 3d), but were rarely observed between RasV12 cells (Fig. 3c, d). This indicates that protrusion formation also occurs in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Both F-actin and microtubules were found within the protrusions (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4c), suggesting a role for the cytoskeleton in the dynamic movement of protrusions. Although blebbistatin inhibited apical extrusion (Fig. 2f), it did not affect protrusion formation (Fig. 3e). In contrast, LY294002 inhibited protrusion formation (Fig. 3e), but not apical extrusion (Fig. 2f). Therefore, apical extrusion and basal protrusion formation are regulated, at least partially, by distinct molecular mechanisms. We also found that

adherens junctions are specifically disrupted at the interface between RasV12 and normal cells where protrusions are formed (Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Information, Fig. S5). RasV12 cells also formed major protrusions when cultured with normal cells on a collagen matrix (Fig. 3f, white arrows and arrowhead). Such protrusions extended beneath neighbouring normal cells and into the collagen. When cells were cultured for longer periods (120 h), non-extruded RasV12 cells invaded the collagen and proliferated underneath the normal cells (Fig. 3g). This occurred non-cell-autonomously, as in a monolayer of only RasV12 cells, RasV12 cells did not form major protrusions nor invade the collagen (0%, n = 25 independent experiments; Fig. 1c, lower right panels). Basal extrusion of RasV12 cells was also observed in vivo in the wing imaginal disc epithelium of Drosophila (40%, n = 85; Supplementary Information, Fig. S3c). The molecular mechanisms of apical extrusion and basal protrusion formation of RasV12 cells were further studied using transient expression systems. First, we confirmed that transient transfection of MDCK cells with GFP–RasV12 induced apical extrusion and basal protrusions comparable
464

to those observed in MDCK-pTR GFP–RasV12 cells (Fig. 4a). Expression of dominant-active Raf (RafCAAX) alone induced neither apical extrusion nor basal protrusions (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Information, Fig. S6a). Co-expression of dominant-negative Raf markedly suppressed RasV12induced MAPK activation and apical extrusion (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Information, Fig. S6a). These results suggest that the MAPK pathway is required, but not sufficient, to promote apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Expression of dominant-active PI(3)K (p110CAAX) alone promoted neither apical extrusion nor basal protrusion formation (Fig. 4a), whereas addition of LY294002 significantly suppressed basal protrusion formation (Fig. 3e), suggesting that the PI(3)K pathway is required, but not sufficient, to induce basal protrusions. These results suggest an involvement of other Ras targets in these processes10. ROCK induces phosphorylation of myosin light chain and activates myosin-II (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7a)11. Co-expression of dominant-negative ROCK (ROCKDN) significantly inhibited RasV12induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b, c). It also decreased apical extrusion while

RasV12-expressing cells are either (B) apically extruded from the monolayer or (C) form basal protrusions beneath the surrounding neighbours. After apical extrusion, RasV12 cells are viable and form multicellular aggregates above the monolayer of normal cells. RasV12 cells that form basal protrusions frequently invade collagen. The fate of RasV12 cells is influenced by the activity of Cdc42 and ROCK in RasV12 cells and by E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesions in the surrounding normal cells.

increasing basal protrusion formation (Fig. 4c), suggesting an important role of ROCK in these processes. We also examined whether Rho GTPases, crucial regulators for cytoskeletons and cell morphology 12,13, have a role in these processes. Co-expression of constitutively inactive Cdc42 (Cdc42N17) with RasV12 strongly suppressed apical extrusion and enhanced basal protrusion formation (Fig. 4c), whereas co-expression of constitutively inactive Rac had no effect on these processes (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7d), indicating that Cdc42 is another crucial regulator in these phenomena. Expression of Cdc42N17 or ROCKDN significantly suppressed the effect of RasV12 on cell height and intercellular F-actin accumulation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7e, f). However, the effect of ROCKDN on cell height was much weaker than that of Cdc42N17, and vice versa, on F-actin accumulation, suggesting that the effects of these two proteins are mediated, at least partially, by different downstream pathways. Using a recombinant protein for the Cdc42-binding domain (CRIB) of WASP (Supplementary Information, Fig. S6b), we found that the amount of GTP-bound active
nature cell biology volume 11 | number 4 | APrIl 2009

Cdc42 was substantially increased in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells (Fig. 4d and e). In contrast, it was significantly reduced in RasV12 cells surrounded by RasV12 cells (Fig. 4d, e)14. Taken together, these results indicate that Cdc42 is activated in a non-cell-autonomous manner in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells, which profoundly influences the fate of RasV12 cells. Finally, we induced expression of E‑cadherin shRNA in the surrounding normal cells, and examined the effect of knockdown of E-cadherin protein on the fate of RasV12 cells. When surrounded by E-cadherindeficient cells, RasV12 cells produced large basal protrusions more frequently (Fig. 5a, c) and were more often basally delaminated from the monolayer (Fig. 5b, c) than when surrounded by normal cells (Fig. 5c). In contrast, apical extrusion of RasV12 cells was greatly reduced when they were surrounded by E-cadherin-deficient cells (Fig. 5c). No significant basal delamination or protrusion formation was observed when normal cells were surrounded by E-cadherin-deficient cells (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that the fate of RasV12 cells can be influenced by

E-cadherin-based intercellular adhesions of surrounding normal cells. It is possible that basal invasion by Ras-transformed cells may be promoted under pathological conditions where E-cadherin-based cell–cell contacts are not properly formed in the surrounding epithelium, such as chronic inflammation or infection (see Supplementary Information Discussion on the molecular mechanisms of these processes and Fig. S8 for phenomena induced by other oncogenic stimuli). In Drosophila, it has been reported that the interaction between normal and transformed epithelial cells can cause several cellular processes, such as cell extrusion and apoptosis, that occur in a non-cell-autonomous fashion15–18. However, the molecular mechanism whereby normal and transformed cells recognize differences between each other is not clearly understood. Our data also suggest that RasV12 cells recognize that they are surrounded by normal cells. There are two possible molecular mechanisms of cell recognition: cells detect differences either in physical properties of other cells or in the composition of molecules (for example, lipids and proteins) in plasma membranes. We have found that RasV12 cells have higher membrane elasticity and cell viscosity than normal cells (Supplementary discussion and Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). It remains to be determined whether these physical properties are important in initial cell recognition machineries and/or whether there are unidentified molecules that are involved in cell-recognition between normal and transformed cells. In summary, when RasV12 is expressed in single cells in an epithelial monolayer, two independent phenomena can occur in a non-cellautonomous manner (Fig. 5d). RasV12-expressing cells are either apically extruded from the monolayer, or form basal protrusions leading to basal invasion into the matrix. The fate of RasV12 cells is influenced by the activity of Cdc42 and ROCK in RasV12 cells and by E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesions in the surrounding normal cells. Thus, RasV12 cells leave epithelial sheets either apically or basally in a cell-context-dependent manner. Our data and previous reports suggest that several cellular processes can occur at the interface between normal and transformed cells in Drosophila and vertebrates15–21. In future studies, it needs to be further clarified whether these processes indeed occur at the initial step of human carcinogenesis. These investigations may lead to a new preventive or therapeutic treatment for cancer. METHODS
Antibodies and materials. Rat anti-E-cadherin (ECCD2) and rabbit anti-ZO-1 antibodies were from Zymed. Mouse anti-β-catenin, mouse anti-E-cadherin and mouse anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Rat and mouse anti-E-cadherin antibodies were used for immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively. Rat anti-α-tubulin and mouse anti-GFP antibodies were from Abcam and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Rabbit anti-phosphomyosin light chain 2 (p-MLC; Thr 18/Ser 19) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, mouse anti-Pan-Ras antibody was from Calbiochem, Anti-GAPDH antibody was from Chemicon International and mouse anti-gp135 antibody was provided by G. K. Ojakian (SUNY Downstate Medical Center, NY) and used as an apical membrane marker. Mouse anti-β-galactosidase antibody was from Promega. Mouse anti-phospho-MAPK and rabbit anti-GST antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz, respectively. Alexa-568- and Alexa-647-conjugated anti-rat, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Invitrogen. All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 for immunofluorescence, except anti-p-MLC antibody, which was used at 1:25, and anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, which was used at 1:50. All secondary antibodies were used at 1:200. TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1.5 μg ml–1. Hoechst (Invitrogen) was used at 1:5,000. For western blotting, antibodies were used as follows: anti-Pan-Ras at 1:1,000, anti-GFP and anti-Ecadherin at 1:2,000 and anti-GAPDH at 1:5,000.

The following inhibitors were used: 4-AP (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), Ethidium homodimer-1 (Ethd-1, 1 μM, Invitrogen), (S)-(–)-blebbistatin (50 μM, Toronto Research Chemicals), U0126 (10 μM, Promega), LY294002 and Y27632 (10 μM, Calbiochem) and cytochalasin D (100 nM, Sigma-Aldrich). All inhibitors were added at the beginning of the experiments for 16–24 h incubation. DMSO (SigmaAldrich) was added at a dilution of 1:1,000 as a control. Time-lapse microscopy. MDCK cells stably expressing GFP–RasV12 or GFP– Rap1V12 were fluorescently labelled using CellTracker dye CMPTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Labelled cells were then trypsinized and combined with MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well in 35 mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation) for all experiments. Mixed cells were incubated for 8 h at 37 oC before being transferred to a tetracycline-containing medium. Where indicated, cells were analysed in the presence of 4-AP. To obtain time-lapse images, we used a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope with a Ludl Electronic Products Biopoint Controller and a Hamamatsu C4742-95 Orca camera (Hamamatsu). Images were captured and analysed using Openlab or Volocity software (Improvision). Collagen assays. Type-I collagen was obtained from R&D Systems (Cultrex Rat Collagen I) or Nitta Gelatin (Nitta Cellmatrix type 1-A), and was neutralized on ice to a final concentration of 2 mg ml–1 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Glass coverslips in 6-well culture dishes were coated with 1 ml of neutralized collagen and allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37 oC. For time-lapse experiments, 35 mm glass-bottom dishes were pre-coated with a thin layer (approximately 200 μl) of neutralized collagen. For each assay, between 5 x105 and 1 x106 cells were plated per well onto the collagen gel. RasV12 cells were combined with MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. After incubation for 8–16 h at 37 oC, tetracycline was added to induce RasV12 expression. A control (absence of tetracycline) was also included for each experiment. Cells were incubated for the indicated times, and tetracycline was replaced every 48 h. For immunostaining, cells on collagen were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/ PBS for 15 min at 37 oC, washed three times in PBS and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min. Cells were then washed once in PBS followed by three 10-min washes in glycine wash buffer (7 mM Na2HPO4, 3.5 mM NaH2PO4, 130 mM NaCl and 100 mM glycine). Cells were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (7 mM Na2HPO4, 3.5 mM NaH2PO4, 130 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20, 10% FCS, 0.02% BSA and 7.7 mM NaN3), and incubated with primary antibodies for 16 h at 4 oC. This was followed by three 10-min washes with gentle agitation in blocking buffer before incubation with Alexa-568- and Alexa-647-conjugated secondary antibodies and/or TRITC-phalloidin for 2–3 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in blocking buffer and were incubated with Hoechst/PBS for 2 min, followed by washing in PBS and mounting onto Mowiol on a glass slide. Cdc42 activation assay. The level of active GTP-bound Cdc42 in cells was determined using a GST fusion protein containing the Cdc42-interacting domain of WASP (WASP-CRIB)22. GST or GST–WASP-CRIB protein was produced as described previously 22,23. After fixation, permeabilization and blocking as described above, cells were incubated with 100 ng ml–1 of GST or GST–WASPCRIB protein in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min washes with gentle agitation in blocking buffer before incubation with anti-GST antibody for 16 h at 4 oC. After three 10-min washes with gentle agitation in blocking buffer, cells were incubated with Alexa-647-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in blocking buffer, incubated with Hoechst/PBS for 2 min and mounted onto Mowiol on a glass slide. Generation and analyses of Ras overexpressing clones in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Experimental genotypes were: RasV12: hs-FLP/+; tub>>Gal4 UAS–lacZ/UAS–rasV12..RasN17: hs-FLP/UAS–rasN17; tub>>Gal4 UAS–lacZ/+. Raswt: hs-FLP/+; tub>>Gal4 UAS–lacZ/UAS–raswt. Clones were induced by heatshocking larvae three days after egg laying (AEL) for 30 min at 37 °C. Larvae were dissected 68–72 h after clone induction and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Dissected hemilarvae were permeabilized in 0.05% TritonX-100/PBS (PBT) and incubated for 30 min in 4% FCS/PBT. Samples were incubated with a primary antibody (mouse anti β-galactosidase) for 16 h at 4 oC, and then with Alexa-488conjugated secondary antibody in 4% FCS/PBT for 2 h at room temperature. After

each incubation with an antibody, samples were extensively washed in PBT. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Imaging was performed on a confocal Leica SPE acquiring xz sections every 0.75–1.0 μmin. To induce the expression of RasV12 in the entire wing disc, we drove the expression of UAS–RasV12 under the control of nubbin–Gal4 at 25 oC. Data analyses. All statistical analyses were carried out using Student’s t tests. Detailed statistical analyses are described in Supplementary Information Methods.

Expression of v-Src was monitored by immunofluorescence using anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody. For each construct, more than 50 cells from 2-5 independent experiments were analysed. pmCherrry or pEGFP was cotransfected with pcDNA/TO/GFP-Myc or pSG-v-Src to analyse the formation of basal protrusions. It should be noted that basal protrusion formation was not substantially observed in MDCK cells expressing GFPMyc or v-Src under these experimental conditions (data not shown). We also found that MDCK cells transiently transfected with pRK5-myc RasV12 and pEGFP formed basal protrusions comparable to those observed in cells expressing GFP-RasV12 (data not shown).

Supplementary Movies

Movie S1 This movie shows the extrusion of GFP-RasV12 cells from a monolayer of normal MDCK cells, seeded on collagen gels. GFP-RasV12 cells were prestained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Once extruded, the RasV12 cells remain viable and proliferate to form a multi-cellular aggregate that loosely attaches to and moves above the normal MDCK monolayer. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 48 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 3 MB)

Movie S2 This movie shows that a GFP-Rap1V12-expressing MDCK cell is not extruded from a monolayer of normal MDCK cells on collagen gels. GFPRap1V12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-Rap1V12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 24 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 2.7 MB)

Movie S3 This movie shows that GFP-RasV12 MDCK cells are not extruded from a monolayer of GFP-RasV12 MDCK cells on collagen gels. GFP-RasV12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with non-stained GFP-RasV12 cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 24 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 1.2 MB)

Movie S4 This movie shows that a non-extruded GFP-RasV12 cell in a monolayer of normal MDCK cells forms dynamic basal protrusions. GFP-RasV12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 24 h, with fluorescent images captured every 50 min. (QuickTime; 136 KB)

Supplementary Discussion First, we would like to discuss the molecular mechanism of apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. We have not observed F-actin accumulation at the interface between normal and RasV12 cells (Fig. 2a and d), indicating that apical extrusion of RasV12 cells is not induced by “squeezing out” from the surrounding cells as observed in apical extrusion of apoptotic cells1. The PI3 kinase pathway is involved in lamellipodia formation and PI3K inhibitor does not affect apical extrusion (Fig. 2f), suggesting that apical extrusion is not due to increased migration of RasV12 cells. Then, how are RasV12 cells apically extruded when surrounded by normal cells? By analysing RasV12 cells that have not yet been extruded and have remained in the monolayer of normal cells, we have found that phosphorylation of myosin light chain is enhanced in RasV12 cells (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b and c) and that F-actin is accumulated at the intercellular junctions between RasV12 cells (Fig. 2a and d; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7f). Activation of myosin-II and intercellular F-actin accumulation would enhance surface tension and cell-cell adhesions of RasV12 cells, respectively2. Interestingly, these two parameters have been reported to be involved in cell sorting2-6; cells with higher surface tension and/or intercellular adhesions are thermodynamically encompassed by cells with lower tension and/or adhesions. Thus, the modulation of cytoskeleton that we have observed in RasV12 cells would promote RasV12 cells to selfaggregate in a monolayer of normal cells as a physically favoured process. We

have also observed that the height of RasV12 cells is enhanced when surrounded by normal cells (Fig. 2a and b), indicating that forces along the apico-basal axis are generated inside RasV12 cells. Since the presence of matrix on the basal side physically blocks basal movement of RasV12 cells, forces toward the apical direction will drive RasV12 cells to be apically extruded. We have further investigated the physical properties of normal and RasV12 cells by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)(Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). Utilising simultaneous AFM and fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9a), we have directly measured the apparent cell viscosity (µ) and the membrane elasticity (or Young’s Modulus)(E) of RasV12 and surrounding normal cells. We have found that RasV12 cells have significantly greater µ (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9b and c) and E values (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9d) than the surrounding normal cells do, indicating that RasV12 cells are stiffer and more viscous than normal cells. These parameters in RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells are not significantly different from those in RasV12 cells in a monolayer of RasV12 cells, suggesting that these physical properties are regulated in a cell-autonomous fashion. Notably, these mechanical parameters are significant in determining cell packing and geometry according to the recently proposed vertex model for cell organisation within an epithelial monolayer7. Based on this recent model, we suggest that energetic driving forces may play a vital role in the aggregation (and possibly extrusion) of RasV12 cells within the normal cell monolayer.

In Supplementary Information, Fig. S5, we present our analyses on cell-cell contacts at the interface between RasV12 and non-transformed cells. Components of adherens junctions, E-cadherin, β-catenin and p120-catenin, show incomplete or punctate immunostaining at cell-cell contacts where RasV12 cells extend a protrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a-c; data not shown for p120). Frequently, E-cadherin and β-catenin localise in vesicular puncta within the protrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5d; data not shown for β-catenin). Localisation of tight junction protein ZO-1 is not affected by protrusion formation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a and b, white arrowheads), indicating that Ecadherin-based cell-cell contacts are specifically disrupted. Both adherens junctions and tight junctions are maintained between RasV12 cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a and b, white arrows), suggesting that loss of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion specifically occurs at the interface between RasV12 and non-transformed cells. We therefore ask whether loss of E-cadherin is sufficient to induce protrusion formation by knocking down E-cadherin protein in MDCK cells using a tetracycline-inducible shRNA system (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5e). No protrusion formation is observed at the interface between normal and E-cadherin-deficient MDCK cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5f), indicating that loss of E-cadherin alone does not lead to protrusion formation but additional Ras-mediated signalling is required. We show in Fig. 4c that ROCK and Cdc42 are crucial in determining the fate of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells; either apically extruded, or

remaining in the monolayer and forming basal protrusions. Expression of dominant negative ROCK suppresses RasV12-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b and c), suggesting its role in activation of myosin-II. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other pathways may also be involved in the regulation of myosin-II. ROCK can be activated by active Rho8-10. Interestingly, expression of p50RhoGAP, an inactivator of Rho11, significantly enhances apical extrusion of RasV12 cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7d), suggesting that some Rho downstream targets play a negative role in this process. It is feasible that Rho activity may be regulated locally or temporally, which affects its multiple downstream targets and the fate of RasV12 cells. In future studies, it remains to be clarified how the activity of ROCK and Cdc42 is regulated in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells. E-cadherin knockdown in cells surrounding RasV12 cells reduces the frequency of apical extrusion, while promoting basal protrusion formation and invasion (Fig. 5a-c). In addition, other data suggest that signalling pathways of surrounding normal cells can affect the behaviour of RasV12 cells. Expression of dominant negative Raf has no effect on the frequency of basal protrusion formation of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells (Fig. 4b), whereas addition of MEK inhibitor suppresses it (Fig. 3e). Expression of dominant negative ROCK substantially promotes protrusion formation of RasV12 cells (Fig. 4c), whereas addition of blebbistatin does not affect it (Fig. 3e). These data

indicate the involvement of basal activity of MEK and myosin-II of surrounding normal cells in this process. Collectively, our results suggest that the fate of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells is determined by the total balance of multiple signalling pathways in both RasV12 cells and surrounding normal cells. It is highly plausible that apical extrusion would suppress tumour formation and that basal protrusion formation and basal delamination would promote it. We expect that novel therapeutic treatment for cancer may be discovered by further studying the molecular mechanisms of apical extrusion and basal protrusion formation of transformed cells. Finally, in MDCK cells, we have found that expression of v-Src highly promotes apical cell extrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8), but not basal protrusion formation (data not shown). Apical extrusion is observed in cells expressing either RasV12 or v-Src that stimulate distinct downstream targets. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate whether common signalling pathways are involved in these processes. Overexpression of Myc induces neither apical extrusion nor basal protrusion formation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8, and data not shown). These data suggest that different oncogenic stimuli induce different phenomena between normal and transformed cells, as previously shown in Drosophila melanogaster12, 13. In future studies, it should be examined whether deregulation of other oncoproteins or tumour suppressor proteins induces distinct phenomena at the interface with normal cells and how those phenomena are involved in the early stage of carcinogenesis in vertebrates.

Cell culture and RNA interference. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and ambient air supplemented with 5% CO2. To establish MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-RasV12 in an inducible manner, a Tet-ON system was used. Briefly, MDCK cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), followed by selection in medium containing 5 µg ml-1 of blasticidin (Invitrogen). pcDNA4/TO/GFPRasV12 was then used for the second transfection and the doubly transfected cells were selected in medium containing 10% FCS (tetracycline-free) (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), 5 µg ml-1 of blasticidin and 400 µg ml-1 of zeocin (Invitrogen). MDCK cells stably expressing GFP and GFP-Rap1V12 were produced under the same conditions. To induce GFP, GFP-RasV12 and GFPRap1V12 expression, 2 µg ml-1 tetracycline was added to culture medium. After the establishment of the RasV12 cell line, we confirmed that the expression level of GFP-RasV12 was uniform between cells as follows; we plated RasV12 cells sparsely and established more than 30 independent clones isolated from single cells. By comparing the expression of GFP-RasV12 between the clones by

Western blotting, we confirmed that GFP-RasV12 is indeed expressed at the same level in the RasV12 cell line we have used for the experiments. For transient expression experiments (Fig. 4a-c; Supplementary Information, Fig. S6-8), MDCK cells were first seeded on collagen-coated coverslips in 6-well culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 7 x 105 cells per well. On the following day, cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (2 µg per construct) using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were fixed and immunostained as described below. In Supplementary Information, Fig. S7a, following 4 hr of transfection, MDCK cells transiently transfected with constitutively active Rho (Myc-RhoV14) were further incubated with or without Y27632 for 18 h. MDCK cells stably expressing E-cadherin shRNA in a tetracycline-inducible manner were produced as follows; E-cadherin shRNA oligonucleotides (E-Cad shRNA-1; 5'GATCCCCGGACGTGGAAGATGTGAATTTCAAGAGAATTCACATCTTCC ACGTCCTTTTTGGAAA-3' and 5'AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGACGTGGAAGATGTGAATTCTCTTGAAATTCAC ATCTTCCACGTCCGGG-3', and E-Cad shRNA-2; 5’GATCCCCGTCTAACAGGGACAAAGAATTCAAAGAGATTCTTTGTCCC TGTTAGACTTTTTC-3’ and 5’-

of blasticidin and 800 µg ml-1 of G418 (Calbiochem). More than two stable clones were obtained for two independent shRNA oligonucleotides. Knockdown of Ecadherin was analysed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting following 96 h incubation with tetracycline (2 µg ml-1). It should be noted that comparable effect of E-cadherin knockdown on protrusion formation or apical extrusion was observed in cells expressing E-cadherin shRNA-1 or -2. Cells were plated as described below, except where indicated as low-density cells were plated at 1 x 105 cells in 6-well culture dishes.

Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence of cells cultured on serum-coated glass coverslips was performed as previously described17. Cells cultured on collagen gels were examined using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope and Leica Application Suite (LAS) software. Cells cultured on glass coverslips were examined using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP system mounted on a Nikon 800 microscope using Lasersharp software (Biorad). Images were analysed using ImageJ 1.36b (National Institute of Health) or Volocity software (Improvision).

Cell height (from apical to basal membranes) and F-actin accumulation at cell-cell contacts were both quantified using Metamorph 6.0 digital analysis software (Universal Imaging)(Fig. 2b and d; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7e and f). To determine the level of F-actin at cell-cell contacts, a defined region was created to encompass the area of a cell-cell contact in xz confocal sections. The total pixel intensity within this region (200 pixels) was determined. For quantification of apical extrusion of GFP-RasV12 cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors (Fig. 2f), GFP-RasV12 cells in groups > 3 cells were examined. Minor and major protrusions were counted as less or greater than 10 µm in length, respectively (Fig. 3d). To determine the amount of GST-WASP-CRIB (Fig. 4e) or p-MLC (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7c) in GFP- or GFP-RasV12-expressing cells, Metamorph 6.0 digital analysis software (Universal Imaging) was used. Briefly, a defined region was created in the cytoplasm of the indicated cells in xz confocal sections. For each cell, 5 (for GST-WASP-CRIB) or 8 (for p-MLC) regions were created. The total pixel intensity within each region (73 pixels) was determined and the mean pixel intensity was calculated for each cell. In Fig. 5c, GFP-RasV12 cells or normal MDCK cells that were apically extruded, basally delaminated or formed basal protrusions were counted and expressed as a ratio relative to total cells. Cells were counted following 24 h of tetracycline addition, however MDCKpTR E-cadherin shRNA cells were incubated with tetracycline for 72 h prior to mixing with other cells to induce sufficient knockdown of E-cadherin protein. In Supplementary Information, Fig. S5c, the correlation between protrusion

formation and E-cadherin or β-catenin mis-localisation was quantified as follows. Cell-cell contacts between RasV12 and normal MDCK cells were first identified using F-actin staining at the contact site. When 50% or less of the contact site was stained with E-cadherin or β-catenin, it was counted as broken or punctate. Conversely, cell-cell contacts with > 80% E-cadherin or β-catenin staining were counted as linear.

Atomic Force Microscopy. A JPK AFM (Nanowizard I) was used for all experiments with MSCT-AUHW cantilevers (14±1 pN/nm). The AFM was mounted on an inverted Olympus IX71 phase contrast and fluorescence microscope for simultaneous optical imaging and mechanical analyses. Force curves were measured at 1 Hz and analysed with the Hertz model to determine cortical elasticity for a 500-nm indentation18. Stress-relaxation experiments were performed in constant height mode and the vertical deflection sampled at 10 Hz. Data were fit with a stress-relaxation model (in the limit of a conical indenter) according to previous methodologies19, 20 to determine the apparent viscosity of the cell.

Statistical analyses. Student’s t tests were used to determine P value because this test requires variables with no fixed limits.
