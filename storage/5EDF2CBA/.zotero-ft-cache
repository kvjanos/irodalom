Highly Miniaturized HCA Assay for Neutrophil Chemotaxis in a Stable Gradient.
Chemotaxis, the movement of cells in the direction of a chemical gradient, is a fundamental process in inflammation. The iuvo Chemotaxis Assay Plate is a new approach for quantitative measurements of cell chemotaxis in a plate designed for use with automated liquid handling and HCA platforms. The plates are constructed in a single piece with no filters or membranes and are compliant with the SBS/ANSI standard for microplates. A chemical gradient is formed at one end of a microchannel and remains stable for several hours. Microscopic imaging of cell movement into the gradient region provides quantitative data on the number of cells migrating and distance traveled.

Fully Automated A ssay Method in a 96 Point Array
Fill device with 20 µL media through attractant addition port

Add 3 µL chemoattractant to attractant addition port. Gradient will stabilize in 30-90 minutes
Image based detection of cell number and distance traveled.
No Chemoattractant Chemoattractant only Chemoattractant plus Inhibitor

Add 3 µL (<10,000) cells to cell addition port

10x images of individual gradient microchannels. Gradient (low to high) is oriented right to left.

· Assay requires less than 12,000 cells per data point · Cells migrate in a stable gradient of chemoattractant · Addition only assay; no inserts or masks required · Fully compatible with lab automation workstations · Compound treatment of cells is performed in the assay plate.

Dose response inhibition of fMLP and IL-8 induced PMN chemotaxis. Approximately 12,000 cells per channel were pre-treated with the indicated amount of inhibitor in the plate for 30 min. After adding the indicated chemoattractant (200 nM fMLP or 62 nM IL-8), the plate was incubated for 2.5h. The graph shows the mean and standard deviation for replicates of 4.

Day-to - Day Reproducibilit y

IC50 values acquired from multiple dose response experiments. PMN chemotaxis dose response inhibition curves were obtained as described above. Shown are IC50 values obtained fromtwo separate experiments and the 95% confidence intervals as error bars.
