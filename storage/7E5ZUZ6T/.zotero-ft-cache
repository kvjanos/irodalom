Received 12th November 2009, Accepted 5th February 2010 First published as an Advance Article on the web 19th March 2010 DOI: 10.1039/b923699f An understanding of the mechanisms regulating cellular responses has recently been augmented by innovations enabling the observation of phenotypes at high spatio-temporal resolution. Technologies such as microﬂuidics have sought to expand the throughput of these methods, although assimilation with advanced imaging strategies has been limited. Here, we describe the pairing of high resolution time-lapse imaging with microﬂuidic multiplexing for the analysis of cellular dynamics, utilizing a design selected for facile fabrication and operation, and integration with microscopy instrumentation. This modular, medium-throughput platform enables the long-term imaging of living cells at high numerical aperture (via oil immersion) by using a conserved 96-well, B6 Â 5 mm2 imaging area with a variable input/output channel design chosen for the number of cell types and microenvironments under investigation. In the validation of this system, we examined fundamental features of cell cycle progression, including mitotic kinetics and spindle orientation dynamics, through the high-resolution parallel analysis of model cell lines subjected to anti-mitotic agents. We additionally explored the self-renewal kinetics of mouse embryonic stem cells, and demonstrate the ability to dynamically assess and manipulate stem cell proliferation, detect rare cell events, and measure extended time-scale correlations. We achieved an experimental throughput of >900 cells/experiment, each observed at >40Â magniﬁcation for up to 120 h. Overall, these studies illustrate the capacity to probe cellular functions and yield dynamic information in time and space through the integration of a simple, modular, microﬂuidics-based imaging platform.

Introduction
Cell signaling pathways provide the central circuitry to respond to environmental changes, inﬂuence internal programs for growth and diﬀerentiation, and cooperatively integrate various inputs for cellular homeostasis. Increasingly, the kinetics of these signaling processes are being interrogated by microscopic tracking of ﬂuorescently-tagged molecules in living cells.1,2 High-resolution spatial observations have demonstrated the role of molecular, organelle, and cytoskeletal compartmentalization in directing cellular responses,3 whereas coupled high-ﬁdelity temporal measurements provide the ordering of these signaling events. For example, these techniques have revealed internal cellular dynamics (such as membrane receptor and signaling molecule turnover4) that aﬀect cell fate decisions (e.g., migration and cell division5,6) and multi-cellular tissue interactions (e.g., during embryonic development and disease7,8). However, in these examples, the

Insight, innovation, integration
The dynamics of regulatory networks that underlie cellular functions are increasingly studied by live cell microscopy. However, current lab-scale approaches to capture cellular kinetics are often optimized either for high spatial resolution, high temporal resolution, or high experimental throughput. Here, we developed a microﬂuidic imaging platform that balances spatio-temporal resolution, experimental throughput, and ease of operation and construction. We explored cell cycle and proliferation kinetics for model cell lines and embryonic stem cells, simultaneously analyzing >900 cells, under multiple perturbations, per 5 day experiment. We identiﬁed rare and prolonged mitotic events, including slippage under mitotic arrest and long-term synchronous division timing, highlighting the potential of this technology to measure extended time-scale correlations in the investigation of cellular dynamics.

detailed understanding of cellular kinetics has been slowed, on the one hand, by the inadequate throughput of high-resolution microscopy and, on the other, by the limited range of cellular measurements which can be obtained in current high-throughput (but low spatio-temporal resolution) screening systems. Accelerating the throughput of these experiments would not only reveal the comprehensive capabilities of regulatory networks,9 but also enhance applications such as drug screening by elucidating new compound actions.10 Progress in cellular dynamics has mirrored improvements in microscopic imaging systems, including environmental controls to permit cell growth during extended time-lapse recording and autofocus systems for image stability. Currently, microscopic observations at high resolution require dedicated imaging instrumentation and are primarily restricted to serial analysis. Miniaturized platforms, including multiwell conﬁgurations and microfabrication technologies, have facilitated the assessment of cellular responses to many stimuli in parallel. Microﬂuidics-based approaches, in particular, provide substantial spatial and temporal control over soluble environments, and have been developed for the culture of a wide range of cell types.11–19 However, widespread utilization of these platforms has been limited, either due to the complex fabrication and operation of multi-layer valved devices, or to the cost of automated commercial systems. As such, the potential beneﬁts of integrating microﬂuidic technologies with high spatio-temporal resolution microscopy have yet to be fully realized.9 Here, we present a microﬂuidic platform for live cell imaging in multiple isolated microenvironments longitudinally in time. The design of this platform incorporates a balance between imaging resolution, experimental throughput, and simplicity for ease of construction and implementation. The platform is compatible with high numerical aperture oil-immersion objectives for high-resolution subcellular imaging. Its modular, multiplexed design permits the simultaneous time-lapse microscopy of many cell types, harboring various biomolecular reporters, under numerous perturbations, and within the same device over many days, thereby increasing the throughput available on a single imaging workstation. We obtained a number of key measurements such as mitotic timing and spindle orientation for immortalized cell lines as well as temporal proﬁling of cell proliferation and lineage analysis for mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. These data, consistent with standard tissue culture and further enabling the novel detection of rare and long-duration cellular events, demonstrate the beneﬁt of a simple microﬂuidic platform in which high-resolution time-lapse microscopy can be carried out for many cell types, under an array of experimental conditions, and over long time courses.

For high-resolution microscopy using high numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objectives, we designed a 96-microwell array (8 rows Â 12 columns) within a scanning region of B5 Â 6 mm (Fig. 1A and B), smaller than the typical lens excursion limit (B10 mm) before oil reapplication is required. This miniaturized array footprint also reduced stage translation distances, speeding multi-position image capture and increasing temporal resolution. The microwell array comprised a single-layer microﬂuidic network cast in elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and bonded to a 35 Â 50 mm glass coverslip (Fig. 1A). Each microwell (250 Â 350 mm; 50 or 100 mm deep) provided a cell-adhesive surface area of 0.074 mm2 and a volume of 3.7 or 7.4 nL (Fig. 1C), for B400Â lower surface area and >10 000Â lower volume compared to a standard 96-well microtiter plate. Cells preferentially attached in the microwell center, where ﬂuid velocity is decreased relative to the 50 mm wide connecting channels (Fig. 1C and D). The microwell conﬁguration also promoted imaging over multiple days, as the cells (typically 10–30 per well) were less likely to traverse from one microwell to another (ESIz Movie 1). Initial designs included catching pillars17 to increase cell seeding eﬃciency (ESIz Fig. 2), but these were removed in the ﬁnal design as cells crawled up the pillars and out of the microscope focal plane after B1 day. Considerable versatility in dividing the 96 wells across multiple independent cell/ environment combinations is aﬀorded by connecting inlet and outlet channels to one or more reservoirs each (ESIz Fig. 1). 96 wells were chosen for the design as it provided ﬂexibility for subdividing the microenvironments, although this number could be expanded based on device requirements. For these studies, we commonly used a device with four independent ﬂuidic networks (I–IV), each separated by at least 500 mm to prevent cross-contamination of hydrophobic molecules which can penetrate B300 mm PDMS over several days (ESIz Fig. 3). The ﬂuidic circuit design enables gentle cell seeding into the microdevice by gravity-driven ﬂow (Fig. 1E). Adding 5 mL cell suspension to the inlet reservoir raised the ﬂuid height by B1 mm and induced cells to ﬂow through the device in o1 min. Equalizing inlet and outlet volumes then halted ﬂuid ﬂow, allowing cells to settle and attach to the glass substrate. Fresh media were added by micropipette or, for remote feeding during long-term experiments, by perfusion through sterile tubing added to the reservoirs. Cell culture within microﬂuidic channels also requires the balanced optimization of nutrient transport and protection from shear forces. The modular design of this platform enabled speciﬁc tailoring of these parameters to sensitive cell types such as ES cells, without changing the microchannel pattern. These modiﬁcations are addressed in greater detail in the ESIz Methods. Overall, this platform enables the rapid and facile loading of many diﬀerent cell types, without multilayer interconnects that exist in more complex devices, and the establishment of many isolated soluble microenvironments for imaging at high numerical apertures. Further, the devices are reconﬁgurable both to the physical and nutritive requirements of the cell types under investigation, and to the multiplexing needs of the researcher.

Near-simultaneous microscopy of cell cycle perturbation by anti-mitotic drugs As a case study, we ﬁrst used the microﬂuidic imaging platform to quantify the eﬀects of several anti-mitotic drugs on cell cycle kinetics in two mammalian cell lines, a Potorous tridactylus (rat kangaroo) kidney cell line (PtK2) and a human cervical carcinoma (HeLa). PtK2 cells, which remain ﬂattened during mitosis and contain only a few large chromosomes, are ideal for mitotic imaging studies.20 HeLa cells represent model human cancerous targets of anti-mitotic agents. Both cell types harbored ﬂuorescent protein fusions to monitor chromosome dynamics (histone H2B-EYFP, enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent protein) or mitotic spindle dynamics (EYFP-tubulin).21 We monitored cell division in an array of cell types, subcellular EYFP markers, and antimitotic agents at high resolution using a 40Â (1.3 NA) oil-immersion objective. It is important to note that these anti-mitotic drugs, which are hydrophobic small molecules, were used at concentrations well above their EC50s,22 in part due to the potential for loss into the PDMS device walls (see ESIz Fig. 3). The eﬀectiveness of the drug treatments were veriﬁed by monitoring microtubule morphology. Near simultaneous observation of these distinct experimental conditions taken

at ﬁve minute intervals over ﬁve days demonstrates the increased throughput of the platform (Fig. 2, ESIz Movie 1). Cells survived, divided, and responded to exogenous agents within the device in a manner similar to that of bulk tissue culture. Successful cell division in the microﬂuidic device was observed in nearly all PtK2 cells (99%, n = 139) and most HeLa cells (82%, n = 112) exposed to vehicle control conditions. Nocodazole (NZ) destabilizes microtubules, disrupting spindle attachment to kinetochores,23 and causing prometaphase arrest and, in many cell types, subsequent cell death.24 In the microﬂuidic device, treatment with 300 nM NZ prevented the alignment and segregation of condensed chromosomes. Whereas NZ-exposed HeLa cells exhibited hypercondensed chromosomes and blebbing (Fig. 2F and L) characteristic of apoptotic death, all PtK2 cells survived and decondensed their chromosomes again after mitotic slippage (Fig. 2B).25 Taxol (TX) stabilizes microtubules and interferes with their normal breakdown during cell division.26 Treatment of cells with 10 mM TX induced ectopic microtubule foci (Fig. 2I) and prevented chromosomal alignment and separation. All TX-treated PtK2 cells exited mitosis without cell division and decondensed chromosomes into micronuclei (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, PtK2 cells with fragmented nuclei were still able to enter mitosis a second time (ESIz Fig. 4B), although this event was observed

Fig. 2 Time-lapse montage of cells subjected to drugs altering microtubule stability or Eg5 activity in the microﬂuidic device. Individual PtK2 and HeLa cells are shown before (G2), during (M) and after (G1) mitosis at the indicated elapsed times (h:min). The frequency of cell fates after mitotic entry (division, slippage, or apoptosis) is shown for each condition. Histone H2B-EYFP labels chromosomal DNA (A–F), and EYFP-tubulin labels microtubules (G–L). Cells subject to vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) mostly divided successfully (A,E,G,K). Nocodazole (NZ; 300 nM) destabilized microtubules (H,L) preventing chromosomal separation, after which PtK2 cells exit mitosis and survive (B) but HeLa cells die (F). Taxol (TX; 10 mM) induced ectopic microtubule foci (I) preventing chromosomal alignment; PtK2 chromosomes decondensed into micronuclei after mitotic slippage (C). Treatment with Eg5 inhibitor STLC (10 mM) caused monopolar mitotic spindles (J) and a characteristic rosette conﬁguration of misaligned chromosomes (D); PtK2 cells survived following mitotic exit.

infrequently. The mitotic inhibitor S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) targets mitotic kinesin Eg5, thereby preventing the formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle.27 Treatment of cells with 10 mM STLC resulted in monopolar mitotic spindles (Fig. 2J) and a characteristic rosette conﬁguration of misaligned chomosomes (Fig. 2D). All STLC-treated PtK2 cells were able to decondense their chromosomes and exit mitosis, similar to cells with NZ- and TX-induced microtubule perturbations. Overall, mitosis in the microﬂuidic platform closely matched behaviors in bulk tissue culture.25,28,29 Moreover, the ability to query multiple cell types with diﬀerent ﬂuorescently-tagged proteins under the perturbation of many drugs, all in a single device, increased experimental throughput and permitted the observation of population variations and rare events (e.g. multiple divisions under taxol arrest). Simultaneous measurements during multiplexed experiments also eliminated the conventional daily variations that can increase intrinsic biological variability in serially-performed experiments.

HeLa cells. We identiﬁed the initiation time and duration of each mitotic phase in H2B-EYFP-labeled cells exposed to multiple drug treatments (Fig. 3A and B, ESIz Fig. 4A). Chromosome condensation timing (prophase length) was unaﬀected in NZ-treated PtK2 cells, suggesting that microtubule polymerization plays no role in condensation or early mitotic entry. We measured drug-induced mitotic delays from prometaphase to mitotic exit, since prometaphase initiation was more reliably identiﬁed by morphological cues. Cells treated with TX exited mitosis most quickly (4.1 Æ 1.5 h, mean Æ S.D.), followed by STLC (6.6 Æ 2.5 h), and NZ-treated cells (9.0 Æ 2.9 h); DMSO-treated control PtK2 cells completed cell division in 1.41 Æ 0.33 h. The mitotic slippage time appeared inversely correlated with the number of attached kinetochores: TX (1-2 attached) B STLC (B1 attached) o NZ (none attached), consistent with a role for the spindle assembly checkpoint in mitotic slippage time, in addition to its role in delaying anaphase onset.28,29 HeLa cells progressed through mitosis more slowly than PtK2 cells. In vehicle controls, HeLa chromosome alignment and separation (prometaphase to anaphase) was 37% (10%–58% interquartile range) slower than PtK2 cells; HeLa

cells also showed more variability in this period (ESIz Fig. 5B). Unlike PtK2 cells, NZ-treated HeLa cells all underwent cell death following failed mitoses after B18 h (mean), consistent with previous measurements in standard bulk cell culture.22,25,30,31 A small fraction (11%, n = 54) of NZ-treated HeLa cells recovered brieﬂy with decondensed chromosomes, attempted mitosis again, but did not survive thereafter (ESIz Fig. 5D). The observation of rare and prolonged events in these devices (here, 20 to 35 h elapsed between the ﬁrst mitotic initiation and eventual apoptosis) underscore a key beneﬁt of long-term multiplexed imaging experiments. Furthermore, the large data set generated for this analysis (two cell lines, two ﬂuorescent markers, and four microenvironmental conditions) was

carried out in three 3–5 day time-lapse experiments imaging 504 mitotic events among B1200 cells in 48 microwells. A serial approach, by contrast, would have required months to acquire the same sample size. Spatial dynamics of subcellular components during mitosis As an example of spatial quantiﬁcation in the microdevice, we compared spindle pole separation and rotation during mitosis in EYFP-tubulin-expressing PtK2 versus HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). PtK2 centrosomes reached their metaphase separation distance (14.1 Æ 1.7 mm) asymptotically in B30 min; HeLa centrosomes reached their 11.2 Æ 0.6 mm metaphase distance twice as quickly despite similar maximum velocities (0.83 Æ 0.09 vs. 0.82 Æ 0.27 mm minÀ1). Initial centrosome separation often did not coordinate with the eventual cytokinesis axis, especially in PtK2 cells (Fig. 3D). The centrosome pair smoothly rotated to the cytokinesis axis just before chromosome separation in PtK2 cells or B45 min prior in HeLa cells. We measured centrosome separation velocity during anaphase B/telophase in PtK2 cells (0.89 Æ 0.23 mm minÀ1) to be nearly twice that of HeLa cells (0.46 Æ 0.09 mm minÀ1). Similar spatio-temporal measurements, such as nuclear translocation of proteins or cytoskeletal movements, represent additional phenotypic dimensions quantiﬁable with highresolution microscopy and useful for elucidating compound targets in secondary drug screens.32,33 Time-lapse analysis of embryonic stem cell proliferation kinetics ES cells, both mouse and human, exhibit distinctive cell cycle features that have been linked with self-renewal and the maintenance of pluripotency.34 We explored the utility of the microﬂuidic imaging platform for investigating stem cell proliferation kinetics with improved temporal ﬁdelity. Initial experiments utilizing the devices conﬁgured for cell line studies demonstrated a decline in ES cell survival and proliferation over time. Consequently, we further optimized the

NZ aﬀected chromosome separation but not condensation (P–PM). Mitotic delay (PM-I/Ap) correlated with the number of unattached chromosomes (NZ > STLC B TX > DMSO).

microﬂuidic device for mouse ES cell culture through a series of straightforward modiﬁcations outlined in ESIz Methods and ESIz Fig. 6. ESIz Table 1 and 2 speciﬁcally illustrate the perfusion parameters explored. To promote adequate nutrient delivery to ES cells, the height of the channels was doubled, continuous low-shear ﬂow conditions were instituted, and the material thickness of the PDMS above the internal imaging areas was minimized to promote gas exchange. Through incorporation of these parameters we accomplished eﬃcient loading, attachment, and survival of mouse ES cells in the microﬂuidic channels, and observed ES cell proliferation with concurrent maintenance of the pluripotency marker, Oct4, over 4 days of analysis (ESIz Fig. 7). Analogous to the cell line studies, we used mouse ES cells expressing an H2B-EGFP fusion protein to facilitate examination of ES cell proliferation dynamics (Fig. 4). In these studies, mouse ES cells were cultured within the microﬂuidic device on previously incorporated mouse

embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF) feeder layers with perfusion of ES cell growth medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The time-lapse imaging interval was set to every 3 min to obtain suﬃcient temporal resolution of ES cell kinetics, and 24–32 independent positions were interrogated per experiment. Representative images sampled at 8 h intervals from the time-lapse acquisition of a single position demonstrate the proliferation of the ES cells under these conditions (Fig. 4A). A complete time-lapse sequence for 24 positions acquired in parallel over the course of a 60 h experiment is shown in ESIz Movie 2. An overlaid ﬂuorescence/phase contrast sequence for one position highlights the highly dynamic movement of the ES cells and the MEF feeder layer concomitant with the extensive ES cell proliferation (ESIz Movie 3). The compatibility of this platform with both feeder independent mouse ES cell lines and co-cultures of mouse ES cells with supportive feeder layers eﬀectively expands the scope of stem cell lines and culture conditions that can be examined in the device. Taken together, these results suggest that the device parameters employed provided suﬃcient nutrients, balanced with local or upstream cell-derived factors for ES cell survival and proliferation. Future experiments could continue to explore these mechanisms by manipulating ﬂow rates, examining co-culture systems, and adjusting device conﬁgurations for analyzing microwells that are connected in series. Previous reports have indicated that a number of parameters (e.g. delivery of nutrients and paracrine signaling) can be precisely varied utilizing microﬂuidic control. For example, features inherent to microﬂuidic stem cell culture platforms, such as device conﬁgurations and perfusion conditions, dictate delivery of nutrients and paracrine stimuli and have been shown to inﬂuence cell functions.16,35,36 Tracking chromosomal movements not only provides information about the cell cycle kinetics of individual cells, but it can also be used to elucidate overall trends within a population. For example, the recognition of typical nuclear/ chromosome morphologies indicative of cell proliferation or other cell fates have been routinely used in high-throughput screens that employ imaging readouts.37–39 Here, we took advantage of the time-lapse acquisition of multiple positions in parallel to obtain a collective measurement of ES cell proliferation within the context of the microﬂuidics platform. For this analysis, the identiﬁcation of cell divisions, or ‘mitotic events’, was principally based on the characteristic morphology of H2B-EGFP during metaphase (Fig. 4B). The mitotic events were identiﬁed either through manual inspection or automated image analysis (Fig. 4B), and together with automated measurements of total nuclei area to normalize cell numbers, the number of mitotic events within 2 h time blocks was calculated (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, an apparent synchronization in division frequency was observed, even when assessed as a collective average of numerous positions from separate quadrants in the device. The periods between the peaks in division frequency suggest an average cell cycle time of 10–12 h, an estimation that is within the reported range for mouse ES cells.40,41 The presence of this trend derived from the collective proliferation dynamics is indicative of the tightly regulated cell cycle time for mouse ES cells, with the substantially reduced G1 phase recognized for ES cells

(A) The cell division time points for identiﬁable stages of 20 distinct H2B-EGFP ES cell lineage hierarchies, some through 4 generations, were compiled from the analysis of 7 separate microwells from a single representative experiment under self-renewing conditions (+LIF, MEF feeder layer).

likely contributing to this process.42–45 Future experiments could exploit features of the microﬂuidics system to study mechanisms that contribute to this synchronization eﬀect. These include the capacity to manipulate soluble environments during time-lapse observation. For example, as a demonstration of dynamic perturbation in the context of cell cycle analysis, we explored the manipulation of mouse ES cell cycle progression, through the introduction of the mitotic inhibitor STLC during the course of microﬂuidic cell culture with continuous image acquisition (ESIz Fig. 8). Overall, the means to acquire temporal measurements suitable for the dual assessment of stem cell kinetics at the single cell as well as a population level is a key feature of this type of platform. Lineage tracking and assessment of cell cycle kinetics for embryonic stem cells The ability to track cell divisions and chromosomal dynamics for the statistically rigorous examination of cell cycle kinetics can be augmented by the assimilation of lineage relationships, which can provide additional insights regarding regulatory mechanisms. Displayed in Fig. 5A are segments of 20 lineage relationships and their division timings, some through 4 generations, identiﬁed from the analysis of 7 diﬀerent positions from a single experiment. Select images from one of these lineage hierarchies are highlighted in Fig. 5B, showing the progression of a single ES cell to 8 cells under self-renewing conditions on a MEF feeder layer over approximately 25 h, with the associated divisions demarcated. Within this sampling of lineage relationships, the direct quantiﬁcation of the complete cell cycle times (metaphase-to-metaphase) for the ﬁrst division generation demonstrates an average cycle timing of 11.53 h Æ 2.70 h, n = 40 (Fig. 5C). This duration

corresponds closely with the measurements based on the collective proliferation dynamics (Fig. 4C). The direct quantiﬁcation analysis additionally illustrated the presence of select cell divisions that exhibited more substantial deviations from this average, which were more prevalent among second and third generation divisions (Fig. 5A and C). Furthermore, in order to speciﬁcally assess diﬀerences between the division timings of sister-related cells, metaphase-to-metaphase times for sister pairings, from ﬁrst through third generation divisions, were plotted against each other (Fig. 5D). A tight correlation was observed, demonstrated by the slope of the best-ﬁt linear regression that approached 1.00 (0.96, R2 = 0.94), and the average diﬀerence in sister division times which was 0.80 h Æ 0.80 h, n = 40. Interestingly, the subset of cells which demonstrated the extended mitotic timings similarly exhibited a strong correlation between sister pairings (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the factors responsible for the division synchronicity of sister-related cells operate independent of the cell cycle duration. Currently, the mechanisms that inﬂuence deviations from the average timing in this culture context remain unidentiﬁed. However, further studies utilizing the microﬂuidics platform could facilitate the examination of promising regulatory mechanisms, including any potential role of localized soluble factors, early stages of diﬀerentiation induction, or stochastic variation in ES cell proliferation kinetics.46–48 Microﬂuidics-integrated imaging platform: summary of enabling features In these studies, we describe a device platform that permits high numerical aperture imaging of numerous isolated environments with high temporal resolution.

the multiplexing capacity of this platform, the cell line studies quantifying mitotic kinetics utilized three microﬂuidic devices and monitored 48 microwells in total for up to 120 h in B2 weeks of recording. With additional seeding inlets to load more cell types per device (ESIz Fig. 1), and making use of all 96 microwells in the current device conﬁguration (experiments shown here used less than 40% of the total device capacity), these studies could potentially be performed in a single 5 day experiment. In contrast, serial time-lapses of this length with conventional, single well microscopy would require months and introduce signiﬁcant day-to-day variability. Modern high throughput systems (HTS) for imaging (e.g. Perkin-Elmer Opera, GE InCell, Cellomics KineticScan, BD Pathway, etc.) provide some of the functionality that we have developed in our platform, but often cannot be modiﬁed easily for other imaging modalities.9 In the development of this system, we aimed to achieve such advantageous multiplexing properties in conjunction with several additional features: a miniaturized device footprint, which enables the eﬀective utilization of rapid imaging protocols with high numerical aperture objectives, and a simple and modular design for promoting broad applicability for biological experimentation. Towards wider dissemination of simple microﬂuidics platforms in biology, this platform is amenable to methods of construction and operation within the context of limited microfabrication and automation resources, such as the casting of devices from inexpensive plastic mold masters49 and the compatibility with micropipette ﬂuid handling. By increasing experimental throughput and spatio-temporal imaging resolution, this platform aids higher-content quantiﬁcation of cellular dynamics. Analysis of dividing mammalian cells revealed the timing of cell fate choices and subcellular movements, and enabled the identiﬁcation of rare and prolonged events in the mitotic process. Whereas some of these analyses used manual tracking of video frames, the stem cell experiments employed automated identiﬁcation of metaphase nuclei to quantify self-renewal kinetics within the microﬂuidics context. Eﬀective data analysis approaches are critical towards further expansions in throughput. Such automation speeds image analysis but also increases data content.50 For example, the spatial registration of cellular events enables correlation with local microenvironment features such as cell–cell interactions at the center or periphery of multicellular bodies (ESIz Fig. 9). Overall, this approach could facilitate studies examining the eﬀects of microenvironmental factors, including physical cues, such as extracellular matrix, and a range of autocrine and paracrine signals. The rapid accumulation of large-scale chemical and genome-wide RNA interference-based cellular assays based on end-point analysis (so-called high content analyses)51–53 has provided large numbers of ‘‘hits’’ indicating some biological inﬂuence of compounds and genes. The coupled microﬂuidics and imaging method described here, together with automated analysis software, can serve as a key tool in measuring quantitative spatial and temporal responses that probe the results of these screening experiments more deeply toward understanding their biological targets. In addition, a wide range of traditionally lower-throughput biological assays may beneﬁt from features of this integrated approach,

particularly the capacity to speed data acquisition, control environmental variability, and interrogate signaling pathway components simultaneously through parallel analysis.

Materials and methods
Fabrication and loading of cellular imaging devices The microwell array was fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using soft lithography techniques54 and outlined in detail in the ESIz Methods. Brieﬂy, SU8-50 photoresist (Microchem) was spin-coated on silicon wafers to a thickness of 50 mm, crosslinked by UV exposure through a highresolution photomask, and developed. PDMS prepolymer and curing agent were mixed in a 10 : 1 ratio and poured onto the silicon/SU8 mold masters to a depth of 5 mm and cured. Following coring of the inlet and outlet reservoirs, PDMS devices were bonded to 35 Â 50 mm glass coverslips using oxygen plasma activation. For ES cell studies, photoresist thickness was increased to 100 mm and PDMS casting depth was reduced to 1 mm, and an unpatterned PDMS layer, covering the inlets and outlets only, was bonded on top of the device layer for structural support. Devices were sterilized and channels treated with serum containing medium (PtK2 or HeLa cells) or 0.1% gelatin solution (ES cells) to provide a cell-adhesive surface. 5 mL PtK2 or HeLa cells were loaded at a concentration of 15 Â 106 mLÀ1 (75 000 total), and allowed to adhere for >8 h prior to time-lapse analysis. Culture medium within the device was refreshed with periodic perfusion. For MEF-ES co-cultures, MEF cells were loaded into 0.1% gelatin treated devices at 2 Â 106/mL. After overnight incubation, mouse ES cells were loaded at 2 Â 106 mLÀ1. For feeder-free ES cell experiments, ES cells were loaded at 5 Â 106 mLÀ1 into 0.1% gelatin coated devices. ES media was refreshed by continuous perfusion (1 ml hÀ1) during time-lapse imaging. Additional details regarding cell culture, device seeding, and medium changes are described in the ESIz Methods. Time-lapse imaging Time-lapse imaging was carried out on a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope conﬁgured with the Perfect Focus drift compensation systems and a high-precision XY stage (Ludl model 96S108-LE; 0.25 mm repeatability). Environmental conditions were controlled by a whole-microscope enclosure (In vivo Scientiﬁcs, St. Louis, MO) that permitted regulation of temperature, humidity and CO2 gas perfusion. Image acquisition and position control was carried out by Nikon Elements software. Experiments typically observed 24–36 microwell positions, selected from multiple quadrants at regular intervals representing a range of sections in the device, and with an imaging interval of 5 min (PtK2 and HeLa cells) or 3 min (mouse ES cells). Acquisition time per well averaged 3–4 s, including XY stage translation, Z focus, and r500 ms exposure for each ﬂuorescent color and brightﬁeld image; each ‘‘round-trip’’ required B2 min. Temporal and spatial measurements For the analysis of PtK2 and HeLa cell cycle kinetics, image sequences were assessed by manually identifying the initiation

of mitotic stages for each cell and well, as deﬁned in ESIz Fig. 4. To quantify spindle dynamics, image sequences were loaded in ImageJ software and centrosome positions were selected as the brightest pixel in the vicinity of centrosomes in tubulin-EYFP-labeled cells. Centrosome separation distance and angle were then calculated from calibrated XY position data with a spatial resolution of 1 pixel (0.33 mm). For ES cell proliferation experiments, cellular divisions were quantiﬁed based on chromosome morphologies indicated by H2B-EGFP ﬂuorescence. Metaphase nuclei and total nuclei area were quantiﬁed utilizing an image analysis pipeline developed with CellProﬁlert analysis software,55 and conﬁrmed by manual inspection and enumeration performed in parallel. Details regarding automated analysis are included in ESIz Methods. Mitotic kinetics within ES cell lineage hierarchies were evaluated by manual tracking of cell divisions and progeny through sequential time-lapse frames.
