Single-cell quantiﬁcation of molecules and rates using open-source microscope-based cytometry
Andrew Gordon1,2, Alejandro Colman-Lerner1,2, Tina E Chin1, Kirsten R Benjamin1, Richard C Yu1 & Roger Brent1
Microscope-based cytometry provides a powerful means to study cells in high throughput. Here we present a set of reﬁned methods for making sensitive measurements of large numbers of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells over time. The set consists of relatively simple ‘wet’ methods, microscope procedures, open-source software tools and statistical routines. This combination is very sensitive, allowing detection and measurement of fewer than 350 ﬂuorescent protein molecules per living yeast cell. These methods enabled new protocols, including ‘snapshot’ protocols to calculate rates of maturation and degradation of molecular species, including a GFP derivative and a native mRNA, in unperturbed, exponentially growing yeast cells. Owing to their sensitivity, accuracy and ability to track changes in individual cells over time, these microscope methods may complement ﬂow-cytometric measurements for studies of the quantitative physiology of cellular systems.

Single-cell measurements can reveal information obscured in population averages. For example, studies of variation in gene expression in individual Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae1,2 cells have shown that only a fraction of cell-to-cell variation in the expression of reporter genes results from stochastic ﬂuctuations in the workings of the gene expression machinery3–5, and have identiﬁed other processes and genes that account for and control the bulk of the variation3. One means to collect single-cell data is ﬂow cytometry, whose development began in the 1930s (ref. 6). Modern instruments are powerful6 but (i) cannot interrogate individual cells repeatedly to produce time series for each cell, (ii) cannot collect a great deal of light, owing to both the short time (typically microseconds) that the cell passes the detector, and to the numerical aperture of the objective, which often collects less than 10% of the emitted light, and (iii) typically do not capture images of the cells, making it difﬁcult to analyze cell shape, size and intracellular localization of ﬂuorescence. Some recent work has attempted to address the last two limitations by integrating the ﬂuorescence signal over longer times and capturing cell images with custom-built charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors7.

Optical microscopy can compensate for some limitations of ﬂow cytometry by providing abilities to revisit individual cells over time, collect emitted light for long times and capture cell images with high resolution. Automation by computer-aided cell tracking and image analysis, as begun in the 1960s, permits generation of such data with high throughput8–13. During the past 20 years, a good deal of research-directed automated microscope-based cytometry outside of clinical and pharmaceutical applications has relied on two commercial software packages, Metamorph (Molecular Devices Corporation) and ImagePro (Media Cybernetics, Inc.), to operate the microscopes, collect the data and analyze them. These packages, often used together with more general purpose analysis programs, such as Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) and Labview (National Instruments Corporation), probably constitute the state of the art in commercial software used for these purposes. Likewise, open-source projects can provide valuable tools for image analysis. Examples include the Open Microscopy Environment (OME), which provides ﬁle formats and metadata standards for microscope images14, Image J, a Java-based package of microscope image analysis tools15, and CellProﬁler16. Here we describe a suite of user-modiﬁable, technical and analytical methods to facilitate accurate, high-throughput measurements from single cells over time. The methods each derive from relatively well-known techniques but combine to produce a powerful, open-source microscope-based cytometry. The methods work with single yeast cells and mammalian lymphocytes, and can be altered for other cell types. When used with inexpensive optical microscopes and high-quality CCD equipment, these methods allowed ﬂuorescence measurements more sensitive than those from contemporary ﬂow cytometers, and allowed scoring, quantiﬁcation and extraction of meaningful statistics from 1–2 ﬂuorescent protein molecules per pixel in single-cell images. We used these methods to calculate maturation rates of ﬂuorescent protein derivatives in single cells and develop single-image, ‘snapshot’ experiments to calculate degradation rates of ﬂuorescent protein derivatives in exponentially growing cultures.

RESULTS Open-source, microscope-based, time-course cytometry The method required capabilities to (i) image ﬁelds of living cells and return to each ﬁeld reliably over time, (ii) determine automatically the correct focus for each ﬁeld using a brightﬁeld image, (iii) automatically identify and track cells in the images, (iv) extract quantitative information from the tracked cells, and (v) analyze large data sets that comprise numerous measurements associated with individual cells. These capabilities rest on relatively simple microscope methods and, in two cases, on relatively sophisticated software. We detail in the Supplementary Note online the microscope methods, the relatively simple auto-

focus software and our use of a powerful open-source data analysis program, Physics Analysis Workstation (PAW), developed over the past 20 years at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). Here we brieﬂy describe the other software, Cell-ID 1.0 (Supplementary Software online)—which we wrote to track and identify cells—and how we used it to measure total cell ﬂuorescence, ﬂuorophore maturation rates as well as protein and mRNA decay rates. Cell-ID 1.0 uses brightﬁeld images to identify cells, assigns a unique identiﬁer number to each cell, scores interior and boundary pixels, tracks the cells through time-series of images and, in conjunction with ﬂuorescence images, calculates various cellular

Figure 3 | Total ﬂuorescence validation by comparison of Cell-ID–based measurements with ﬂow cytometry. We treated cells containing the PPRM1-YFP (strain ACLY387) construct with different concentrations of a factor for 90 min, ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, then washed twice in PBS and once in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA)3. We used samples from these populations to measure YFP-derived ﬂuorescence by microscopy using Cell-ID, and in parallel, by the LSR2 ﬂow cytometer (excitation, 488 nm; emmission, 510–530 nm). Plot shows distribution of the total ﬂuorescence in cells treated with 10 nM a factor. Data correspond to the median normalized ﬂuorescence.

measures (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 1 online). In general, the program identiﬁed all cells in a brightﬁeld image with only a few spurious or ‘false positive’ cells (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). To identify cells, Cell-ID takes advantage of a distinct feature of brightﬁeld images of yeast and other cell types. Notably, in images taken slightly below (100 nm) the focal plane, the boundary pixels were substantially darker than both the background of the visual ﬁeld and the interior of the cell. The program identiﬁed cell boundaries as pixels whose grayscale values fell below a cutoff that the program determined automatically and independently for each image. The program then segmented the brightﬁeld image into sets of contiguous pixels whose grayscale values were all above this cutoff. By using a brightﬁeld image to ﬁnd the cells instead of, for example, labeling the cells with a ﬂuorescent protein and using a ﬂuorescence image, we avoided bleaching the ﬂuorophores, and we avoided scoring brighter or more uniformly ﬂuorescent cells more efﬁciently. We also avoided a systematic error in the measurement of the cross-sectional area of the cells (and thus their volume, see Supplementary Note). To illustrate the utility of ﬁnding cells in brightﬁeld images, we altered Cell-ID to identify ﬂuorescent protein–labeled cells from ﬂuorescence images. For this ﬂuorescent protein mode, we identiﬁed cells as sets of contiguous pixels above a threshold, three s.d. above the background of the ﬂuorescence image. To compare both methods, we examined cells from a MATa bar1D strain in which a yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP) open reading frame (ORF) replaced the chromosomal PRM1 ORF, a gene induced by pheromone17. We induced expression of this gene with 20 nM pheromone for 30 min, halted protein translation by treatment with cycloheximide and allowed 3 h for ﬂuorophore maturation. We found that the calculated cross-sectional area of untreated cells (where ﬂuorescence is dominated by cellular autoﬂuorescence) was similar for both methods (data not shown), but increased for cells identiﬁed using ﬂuorescence images with respect to cells identiﬁed using brightﬁeld images as cells accumulated ﬂuorescent protein and became brighter (Fig. 1b). Occasionally, for brightﬁeld images, Cell-ID scored two nearby cells as a single cell. To address this problem, we developed an algorithm to identify pinch locations (bud necks or the location where two cells identiﬁed as one cell touched) and to quantify the degree to which the cells were pinched (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig. 1).

The segmentation algorithm should work well with cell types that are not highly irregular and produce dark outlines in brightﬁeld images. We veriﬁed this with cells from the promyelocytic lymphoid human cell line HL-60 (refs. 18–20; Fig. 1c). Notably, Cell-ID was able to ﬁnd these cells without modiﬁcation to the code. However, the cell-splitting algorithm discussed above may need to be modiﬁed for HL-60 cells undergoing cytokinesis as the algorithm was tuned for budding yeast, where new cells appear as small and growing buds. Cell-ID can be altered to accommodate different methods and cell types. We compare the implemented Cell-ID algorithm with other segmentation methods in the Supplementary Note. Measurement of total cell ﬂuorescence To quantify total cell ﬂuorescence, we summed the signal from pixels associated with each cell, and then corrected for the noncellular ﬂuorescence background, photobleaching and light originating from out-of-focus regions of the cell (Supplementary Note). To determine how well this method measured small numbers of ﬂuorescent protein derivatives, we replaced the chromosomal STE5 ORF with different numbers of PSTE5-YFP-STE5 genes (Fig. 2). In these strains YFP-Ste5 synthesis is under the control of the native STE5 promoter (PSTE5). Ste5 (ref. 21) exists in approximately 500 molecules per cell (Supplementary Note and K.R. Benjamin et al., unpublished data), and quantitative immunoblots (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Note) revealed that in the single-copy (‘‘1Â’’) strain, there are B500 YFP-Ste5 fusion molecules as well. We clearly distinguished ﬂuorescence from cells with one copy of the PSTE5-YFP-STE5 construct from cells that contained native STE5 but no ﬂuorescent derivative (‘‘0Â’’ strain; Fig. 2b). Because of the slow maturation of YFP (see below), the B500 molecules of YFP-Ste5 in exponentially growing cells consisted of B350 mature YFP ﬂuorophores and B150 not-yet-mature, and thus nonﬂuorescent, YFP molecules (Supplementary Note), indicating that we could quantify o350 ﬂuorescent proteins. Our cells covered B400

Indicated is the percentage of cells at the indicated dose of a factor that are bright enough to be distinguished from untreated (0 nM a factor) cells with 95% or better conﬁdence. Maximum values (at the highest doses of a factor) are less than 100% because some cells exhibit low ﬂuorescence even at high doses. These numbers depend on both the mean ﬂuorescence of a population and on the dispersion around the mean. Microscope-based cytometry with Cell-ID exhibits better sensitivity, showing better separation from untreated cells at low doses of a factor.

pixels in the CCD images, indicating that we could easily quantify roughly 1 ﬂuorescent protein per pixel in living cells. As the distribution in the 1Â strain is so distinct from that in the 0Â strain, the true sensitivity limit is even lower. The dominant limitation on sensitivity is uncertainty in the autoﬂuorescence of individual cells caused by cell-to-cell variation in autoﬂuorescence. It is possible that illumination with wavelengths that excited autoﬂuorescence but not YFP could be used for single-cell corrections. After correction for average autoﬂuorescence, the two- and four-copy strains had two and four times the average ﬂuorescence of the 1Â strain (Fig. 2c). They also had, on average, two and four times the amount of YFP-Ste5 protein, as measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 2a). Thus, these ﬂuorescence measurements increased linearly with the amount of the ﬂuorescent protein derivative, even at small numbers of molecules per cell. We compared these methods with analysis by one of the most sensitive presently available ﬂow cytometers, a BectonDickinson LSR2. We examined induced ﬂuorescence in cells that carried the pheromone inducible PPRM1-YFP construct, which contains the YFP gene under the control of the PRM1 promoter, at different pheromone doses. The population average of the microscope-acquired total ﬂuorescence measurement agreed with the ﬂow-cytometer measurements at all doses (Fig. 3). At low doses, where cells contained small numbers of ﬂuorescent proteins, however, the microscope methods were able to separate populations of cells treated with one dose from populations treated with another better, and also were

able to separate populations of untreated cells from treated cells better (Table 1). Measurement of ﬂuorophore maturation rate in single cells We quantiﬁed maturation time22,23 for YFP (wild-type GFP with mutations S65G,V68L,S72A,T203Y) and a cyan ﬂuorescent protein derivative (CFP; wild-type GFP with mutations F64,S65T,Y66W,N146I,M153T,V163A), in individual S. cerevisiae at 25 1C (ref. 3; Supplementary Note). We induced ﬂuorescent protein synthesis by addition of pheromone to cells with integrated constructs in which the ﬂuorescent protein replaced the PRM1 ORF, allowed transcription and translation to proceed for 30 min, then added cycloheximide to block translation. Cells reached maximum ﬂuorescence by 3 h after translation stop (Fig. 4a); and photobleaching-corrected ﬂuorescence (Supplementary Note) remained stable for up to 24 h (data not shown), indicating that under these conditions protein degradation was negligible. Although individual cells varied in the total amount of YFP by a factor of four (Fig. 4a), there was little cell-to-cell variation in the maturation rates (Fig. 4b; coefﬁcient of variation o 0.1; Supplementary Note). We performed an identical analysis for CFP (data not shown). In yeast under these conditions, YFP and CFP form mature ﬂuorophores at similar rates, with average halftimes for maturation of 39 ± 7 and 49 ± 9 min, respectively (Supplementary Note). We use these measurements to understand our snapshot experiments immediately below. We have also used them elsewhere to

understand time courses of induction of ﬂuorescent protein reporter genes3. Snapshot measurement of protein-degradation rates In exponentially growing cells, the population average number of ﬂuorescent protein derivatives (and other proteins) is constant over time24,25. Protein concentration depends on (i) production and degradation rates of the reporter mRNA, (ii) translation, maturation and degradation rates of the ﬂuorescent reporter protein, and (iii) population doubling time24–26 (Supplementary Note). We compared exponentially growing cells in which the constitutive promoter PACT1 drove expression of YFP to cells in which PACT1 drove an unstable derivative, YFP-ADH1tail (Supplementary Note, Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2 online). We calculated the ratio of the population average of total ﬂuorescence per volume of YFP-ADH1tail to stable YFP to be 0.15 ± 0.02. Because both genes were integrated into the same site in the chromosome and had the same promoter, and because their mRNAs differed by only a few bases (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 2), we assumed that their mRNAs had the same rates of synthesis, translation and degradation, and thus that the ratio depended on doubling time, protein degradation rate and ﬂuorophore maturation rate. We measured the increase in OD600 over time, determined the population doubling time to be 90 min for both strains and, from the experiments above, posited a degradation rate of 0 for YFP. We also made the assumption that the YFP domain of YFP-Adh1tail folded independently, so that the maturation rates for the YFP ﬂuorophores in these two derivatives were identical. From these assumptions and the ratio 0.15 ± 0.02, we calculated a YFP-Adh1tail degradation rate of (3.45 ± 0.40) Â 10À4 s–1 (t1/2 ¼ 33 ± 4 min; Supplementary Note). We veriﬁed this result by performing experiments in which we measured the degradation rate after blocking translation with cycloheximide (Supplementary Note and Fig. 4e). We obtained a degradation rate of 3.0 Â 10À4 s–1, which is close to the value we calculated from the ratiometric snapshot experiments. This result suggests that we could generalize this single-image snapshot method to produce a high-throughput determination of degradation rates of a large collection of YFP fusion proteins in exponentially growing cells. Snapshot measurement of an mRNA degradation rate We then used the snapshot method to calculate the degradation rate of a native yeast mRNA. We compared the ﬂuorescence from cells in which the STE5 promoter drove a native, nonfused YFP (PSTE5-YFP) with strains in which the same promoter drove a YFPSTE5 fusion (PSTE5-YFP-STE5). Fluorescence from the YFP-Ste5 cells was roughly sixfold lower than from the YFP cells (Fig. 2b). Because both proteins were expressed from the same promoter, we assumed that this difference in ﬂuorescence was not due to differences in transcription, but rather to differences in the stability of the mRNA or the protein. Two experiments suggested that ﬂuorescent protein–Ste5 derivatives were stable. In the ﬁrst experiment we added cycloheximide to the PSTE5-YFP-STE5 strain to stop protein translation and followed changes in ﬂuorescence in single cells every 10 min for 3 h. Fluorescence per cell did not diminish (data not shown). In the second experiment, we used strains expressing GFP or GFP-Ste5 under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. We induced expression by growing cells in 1% galactose and then switched expression off by addition of 2% glucose (Supplementary Note). After promoter shutoff ﬂuorescence in both strains decreased in a manner quantitatively explained by protein dilution from cell proliferation, consistent with a lack of protein degradation (Fig. 2d). The PSTE5-YFP and the PSTE5-YFP-STE5 mRNAs had identical 5¢ untranslated regions (Supplementary Note). We posited that these mRNAs were translated with equal efﬁciency and that the YFP mRNA was stable. Thus, the ratio of the average ﬂuorescence concentration of PSTE5-YFP-STE5 cells to PSTE5-YFP cells depended only on doubling time and mRNA degradation rates (Supplementary Note). We measured a ﬂuorescence ratio of 0.17 and, from OD600 measurements, doubling times of 90 min (data not shown), which allowed us to calculate a YFP-STE5 mRNA half-life of 18 min. This value agrees with a previously reported measurement of 14 min (12–17 min at 95% conﬁdence) for STE5 mRNA half-life27. DISCUSSION In addition to the sensitive ﬂuorescence measurements described here (sensitivity slightly better than one of the best-available ﬂow cytometers), this combination of relatively simple microscopebased cytometric methods has also allowed us to measure loss of ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between regulatory proteins in the nucleus and relocalization of ﬂuorescent proteins in response to pheromone system activation (R. Yu et al., submitted) and to calculate correlations among several cellular variables (for example, cell volume, rate of volume increase and ﬂuorescentprotein reporter output) to untangle and measure different sources of cell-to-cell variation after system activation3. Although we tuned Cell-ID to work with yeast cells, it readily identiﬁed mammalian lymphoid cells, which are regularly shaped and produce dark outlines in brightﬁeld images. We believe the method Cell-ID used to separate incorrectly combined cells should work for other cell types with relatively regular features, such as bacteria or lymphocytes, but would require some modiﬁcation for cells with more complicated processes, such as neurons and ﬁbroblasts. These methods allowed us to measure ﬂuorescent protein ﬂuorophore maturation rates in vivo in single cells. Although there was considerable cell-to-cell variation in the levels of ﬂuorescent protein expressed, as expected2,3, there was little (o10% of the mean) cell-to-cell variation in the maturation rates, consistent with the idea that maturation requires only intramolecular interactions23,28 and may be mostly independent of the internal physiological state of the cells. We speculate that part of the small cell-to-cell variation may be caused by cell-to-cell differences in intracellular redox state. Our ‘‘snapshot’’ calculations of protein and mRNA degradation rates required side-by-side comparison of single time point images of experiment and control cells in exponentially growing cultures. To justify the assumptions for these measurements, we measured protein stability by secondary experiments. In the future, however, we could build on the work of others29 to obviate the need for secondary experiments. For example, for Ste5 we imagine a cell that expresses a CFP-ubiquitin(K48R)–YFP-Ste5 fusion. The CFP-ubiquitin(K48R) moiety should be rapidly cleaved from the YFP-Ste5

part of the protein by the cellular ubiquitin proteases to yield a stable protein, CFP-ubiquitin(K48R), which should serve as an internal control for YFP-Ste5 stability. Because both protein moieties are encoded by the same message, their relative ﬂuorescence would be independent of the rate of mRNA degradation. By this means, we imagine that technically simple snapshot experiments could be scaled up to permit whole-genome measurements of mRNA and protein lifetimes, under different growth conditions, genetic modiﬁcations and experimental treatments. Because such measurements provide a means to measure steady-state mRNA and protein degradation rates in exponentially growing cells, they should complement pulse-chase30–32, chemical synthesis inhibition33, promoter shut off and temperature-shift synthesis inhibition experiments. High-throughput optical microscope–based cytometry complements ﬂow cytometry by allowing repeated measurements of the same cells over experimental time courses. Although there are commercial microscopy packages that provide considerable functionality, we believe that much important future methods development will involve open-source methods. Programs such as Cell-ID and CellProﬁler provide means to extract information from ﬁelds of cells, and that data can be further analyzed by powerful packages such as PAW. The OME provides metadata standards for archiving and working with large numbers of images, and the mManager image acquisition software project will provide the ability to operate microscopes and associated devices. Combinations of such software should help future researchers quantify new features of biological image data. METHODS Construction of strains and plasmids. We detail construction of yeast strains and plasmids, and methods for quantifying proteins by western blots in the Supplementary Note. Microscopy. To prepare yeast cells for microscopy, we maintained cultures in exponential growth for at least 15 h in BSM medium (Qbiogene, Inc.) with 2% glucose. To coat wells (96 MicroWell Optical Bottom Plate #1.5 Coverglass Base; Nalge Nunc International) with concanavalin A (type V; Sigma-Aldrich), we added to each well 100 ml of a 100 mg/ml solution of conA in water, incubated for 1 h at room temperature (18–23 1C), and then washed 3 times with water. We kept coated wells in water for up to 2 d before adding cells. After allowing 10 min for cells to settle and stick to the well bottoms, we washed away unbound cells. We maintained HL-60 cells at 37 1C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (SigmaAldrich) and 4 mM glutamine. Immediately before imaging, we transferred aliquots of cells to a 96-well glass-bottom plate. To acquire images we used a 60Â PlanApo objective with oil immersion (numerical aperture, NA ¼ 1.4) in a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope located in a 25 1C room. This microscope had automatic z-axis control, a motorized ﬁlter cube changer, a 100-W mercury arc lamp (HBO 100; Bulb Direct), brightﬁeld and epiﬂuorescence illumination electronic shutters (Uniblitz, Vincent Associates, and Smart Shutter, Sutter Instrument Company, respectively), a motorized x-y stage (MS-2000 stage, Applied Scientiﬁc Instrumentation), and a 512BFT MicroMax Peltier cooled CCD camera (Photometrix).
