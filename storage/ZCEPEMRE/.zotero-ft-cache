Fluorescently labelled MDCK-pTR GFP-RasV12 cells (CMPTX) were cultured with non-transformed MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100 on collagen gels, followed by tetracycline treatment. Red arrows indicate a fluorescently labelled RasV12 cell. b Apically extruded RasV12 cells form multicellular aggregates that dynamically move over the apical surface of the nontransformed cells. GFP-RasV12 cells mixed with non-transformed MDCK cells were seeded on collagen. Once a monolayer was formed, RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline and cells were monitored using time-lapse microscopy.

Supplementary Movies

Movie S1 This movie shows the extrusion of GFP-RasV12 cells from a monolayer of normal MDCK cells, seeded on collagen gels. GFP-RasV12 cells were prestained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Once extruded, the RasV12 cells remain viable and proliferate to form a multi-cellular aggregate that loosely attaches to and moves above the normal MDCK monolayer. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 48 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 3 MB)

Movie S2 This movie shows that a GFP-Rap1V12-expressing MDCK cell is not extruded from a monolayer of normal MDCK cells on collagen gels. GFPRap1V12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-Rap1V12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 24 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 2.7 MB)

Movie S3 This movie shows that GFP-RasV12 MDCK cells are not extruded from a monolayer of GFP-RasV12 MDCK cells on collagen gels. GFP-RasV12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with non-stained GFP-RasV12 cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment. Time-lapse images were captured at 10-min intervals for 24 h, with fluorescent images captured every 30 min. (QuickTime; 1.2 MB)

Movie S4 This movie shows that a non-extruded GFP-RasV12 cell in a monolayer of normal MDCK cells forms dynamic basal protrusions. GFP-RasV12 cells were pre-stained with fluorescent dye and mixed with normal MDCK cells at a ratio of 1:100. Once a monolayer was formed, GFP-RasV12 expression was induced with tetracycline at the beginning of the experiment.

Supplementary Discussion First, we would like to discuss the molecular mechanism of apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. We have not observed F-actin accumulation at the interface between normal and RasV12 cells (Fig. 2a and d), indicating that apical extrusion of RasV12 cells is not induced by “squeezing out” from the surrounding cells as observed in apical extrusion of apoptotic cells1. The PI3 kinase pathway is involved in lamellipodia formation and PI3K inhibitor does not affect apical extrusion (Fig. 2f), suggesting that apical extrusion is not due to increased migration of RasV12 cells. Then, how are RasV12 cells apically extruded when surrounded by normal cells? By analysing RasV12 cells that have not yet been extruded and have remained in the monolayer of normal cells, we have found that phosphorylation of myosin light chain is enhanced in RasV12 cells (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b and c) and that F-actin is accumulated at the intercellular junctions between RasV12 cells (Fig. 2a and d; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7f). Activation of myosin-II and intercellular F-actin accumulation would enhance surface tension and cell-cell adhesions of RasV12 cells, respectively2. Interestingly, these two parameters have been reported to be involved in cell sorting2-6; cells with higher surface tension and/or intercellular adhesions are thermodynamically encompassed by cells with lower tension and/or adhesions. Thus, the modulation of cytoskeleton that we have observed in RasV12 cells would promote RasV12 cells to selfaggregate in a monolayer of normal cells as a physically favoured process. We

have also observed that the height of RasV12 cells is enhanced when surrounded by normal cells (Fig. 2a and b), indicating that forces along the apico-basal axis are generated inside RasV12 cells. Since the presence of matrix on the basal side physically blocks basal movement of RasV12 cells, forces toward the apical direction will drive RasV12 cells to be apically extruded. We have further investigated the physical properties of normal and RasV12 cells by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)(Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). Utilising simultaneous AFM and fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9a), we have directly measured the apparent cell viscosity (µ) and the membrane elasticity (or Young’s Modulus)(E) of RasV12 and surrounding normal cells. We have found that RasV12 cells have significantly greater µ (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9b and c) and E values (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9d) than the surrounding normal cells do, indicating that RasV12 cells are stiffer and more viscous than normal cells. These parameters in RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells are not significantly different from those in RasV12 cells in a monolayer of RasV12 cells, suggesting that these physical properties are regulated in a cell-autonomous fashion. Notably, these mechanical parameters are significant in determining cell packing and geometry according to the recently proposed vertex model for cell organisation within an epithelial monolayer7. Based on this recent model, we suggest that energetic driving forces may play a vital role in the aggregation (and possibly extrusion) of RasV12 cells within the normal cell monolayer.

In Supplementary Information, Fig. S5, we present our analyses on cell-cell contacts at the interface between RasV12 and non-transformed cells. Components of adherens junctions, E-cadherin, β-catenin and p120-catenin, show incomplete or punctate immunostaining at cell-cell contacts where RasV12 cells extend a protrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a-c; data not shown for p120). Frequently, E-cadherin and β-catenin localise in vesicular puncta within the protrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5d; data not shown for β-catenin). Localisation of tight junction protein ZO-1 is not affected by protrusion formation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a and b, white arrowheads), indicating that Ecadherin-based cell-cell contacts are specifically disrupted. Both adherens junctions and tight junctions are maintained between RasV12 cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a and b, white arrows), suggesting that loss of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion specifically occurs at the interface between RasV12 and non-transformed cells. We therefore ask whether loss of E-cadherin is sufficient to induce protrusion formation by knocking down E-cadherin protein in MDCK cells using a tetracycline-inducible shRNA system (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5e). No protrusion formation is observed at the interface between normal and E-cadherin-deficient MDCK cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5f), indicating that loss of E-cadherin alone does not lead to protrusion formation but additional Ras-mediated signalling is required. We show in Fig. 4c that ROCK and Cdc42 are crucial in determining the fate of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells; either apically extruded, or

remaining in the monolayer and forming basal protrusions. Expression of dominant negative ROCK suppresses RasV12-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7b and c), suggesting its role in activation of myosin-II. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other pathways may also be involved in the regulation of myosin-II. ROCK can be activated by active Rho8-10. Interestingly, expression of p50RhoGAP, an inactivator of Rho11, significantly enhances apical extrusion of RasV12 cells (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7d), suggesting that some Rho downstream targets play a negative role in this process. It is feasible that Rho activity may be regulated locally or temporally, which affects its multiple downstream targets and the fate of RasV12 cells. In future studies, it remains to be clarified how the activity of ROCK and Cdc42 is regulated in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells. E-cadherin knockdown in cells surrounding RasV12 cells reduces the frequency of apical extrusion, while promoting basal protrusion formation and invasion (Fig. 5a-c). In addition, other data suggest that signalling pathways of surrounding normal cells can affect the behaviour of RasV12 cells. Expression of dominant negative Raf has no effect on the frequency of basal protrusion formation of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells (Fig. 4b), whereas addition of MEK inhibitor suppresses it (Fig. 3e). Expression of dominant negative ROCK substantially promotes protrusion formation of RasV12 cells (Fig. 4c), whereas addition of blebbistatin does not affect it (Fig. 3e). These data

indicate the involvement of basal activity of MEK and myosin-II of surrounding normal cells in this process. Collectively, our results suggest that the fate of RasV12 cells in a monolayer of normal cells is determined by the total balance of multiple signalling pathways in both RasV12 cells and surrounding normal cells. It is highly plausible that apical extrusion would suppress tumour formation and that basal protrusion formation and basal delamination would promote it. We expect that novel therapeutic treatment for cancer may be discovered by further studying the molecular mechanisms of apical extrusion and basal protrusion formation of transformed cells. Finally, in MDCK cells, we have found that expression of v-Src highly promotes apical cell extrusion (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8), but not basal protrusion formation (data not shown). Apical extrusion is observed in cells expressing either RasV12 or v-Src that stimulate distinct downstream targets. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate whether common signalling pathways are involved in these processes. Overexpression of Myc induces neither apical extrusion nor basal protrusion formation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8, and data not shown). These data suggest that different oncogenic stimuli induce different phenomena between normal and transformed cells, as previously shown in Drosophila melanogaster12, 13. In future studies, it should be examined whether deregulation of other oncoproteins or tumour suppressor proteins induces distinct phenomena at the interface with normal cells and how those phenomena are involved in the early stage of carcinogenesis in vertebrates.

MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and ambient air supplemented with 5% CO2. To establish MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-RasV12 in an inducible manner, a Tet-ON system was used. Briefly, MDCK cells were transfected with pcDNA6/TR using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), followed by selection in medium containing 5 µg ml-1 of blasticidin (Invitrogen). pcDNA4/TO/GFPRasV12 was then used for the second transfection and the doubly transfected cells were selected in medium containing 10% FCS (tetracycline-free) (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), 5 µg ml-1 of blasticidin and 400 µg ml-1 of zeocin (Invitrogen). MDCK cells stably expressing GFP and GFP-Rap1V12 were produced under the same conditions. To induce GFP, GFP-RasV12 and GFPRap1V12 expression, 2 µg ml-1 tetracycline was added to culture medium. After the establishment of the RasV12 cell line, we confirmed that the expression level of GFP-RasV12 was uniform between cells as follows; we plated RasV12 cells sparsely and established more than 30 independent clones isolated from single cells. By comparing the expression of GFP-RasV12 between the clones by

Western blotting, we confirmed that GFP-RasV12 is indeed expressed at the same level in the RasV12 cell line we have used for the experiments. For transient expression experiments (Fig. 4a-c; Supplementary Information, Fig. S6-8), MDCK cells were first seeded on collagen-coated coverslips in 6-well culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 7 x 105 cells per well. On the following day, cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (2 µg per construct) using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were fixed and immunostained as described below. In Supplementary Information, Fig. S7a, following 4 hr of transfection, MDCK cells transiently transfected with constitutively active Rho (Myc-RhoV14) were further incubated with or without Y27632 for 18 h. MDCK cells stably expressing E-cadherin shRNA in a tetracycline-inducible manner were produced as follows; E-cadherin shRNA oligonucleotides (E-Cad shRNA-1; 5'GATCCCCGGACGTGGAAGATGTGAATTTCAAGAGAATTCACATCTTCC ACGTCCTTTTTGGAAA-3' and 5'AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGACGTGGAAGATGTGAATTCTCTTGAAATTCAC ATCTTCCACGTCCGGG-3', and E-Cad shRNA-2; 5’GATCCCCGTCTAACAGGGACAAAGAATTCAAAGAGATTCTTTGTCCC TGTTAGACTTTTTC-3’ and 5’-

TM

Pro (Biontex, Germany), followed by selection in medium containing 5 µg ml-1

of blasticidin and 800 µg ml-1 of G418 (Calbiochem). More than two stable clones were obtained for two independent shRNA oligonucleotides. Knockdown of Ecadherin was analysed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting following 96 h incubation with tetracycline (2 µg ml-1). It should be noted that comparable effect of E-cadherin knockdown on protrusion formation or apical extrusion was observed in cells expressing E-cadherin shRNA-1 or -2. Cells were plated as described below, except where indicated as low-density cells were plated at 1 x 105 cells in 6-well culture dishes.

Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence of cells cultured on serum-coated glass coverslips was performed as previously described17. Cells cultured on collagen gels were examined using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope and Leica Application Suite (LAS) software. Cells cultured on glass coverslips were examined using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 MP system mounted on a Nikon 800 microscope using Lasersharp software (Biorad). Images were analysed using ImageJ 1.36b (National Institute of Health) or Volocity software (Improvision).

Cell height (from apical to basal membranes) and F-actin accumulation at cell-cell contacts were both quantified using Metamorph 6.0 digital analysis software (Universal Imaging)(Fig. 2b and d; Supplementary Information, Fig. S7e and f). To determine the level of F-actin at cell-cell contacts, a defined region was created to encompass the area of a cell-cell contact in xz confocal sections. The total pixel intensity within this region (200 pixels) was determined. For quantification of apical extrusion of GFP-RasV12 cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors (Fig. 2f), GFP-RasV12 cells in groups > 3 cells were examined. Minor and major protrusions were counted as less or greater than 10 µm in length, respectively (Fig. 3d). To determine the amount of GST-WASP-CRIB (Fig. 4e) or p-MLC (Supplementary Information, Fig. S7c) in GFP- or GFP-RasV12-expressing cells, Metamorph 6.0 digital analysis software (Universal Imaging) was used. Briefly, a defined region was created in the cytoplasm of the indicated cells in xz confocal sections. For each cell, 5 (for GST-WASP-CRIB) or 8 (for p-MLC) regions were created. The total pixel intensity within each region (73 pixels) was determined and the mean pixel intensity was calculated for each cell. In Fig. 5c, GFP-RasV12 cells or normal MDCK cells that were apically extruded, basally delaminated or formed basal protrusions were counted and expressed as a ratio relative to total cells. Cells were counted following 24 h of tetracycline addition, however MDCKpTR E-cadherin shRNA cells were incubated with tetracycline for 72 h prior to mixing with other cells to induce sufficient knockdown of E-cadherin protein. In Supplementary Information, Fig. S5c, the correlation between protrusion

formation and E-cadherin or β-catenin mis-localisation was quantified as follows. Cell-cell contacts between RasV12 and normal MDCK cells were first identified using F-actin staining at the contact site. When 50% or less of the contact site was stained with E-cadherin or β-catenin, it was counted as broken or punctate. Conversely, cell-cell contacts with > 80% E-cadherin or β-catenin staining were counted as linear.

Atomic Force Microscopy. A JPK AFM (Nanowizard I) was used for all experiments with MSCT-AUHW cantilevers (14±1 pN/nm). The AFM was mounted on an inverted Olympus IX71 phase contrast and fluorescence microscope for simultaneous optical imaging and mechanical analyses. Force curves were measured at 1 Hz and analysed with the Hertz model to determine cortical elasticity for a 500-nm indentation18. Stress-relaxation experiments were performed in constant height mode and the vertical deflection sampled at 10 Hz. Data were fit with a stress-relaxation model (in the limit of a conical indenter) according to previous methodologies19, 20 to determine the apparent viscosity of the cell.

Statistical analyses. Student’s t tests were used to determine P value because this test requires variables with no fixed limits.
