Abstract The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is crucial for the development of many organisms and its inappropriate activation is involved in numerous cancers. HH signal controls the traffic and activity of the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), leading to the transcriptional regulation of HH-responsive genes. In Drosophila, the intracellular transduction events following SMO activation depend on cytoplasmic multimeric complexes that include the Fused (FU) protein kinase. Here we show that the regulatory domain of FU physically interacts with the last 52 amino acids of SMO and that the two proteins colocalize in vivo to vesicles. The deletion of this region of SMO leads to a constitutive activation of SMO, promoting the ectopic transcription of HH target genes. This activation is partially dependent of FU activity. Thus, we identify a novel link between SMO and the cytoplasmic complex(es) and reveal a negative role of the SMO C-terminal region that interacts with FU. We propose that FU could act as a switch, activator in presence of HH signal or inhibitor in absence of HH. © 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The Hedgehog signaling proteins act as key morphogens during the development of many organisms as diverse as flies and human (for review see Huangfu and Anderson, 2006; McMahon et al., 2003). In most cases, HH proteins control cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and death in a dosedependent fashion. In human, disruption of this pathway is associated with congenital abnormalities, and its inappropriate activation plays a central role in the initiation and progression of numerous forms of cancer (for review see Lau et al., 2006; Pasca di Magliano and Hebrok, 2003). HH exerts its influence

on cells through a signaling cascade that ultimately regulates the expression of target genes that encode other signaling proteins such as Decapentaplegic (DPP)/TGFβ or Wingless (WG)/ WNT, transcription factors such as Engrailed (EN) and the HH receptor Patched (PTC). These transcriptional effects are mediated by zinc finger transcription factors of the GLI family (such as Cubitus interruptus (CI) in fly), which have both repressing and activating functions (Alves et al., 1998; Aza et al., 1997; Motzny and Holmgren, 1995; Nguyen et al., 2005). CI itself is found in at least three forms: a full-length form (CIFL), which is a transcriptional activator, a highly potent and labile activator form (CI-A) and a cleaved form (CI-R), which is a transcriptional repressor. A number of proteins are known to be involved in the control of CI, including the HH receptor PTC (a twelve-pass transmembrane protein) (Nakano et al., 1989), the seven-pass protein Smoothened (SMO) (Alcedo et al., 1996; van den Heuvel and Ingham, 1996), the kinesin-related protein Costal 2 (COS2) (Robbins et al., 1997; Sisson et al., 1997), the

F-box/WD protein SLIMB (Jiang and Struhl, 1998), a number of protein kinases (such as Fused (FU) (Preat et al., 1990), the protein kinase A (PKA), the casein kinase I (CKI) and the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) (for review see Price, 2006)) and the pioneer protein Suppressor of Fused (SU(FU)) (Pham et al., 1995). In the absence of HH signal, the pathway is silenced at multiple levels (for review see Hooper and Scott, 2005; Lum and Beachy, 2004): (i) PTC inhibits SMO, which is endocytosed and undergoes degradation in the lysosome (Denef et al., 2000; Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003); (ii) CI-FL is sequestered in the cytoplasm by both SU(FU) (Methot and Basler, 2000) and microtubule-bound complexes containing FU and COS2 (Stegman et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000; Wang and Jiang, 2004), leading to its cleavage into CI-R in a proteasomedependent fashion (Chen et al., 1999). In contrast, in HH receiving cells, HH binding to PTC alleviates its negative effect on SMO, which becomes hyper-phosphorylated and stabilizes at the plasma membrane (Denef et al., 2000). CI is then released from its cytoplasmic tethering, and its cleavage is inhibited, thus allowing it to transactivate HH target genes. Furthermore, in the cells exposed to the highest levels of HH, both FU and a positive input of COS2 promote formation of the highly potent CI-A form (Alves et al., 1998; Sanchez-Herrero et al., 1996; Wang and Holmgren, 2000). SMO has several structural and functional characteristics in common with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (Bockaert et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004), such as the ability to interact with β-arrestin (reported in vertebrates only) (Chen et al., 2004) and probably the capacity to dimerize (Hooper, 2003). Nevertheless, SMO displays some atypical features: it does not directly bind any known ligand, and no heterotrimeric G protein has been decisively implicated in the pathway. SMO activity is closely

associated with vesicle trafficking, since its targeting to the plasma membrane is sufficient to activate the pathway and endocytosis from the membrane to the lysosome can shut it down (Denef et al., 2000; Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003). Furthermore, SMO reportedly recruits the COS2/CI/FU cytoplasmic complex, probably via a direct interaction with COS2 (Jia et al., 2003; Lum et al., 2003; Ogden et al., 2003; Ruel et al., 2003), suggesting that SMO could directly affect the activity of this complex. Another positive key member of the HH pathway is the SerThr protein kinase FU. In embryos, FU activity is necessary for the HH-dependent transcription of wg during segment polarity establishment (Preat et al., 1990). In wing imaginal discs, it is required along the A/P boundary for the transcription of en (Alves et al., 1998; Sanchez-Herrero et al., 1996) and, to a lesser extent, of ptc and dpp (Glise et al., 2002; Lefers et al., 2001). In all cases, FU antagonizes the negative effects of SU(FU), thus facilitating the entry of CI-FL into the nucleus and allowing its activation in CI-A (Methot and Basler, 2000; Wang et al., 2000). It is composed of two domains: a N-terminal catalytic domain (called FU-KIN) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (called FU-REG) (Fig. 1). FU itself is phosphorylated in response to HH stimulation (Therond et al., 1996b) and it can phosphorylate COS2 (Nybakken et al., 2002) and probably SU(FU) (DussillolGodar et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2005; Lum et al., 2003), both of them interacting with FU-REG (Monnier et al., 1998; Monnier et al., 2002). FU-REG is required for FU activity, but complex genetic interactions with su(fu) and cos2 indicate that it also participates in the down-regulation of the pathway in the absence of HH signal (Alves et al., 1998; Sanchez-Herrero et al., 1996). Here, we report that FU can interact directly with SMO in a HH-independent manner in vivo. Furthermore, a version of

Fig. 1. SMO and FU associate directly. FU is composed of a N-terminal catalytic kinase domain (FU-KIN) followed by a regulatory domain (FU-REG) (aa 306–805, pale grey). A two-hybrid screen with FU-REG as bait led to the identification of 15 different prey clones encoding parts of the SMO C-terminus (horizontal arrows). SMO is a membrane protein with 7 transmembrane domains, an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. The smallest region of SMO that is sufficient for its interaction with FU (FU-binding region or FU-BR) spans amino acids 985 to 1036 and is distinct from the COS2-binding region (COS2-BR, aa 557– 686) determined by a two-hybrid assay (Lum et al., 2003), and from a cluster of phosphorylation sites for the PKA and CK1 (PKA/CK1-PS, aa 667–747) that was shown to be involved in SMO activation (Apionishev et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). ext: Extracellular; int: intracellular.

SMO that lacks its FU interaction domain can induce an ectopic constitutive up-regulation of HH target genes such as dpp, ptc and also en whose expression is characteristic of a high level of HH signaling. Finally, we show that this hyperactivity is independent from the presence of endogenous SMO but partially dependent on the endogenous activity of FU. All together, our data provide evidence of a new link between SMO and the HHtransducing protein complex and reveal a novel level of negative regulation of SMO that is likely mediated by its association with FU.
Experimental procedures Plasmids
pUAST-smo ΔFU was derived from pUAST-smo (containing a wild-type smo cDNA, A.M. Voie and S. M. Cohen) as follows: unmethylated pUASTsmo was digested by XbaI, provoking a deletion from the 2718th nucleotide to the end of the smo ORF, instead of which a PCR fragment including nucleotides 2718 to 2931 was cloned. As confirmed by sequencing, the resulting construct corresponds to a deletion from the 977th codon to the end of smo ORF. pAct5C-smo-EGFP, pAct5C-smoΔFU-EGFP, pAct5C-mRFP-fu, pUASTm6GFP-fu and pAct5C-mRFP-cos2-expression vectors were constructed by the Gateway recombination method (Invitrogen). The coding sequences (without the termination codon) of smo, fu and cos2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR, and cloned in the entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO by directional TOPO Cloning. The resulting plasmids were checked by sequencing. The destination vectors pAWG (pAct5C-GW-EGFP), pARW (pAct5C-mRFPGW) (where GW is the recombination cassette) were built by T. Murphy and were a gift from him and pUAST-nterm-m6GFP (pUAST-m6GFP-GW) was built and given by A. Brand. All cloning steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. pDAhh was provided by S. Cohen.

formed in S2 cells as described in Worby et al. (2001) with minor modifications. Transfection of cells (Effectene reagent, Quiagen) with SMO-GFP and RFP-FU fusions was realized after 2 days and observation 2 days later.

Fly strains and genetics
Flies were raised at 25°C. Mutants and transgenic strains are described in the following references: MS1096 (chr. X (Capdevila et al., 1994)), 71B (chr. III (Brand and Perrimon, 1993)), da-GAL4 (chr. III (Wodarz et al., 1995)), hsp-flp; +/+; tub1 > CD2 > GAL4, UAS-GFP/TM3 (Pignoni and Zipursky, 1997), fu1, fuRX2 and fuM1 (Therond et al., 1996a). Two UAS-GFP-smo strains were used: one (chr. II, used in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6) was received from J. Jiang (Jia et al., 2003), and the other (chr. III, used in Figs. 5 and 3S) was obtained by mobilization of the UAS-GFP-smo from a strain donated by A. Zhu (Zhu et al., 2003) and chosen for the stronger expression of the transgene than in the original strain (based on eye color and in situ GFP detection). Transgenic, UAS-GFP-fu and UAS-smoΔFU strains were obtained following the standard P-element-mediated procedure. The UAS-GFP-fu construct was validated by rescue of different fu mutants (Supplementary data, Fig. 1S). Five UAS-smoΔFU strains were obtained, and they all induced a higher de-regulation of the pathway than the UAS-smo control strains. The same insertion (called T45F) was used in all figures. For clonal overexpression, hsp-flp; +/+; tub1 > CD2 > GAL4, UAS-GFP/ UAS-smo or pUAS-smoΔFU third instar larvae were heat-shocked for 1 h at 37°C. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) (Lee and Luo, 2001) was done in larvae issued from crosses between UAS-CD8-GFP, hsp-flp; tub gal80, FRT40A; tub GAL4/TM6B females (a gift from S. Cohen) and FRT 40A smoD16/CyO; UAS smoΔFU (T4-5F)/TM6B males.

Imaginal discs immuno-staining
Imaginal discs from third instar wandering larvae were dissected in PBS; fixed 30 min at room temperature (RT) in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and permeabilized 3 times for 10 min in PBS + 0.3% Triton (PBST). They were incubated for 1 h in PBST + 2% BSA and then overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody, washed 3 times for 10 min with PBST, blocked for 1 h in PBST + 2% BSA and incubated for 3 h at RT with the secondary antibody (in PBST + 2% BSA). Finally, they were rinsed 3 times for 10 min in PBST before being mounted in Cytifluor. GFP was detected in disc merely fixed in paraformaldehyde, without any detergent. Primary antibodies were: anti-PTC, 1/100 (Capdevila and Guerrero, 1994), anti-EN, 1/1000 (4D9, from the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) (Patel et al., 1989)), anti-SMO, 1/1000 (20C6, from DSHB, Lum et al., 2003), rat anti-CI, 1/5 (2A1, Motzny and Holmgren, 1995), rabbit polyclonal anti-βgalactosidase, 1/1000 (from ICN/Cappel). The first three antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies. Secondary antibodies were from the Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory and were all used at 1/200.

Yeast two-hybrid cloning analysis
A cDNA fragment encoding the FU regulatory domain (aa 306 to 805) was cloned in the pB27 plasmid (Formstecher et al., 2005), derived from the original pBTM116 (Vojtek and Hollenberg, 1995). A random-primed cDNA library from Drosophila embryos (0–24 h) poly(A+) RNA was constructed into the pP6 plasmid derived from the original pGADGH (Bartel et al., 1993). The library was transformed into the Y187 yeast strain and ten million independent yeast colonies were collected, pooled and stored at − 80°C as equivalent aliquot fractions of the same library. The mating protocol has been described elsewhere (Rain et al., 2001). The screen was performed to ensure that a minimum of 50 million interactions were tested. The prey fragments from the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5′ and 3′ junctions on a PE3700 Sequencer. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding gene in the GenBank database (NCBI) by a fully automated procedure.

Fluorescence imaging and analysis
All presented images of wing imaginal discs were acquired using a LeicaSP2-AOBS microscope (NA 1,25, objective 40×). Excitation and emission settings were selected as follows: GFP (ex: 488 nm, em: 504–538 nm), Cy3, mRFP (ex: 543 nm, em: 555–620 nm), Cy5 (ex: 633 nm, em: 650– 750 nm). Images were sampled using a maximum xy pixel size of 100 nm, and z stack were acquired using a 2-μm sampling. Xz view reconstructions were obtained using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ 1997–2005). Cell culture images were acquired with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head coupled to a Leica inverted microscope (NA 1,4, objective 100×) (Leica, DMIRB). Excitation was achieved by using an Argon–Krypton RYB 75 mw Laser (Melles Griot). Images were acquired by using a CoolSnap HQ camera (pixel size 6.45 μm) (Princeton Instrument). The whole set up was driven by Metamorph 6.3 (Universal Imaging). The integration and wavelength switch module was designed by the firm “Errol” and the Institut Jacques Monod

Cell culture and transfection
Clone-8 (Cl8) cells were cultured as described in van Leeuwen et al. (1994). Cells were plated on concanavalin-coated cover glasses during 48 h. Transient transfections were carried out using FlyFectin (OZ bioscience). After 24-h incubation at 25°C, transfected cells were fixed 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. For RNA interference, double-stranded RNA was produced by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase on a PCR product corresponding to residues 2983–3603 of cos2. PCR primers included the T7 promoter: 5′ primer: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAGTGGAAGGAGCGTGTTCTGTCC and 3′ primer: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGTTTCGACGACTTGCGTCCTGGATAATTATCTTGTTCTTCTG.

Fig. 2. Subcellular localization of FU and SMO in vivo. Confocal images of wing imaginal discs (A–H) or salivary glands (I) of MS1096; UAS-GFP-smo (A–D) or MS1096; UAS-GFP-fu flies (E–I). (A) As reported for endogenous SMO and also shown in Fig. 3A′, GFP-SMO is preferentially stabilized in the posterior compartment. However, it also accumulates in the most anterior part of the wing pouch. Panels B–C are high magnifications across the anterior/posterior (A/P) boundary. Panel C is a confocal section acquired 24 μm below the section in panel B. SMO-GFP accumulates at the surface on the apical side (B), whereas it is in vesicular structures that are more scattered elsewhere (C). No difference between the anterior and posterior compartments can be seen at the apical side, whereas in the more basal region, bigger vesicles are present in the anterior compartment. (D) Xz view reconstruction of the wing pouch across the A/P boundary shows the preferential apical localization of SMO. (E) GFP-FU is more abundant in the wing pouch anterior compartment. (F–G) High magnifications of apical (F) and median (G) views of the anterior region of the wing pouch. Panel G is a confocal section acquired 38 μm below the section in panel F. FU is diffused in the cytoplasm, but also accumulates at the plasma membrane on the apical side (arrow in enlarged insert in the upper right corner of panel F), and in vesicular puncta in the more basal region (arrow in enlarged insert in the upper right-hand corner of panel G). (H) Xz view reconstruction of the wing pouch across the A/P frontier confirms the apico-basal distribution of FU. (I) In salivary glands, GFP-FU is present in the cytoplasm, in vesicle-like structures (arrow in enlarged insert in the lower right-hand corner). It also accumulates at the plasma membrane and in and around the nucleus (as also described in wing disc by Methot and Basler, 2000). All wing discs in this study are oriented with the anterior (Ant) to the left and the dorsal to the bottom. The A/P boundary is marked by an arrow head except in panels F and G, which are views of the anterior compartment. In all sections, scale bars equal 10 μm. Note that MS1096 is expressed at a higher level in the dorsal domain of the wing pouch (A and E).

imaging facility. Excitation and emission settings were selected as follows: GFP (ex: 488 nm, em: 495–525 nm), mRFP (ex: 568 nm, em: 580, 530). We processed vesicle segmentation using ImageJ intensity threshold and edge detection functions. To quantify the vesicular intensity fraction, the integrated intensity of vesicles was determined on each plane and the same procedure was used to determine total cytoplasmic fluorescence. Vesicular intensity fraction was obtained by calculating ratio of these two intensity values. To determine the proportions of green, red and co-labeled vesicles, we used the ImageJ 3D object Counter plugin (Fabrice Cordelières, Institut Curie, Orsay). We compared the binary images of both channels to estimate the monoor co-labeled vesicle state of 10 different cells. The distribution profile of co-labeled vesicles was analyzed by determining the Pearson coefficient on all pixels of these vesicles with the Mandels Coefficient plugin (Tony Collins, Cell Imaging Facility, University Health Network Research). To determine the robustness of the Pearson coefficient results, we did the same analysis after spatial randomization of the red channel using a fay translation method.

(Jia et al., 2003; Lum et al., 2003; Ogden et al., 2003; Ruel et al., 2003). In a two-hybrid screen using the last 500 amino acids of FU (amino acids (aa) 306 to 805, FU-REG) as a bait, one of the most frequently encountered partners corresponded to the SMO cytotail. Indeed, we identified 15 independent clones encoding SMO cytotail (Fig. 1). In comparison, 25 independent clones were found to encode COS2 and only 3 SU(FU) (Formstecher et al., 2005; http://pim.hybrigenics.com/pimriderext/droso/ index.html). All the SMO-encoding clones overlap and the smallest one defines a minimal region of SMO that is sufficient for its interaction with FU and corresponds to its last 52 amino acids (aa 985 to 1036). Thus, our data show that the SMO C-terminus can interact directly with FU. This interaction almost certainly occurs independently of COS2 in yeast, since no cos2 homolog is present in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Apical accumulation of SMO and FU in wing imaginal discs HH induces the stabilization of SMO and its relocalization from vesicles to the plasma membrane (Alcedo et al., 2000; Denef et al., 2000; Jia et al., 2003; Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003). In wing imaginal discs, FU was reported to be mostly cytoplasmic (Methot and Basler, 2000).

Results and discussion SMO C-terminus interacts with FU regulatory domain The intracellular C-terminal tail of SMO (SMO cytotail) has been previously shown to directly associate with COS2 and to co-immunoprecipitate FU, CI and, to a lesser extent, SU(FU)

Fig. 3. SMO and FU colocalization. (A–C) Wing imaginal discs of MS1096; UAS-GFP-fu flies were dissected, fixed, permeabilized with Triton (0.3%) before immunolabeling of SMO. GFP-FU (A, B, C) and endogenous SMO (A′, B′, C′) were sequentially detected by confocal microscopy. Panels B″ and C″ correspond to overlaps showing both proteins. (A–A′) Entire wing pouch: FU accumulates in cells of the anterior compartment (A), while SMO (A′) is more abundant in the posterior compartment. Panels B–B″ and C–C″ correspond to higher magnifications from median section of the anterior (B–Bʺ) and posterior (C–C″) regions. Colocalization of both proteins occurs in some vesicular structures (yellow arrows) present in both compartments. SMO/FU colocalization was also observed in S2 cells (see Fig. 4). (D–H) Cl8 cells transiently expressing mRFP-FU alone (D), SMO-GFP alone (E), SMOΔFU-GFP alone (F), mRFP-FU and SMO-GFP (G–G″) or mRFP-FU and SMOΔFU-GFP (H–H″). Red arrows correspond to mRFP-FU punctate structures, green arrows to SMOGFP or SMOΔFU-GFP vesicles and yellow arrows to vesicles co-labeled by both proteins. Note that no co-labeling can be observed between mRFP-FU and SMOΔFU-GFP. Scale bars equals 50 μm in panel A and 5 μm in panels B–H.

Here, in order to compare the subcellular localizations of SMO and FU, we monitored each protein tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expressed (using MS1096 driver) in the columnar epithelium of the wing imaginal disc and in the salivary glands (Fig. 2). GFP fluorescence was directly observed after fixation of the disc, without treatment by detergents to ensure that any intracellular structures that might be sensitive to these latter were preserved. As expected, GFP-SMO was mostly present in vesicles and at the cell surface (Figs. 2B and C). Anterior and posterior vesicles may differ in nature since they seem to differ in size, with larger vesicles in the anterior region. Furthermore, comparing different sections throughout the imaginal disc revealed that these vesicles were more abundant in the apical region of the cells. This preferential accumulation of GFP-SMO at the apical region was confirmed by xz view reconstruction (Fig. 2D). These results contrast with the accumulation of SMO at the baso-lateral surface reported by Denef et al. (2000). We checked the orientation of the discs by different methods (see Experimental procedures, Fig. 2S in Supplementary data and data not shown), and the same distribution was observed by immunodetection of endogenous SMO. Therefore, the discrepancy between our results and the published data is likely not due to the use of a fusion protein nor to overexpression conditions and is probably due to differences in the experimental conditions, either in the antibody or in the detergent used. After checking that the UAS-GFP-fu construct was indeed able to rescue the effect of fu mutants (see Experimental procedures and Fig. 1S in Supplementary data), we also monitored GFP-FU in wing discs. It preferentially accumulated in the anterior compartment (Figs. 2E and 3A), as it was reported for endogenous FU (Ruel et al., 2003). At the subcellular level, it was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and also accumulated both at the plasma membrane on the apical side and in scattered punctuate structures elsewhere in the cell (see xy sections in Figs. 2F and G and xz view reconstruction in Fig. 2H). In salivary glands, which are composed of large cells and have the capacity to respond properly to HH signal (Zhu et al., 2003), GFP-FU had a similar distribution (Fig. 2I). It was diffuse in the cytoplasm with a greater accumulation at the plasma membrane and in discrete puncta. Moreover, some accumulation was also seen in and around the nucleus, suggesting that FU might play a role in this compartment. In conclusion, both SMO and FU proteins can be found in punctuate structures. Furthermore, the enrichment of these FU or SMO structures in apical region of the cells likely reflects their polarized traffic towards the apical side where the extracellular HH signal is present. FU and SMO colocalize in vivo To better study SMO/FU colocalization, we pursued our analysis in transfected Cl8 cultured cells, whose size facilitates subcellular observations and which are capable of responding to the HH signal (Chen et al., 1999). We transiently expressed FU tagged with the monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein (mRFP-

FU) and SMO tagged with GFP (SMO-GFP), separately (Figs. 3D and E) or together (Figs. 3G–G″). Confirming the wing disc data, SMO alone accumulated in vesicles, while FU was present both diffusely in the cytoplasm and in small vesicle-like structures. We estimated that about 44% (± 13%) of total FU intensity accumulated in these structures (see Table 1). We did not determine the nature of the FU-containing punctuate structures, but they probably correspond to vesicles, since (i) published cell fractionation experiments have demonstrated that FU is indeed partially associated to the vesicular cytoplasmic pool (Ruel et al., 2003; Stegman et al., 2004), (ii) a large number of these structures also contain SMO (see below) which was shown to be vesicular (Nakano et al., 2004) and

(iii) their distribution is affected by HH signal (to be published elsewhere). FU co-expression did not significantly affect the localization of SMO. Conversely, while co-expression of SMO did not significantly change the fraction of FU in vesicular structures (40% ± 14%, see Table 1), the FU-containing structures appeared to be fewer but larger (Fig. 3G). According to the labeling profile (Fig. 3Gʺ), we estimated (Table 1) that 53% of the vesicles were co-labeled with both proteins (SMO+ FU+, yellow arrow), while 25% of vesicles contained only SMO (SMO+ FU−, red arrow) and 22% only FU (SMO-FU+, green arrow). Furthermore, we analyzed the colocalization in SMO+ FU+ vesicles by determining the distribution profile correlation using Pearson coefficient. We obtained a value of 0.845 ± 0.042 which, compared to the value of − 0.062 ± − 0.028 after randomization, shows a coherent distribution of both proteins and thus demonstrates their colocalization. Next, we followed both GFP-FU (driven by MS1096) and endogenous SMO in the wing imaginal discs (Figs. 3A–C″). The small size of the cells and the use of detergent, which somewhat reduced the detection of punctate FU and SMO (Figs. 3B–C″), made subcellular analysis more difficult. Nevertheless, in the posterior compartment (where HH is present), a large number of GFP-FU vesicle structures colocalized with endogenous SMO (Figs. 3C–C″). In the anterior compartment where HH is absent, FU was also present in SMO-containing vesicles, but due to a lesser accumulation of SMO, the signal was weaker (Figs. 3B–B″). In conclusion, in both cultured cells and wing imaginal discs, SMO and FU partially colocalize in vesicles. As shown for

(B–E) Wings resulting from the overexpression of UASGFP-smo (B, C) or UAS-smoΔFU (D, E) driven by 71B-GAL4 (B, D) or MS1096 (C, E). Wing in panel E comes from a dissected imago. Folds (represented by a star) are frequently encountered in the posterior compartment, probably due to differences in the sizes of the ventral and dorsal sides of the wing blade that result from a differential expression of MS1096 (see Fig. 2). Wings overexpressing SMO are enlarged with a widening of the LV3–LV4 intervein typical of an activation of the HH pathway at the A/P. These effects are not visible here for SMOΔFU, due to the strong morphogenetic defects of the entire wing, although they can be observed in the case of lower activation (see Fig. 6). Here and in Fig. 7, wings are oriented with the anterior to the top and the proximal end to the left. 2 to 5: LV2 to LV5.

COS2/SMO association (Ogden et al., 2003), colocalization of SMO/FU is not inhibited by HH (data not shown). The presence of FU in the vesicular structures lacking SMO might occur via COS2, since FU has been shown to interact and colocalize with COS2 (Monnier et al., 2002), which can associate with membranes in a SMO-independent manner (Stegman et al., 2004). SMO controls FU subcellular localization To examine the importance of the SMO/FU interaction in vivo, we designed a mutant of SMO (SMOΔFU) lacking its last 59 residues and thus its region of interaction with FU (see above). In Cl8 cells, SMOΔFU tagged with GFP is mostly vesicular (Fig. 3F), and its localization was unaffected by FU overexpression, like wild-type SMO. In contrast, SMOΔFU overexpression leads to a decrease in the fraction of vesicular FU intensity to 10% (± 7%) of total FU intensity (Table 1 and Fig. 3H). This reduction indicates that SMOΔFU can affect FU in a dominant negative fashion, probably by impeding its recruitment by endogenous SMO. Such an effect might reflect a dimerization between SMOΔFU and the endogenous wild-type SMO proteins, since it was previously suggested that SMO could homodimerize (Hooper, 2003). Alternatively, it might be due to the titration of a third partner that is possibly necessary for vesicular localization of FU. The percentage of vesicles containing SMOΔFU alone reached 88%, whereas only 10% of the vesicles contained FU alone and only 2% contained both proteins. Furthermore, as attested by a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.053 ± − 0.051 (compared with − 0.266 ± − 0.038 after randomization), no colocalization was seen within the few co-labeled SMOΔFU+ FU+ vesicles. In summary, the last 59 residues of SMO not only directly bind FU but are also necessary in vivo to recruit FU to vesicles. This suggests that the colocalization observed between SMO and FU is likely due to their interaction in vivo. The colocalization of SMO/FU might, however, be mediated by

their respective interactions with COS2. The FU-binding region of SMO (aa 985–1036) is distinct from its COS2-binding region (aa 557–686) previously defined by two-hybrid assays (Lum et al., 2003), but it is included within a region of SMO (aa 818–1035, SMO818–1035) that is sufficient to allow coimmunoprecipitation of COS2 (Jia et al., 2003), although this latter interaction was not shown to be direct. We expressed mRFP-COS2 alone or with either SMO-GFP or SMOΔFU-GFP in Cl8 cells (see Supplementary data, Fig. 3S). In all cases, mRFP-COS2 was present in punctate structures, but did not colocalize with SMO (or with SMOΔFU). However, in the presence of HH. mRFP-COS colocalized at the plasma membrane with either SMO or SMOΔFU, indicating that the last 59 amino acids of SMO are not required for SMO/COS2 colocalization. Last, we showed that SMO/FU colocalization was not affected when the accumulation of COS2 was strongly reduced by RNA interference (Fig. 4). For all these reasons, we conclude that it is very unlikely that endogenous COS2 bridges SMO and FU and that the colocalization of SMO/FU reflects their interaction in Cl8 cells. Thus, FU has the ability to directly bind both COS2 and SMO. Moreover, the co-expression of FU with SMO and COS leads to the localization of COS2 in SMO-containing vesicles (unpublished data). It is therefore likely that the reported co-immunoprecipitation between COS2 and SMO818–1035 occurs indirectly via their respective associations with FU (Jia et al., 2003). This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the amount of COS2 co-immunoprecipated with SMO was reported to be strongly increased by the coexpression of FU. Loss of the FU-interacting domain turns SMO into a potent constitutive activator It is clear that multiple interactions can take place between the SMO, FU and COS2 proteins (Jia et al., 2003; Lum et al., 2003; Monnier et al., 1998, 2002; Ogden et al., 2003; Sisson et al., 1997). Although such multiple associations might simply

play an architectural role in reinforcing the stability of the complex, it is also possible that each interaction plays a specific role. We assessed the functional relevance of SMO/FU interaction in vivo by comparing the effects of SMO and SMOΔFU overexpression on wing development. We used two drivers MS1096 and 71B, the latter also being broadly expressed, albeit at a lower level, throughout the wing pouch. As expected, GFP-SMO overexpression has a relatively mild effect, consistent with a low level of activation of the HH pathway in the anterior compartment of the disc: all the wings display extra cross-veins between the longitudinal veins (LV) LV2 and LV3, an enlargement of LV3–LV4 spacing and a thickening of vein LV3 (Figs. 5B–C). Similar effects were previously reported with various UAS-smo and UAS-GFP-smo transgenes (Hooper, 2003; Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003). In contrast, overexpression of SMOΔFU induces strong wing defects (Figs. 5D, E) characterized by numerous extra cross-veins and ectopic LV3 vein tissue with extra campaniform sensillae (data not shown) in the anterior compartment. Moreover, when the wing patterning was not too severely disturbed, an enlargement of LV3–LV4 intervein could also be observed (see Fig. 5B). The more severely affected flies could not emerge and the wings of the dissected imago were almost circular with the anterior region invaded by vein tissue (Fig. 5E). Such phenotypes are indicative of a high level of ectopic activation of the HH pathway and are similar to those reported for the overexpression of some gain of function smo mutants (Zhang et al., 2004). Multiple independent UAS-smo transgenes (wild-type and tagged versions) were tested in different laboratories and their expression led to low levels of HH pathway activation (independently from the presence or absence of the GFP moiety) (Hooper, 2003; Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004; Apionishev et al., 2005). One report indicates that, at most, one in six lines has an unusually high effect, due to a higher level of expression (Hooper, 2003). Here, for all SMOΔFU strains tested the effect was medium to high. We compared several independent smoΔFU and smo insertions (including a novel insertion which we selected for high expression). smoΔFU overexpression always induced a much stronger defect than wild-type smo overexpression (data not shown). Thus, the difference between SMO and SMOΔFU induced phenotypes is probably not due to differences in the levels of transcription of the transgenes. Immunodetection of SMO and SMOΔFU, revealed however, a difference in the levels of accumulation of the two types of proteins (data not shown). Indeed, as reported for other constitutively active forms of SMO, such as oncogenic SMO variants (Nakano et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003), for mutants of SMO that mimic constitutively phosphorylated SMO (Apionishev et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004), or a form of SMO stabilized at the membrane by fusion with a GAP anchor (Zhu et al., 2003), SMOΔFU protein accumulated at a higher level than the wild-type form of SMO. Normally, in HH-receiving cells at the A/P boundary, CI-FL accumulates and induces expression of dpp, ptc and en, whereas in the anterior part of the wing pouch, CI-R represses dpp and hh (Methot and Basler, 1999). Here, in response to over-

expression of SMO ΔFU (driven by MS1096), high levels of ectopic expression of dpp as well as ptc were seen in most of the anterior part of the wing pouch, which is itself greatly enlarged (Figs. 6B to B″). In contrast, as previously reported (Hooper, 2003; Jia et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 1989), overexpression of wild-type SMO led to only low levels of ectopic expression of dpp in the most anterior region of the wing pouch, and had little effect on the expression of ptc (Figs. 6A to A″, and data not shown). Furthermore, consistent with its action on HH targets, SMO ΔFU expression leads to a uniform level of CI-FL throughout the anterior compartment (compare Figs. 6E and F). We also expressed SMOΔFU in clones: transcription of ptc and en is activated in all clones located in the anterior compartment (even far from the posterior HH source) (Figs. 6C–C″, D–D″), indicating that a high level of activation can be reached away from the boundary. The effect of smoΔFU overexpression on anterior en expression contrasts with the failure of even the strongest smo transgenes to do so (Hooper, 2003) and provides further evidence of a difference in the activities of the SMO and SMOΔFU proteins. It could have been possible that this up-regulation of HH targets induced by SMOΔFU was a secondary effect of an ectopic hh expression resulting from a decrease in CI-R, but this was ruled out by the analysis of SMOΔFU overexpression in clones of cells which revealed that the high ptc and en expression of these clones is cell-autonomous (Figs. 6C–C″, D–D). Thus, the 59 amino acid long C-terminal truncation of the SMO cytotail seems to give rise to an activated, constitutive form of SMO. Another possibility is that SMOΔFU activating effects might simply rely on the sequestration or mislocation of antagonists of the pathway, thus allowing the activation of endogenous SMO. Therefore, we tested whether the effects of SMO ΔFU depended on wild-type endogenous SMO by monitoring the effects of smoΔFU expression in clones of cells mutant for smo. As shown in Figs. 6G–G″, SMOΔFU was still able to induce the expression of ptc and the accumulation of full-length CI in the absence of endogenous SMO protein. This indicated that the loss of the last 59 residues leads to the constitutive activation of SMO. Interestingly, a SMO variant whose last 96 amino acids had been deleted (SMOΔ939–1036) was shown to have an activity comparable to that of wild-type SMO (Nakano et al., 2004). Two regions of the SMO cytotail are thus defined: (i) a region that covers the last 59 amino acids which interacts with FU and inhibits SMO activity in the absence of HH, and (ii) a region that includes amino acids 939 to 977 which is necessary for SMOΔFU hyperactivity. None of these regions are required for the activity of full-length SMO in response to HH. In summary, our data show that the last 59 amino acids of SMO can inhibit its activity in the absence of HH signal. Since SMOΔFU has lost its capacity to interact directly with FU, we propose that this negative regulation of SMO might occur via its association with FU-REG. In this context, the weakness of wildtype SMO overexpression effects can be attributed to its negative control by endogenous FU. Note that such an effect might also partially account for previous genetic data showing

loss of the last 59 amino acids of SMO could lead to SMO hyperactivity independently from the loss of FU binding. Partial requirement of FU for SMOΔFU-induced activation of the HH pathway FU thus seems to be a negative regulator of SMO in the absence of HH signal, but extensive genetic and molecular analysis has established a clear positive regulatory role for FU as well (Alves et al., 1998; Preat et al., 1990, 1993). We assessed the participation of FU in the activating effects of SMOΔFU and SMO, by overexpressing these latter in a fu mutant background. fu wings display a longitudinal fusion of the LV3 and LV4 associated with a posterior expansion of the double row of marginal bristles (Therond et al., 1996b) (Fig. 7A). We first tested the effects of fuRX2, a fu allele lacking the last 57 codons of the fu coding sequence (Robbins et al., 1997). Strikingly, the phenotype induced by either SMOΔFU or SMO overexpression is suppressed in fuRX2 flies (Fig. 7, compare C with B and F with E). This effect is dosage-dependent since the loss of one dose of fu is sufficient to reduce the SMOΔFU - or SMO-induced phenotype (Fig. 7D). At the A/P boundary, however, the LV34 spacing is normal, indicating that, in this region, expression of SMOΔFU and SMO can still activate the pathway at a level sufficient to compensate for the effects of the fu mutation (Fig. 6, compare C and F with A). All these reciprocal suppressive effects are not specific to the fu allele: similar results (see Supplementary data, Fig. 5S and data not shown) were seen both with fuM1, which encodes only the first 80 amino acids of FU and is therefore unlikely to have a residual kinase activity, and with fu1, which has a missense mutation in the kinase domain of FU (Alves et al., 1998; Robbins et al., 1997). The suppression of the SMO or SMOΔFU-induced phenotypes in the fu mutants argues that FU is required for SMO or SMOΔFU effects on the HH pathway away from the A/P border, while the reciprocal suppression of the fu phenotype at the A/P boundary by overexpression of SMO or SMOΔFU argues that, when high levels of HH are present, a high level of activation can occur without FU. Thus, SMOΔFU and to a lesser extent, SMO, activate the HH pathway in both a FUdependent and a FU-independent manner. Although, the requirement for FU seems normally restricted to the AP border (where HH levels are highest) for the expression of genes such as en, the present data indicate that FU can also be necessary for ectopic activation of the pathway away from the AP border. We propose that FU's normal role is to enhance the level of activation of the pathway in response to HH and that it also does so in presence of high levels of SMO or SMOΔFU. The loss of FU activity combined with the activating effects of SMO or SMOΔFU overexpression result a wild-type phenotype. Lastly, our data also show that, in the absence of FU, SMO can be as potent an activator as SMOΔFU. Indeed, SMO seems to suppress the effects of fu mutations with a similar efficiency to SMOΔFU. This could reflect the incapacity of FU mutant proteins to bind and/or inhibit SMO. Since this is observed with different fu alleles which are all directly (fu1) or indirectly

The same results are also observed in fu1 and fuM1 mutants (see Supplementary data Fig. 5S).

(fuRX2, fuM1) impaired in their catalytic activity, we propose that the negative action of FU on SMO is likely mediated by its kinase activity. FU may, for example, phosphorylate SMO. Such an effect could prevent SMO activation by impeding its activating hyperphosphorylation by the PKA and the CKI (Apionishev et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). Conclusion HH signal appears to act mainly by alleviating or bypassing multiple inhibiting processes that stringently shut down the pathway in the absence of an adequate signal. This occurs through the tight control of the subcellular localization, composition and stability of protein complexes that link the transmembrane protein SMO to the regulators of the transcription factor CI. Here we report that SMO and FU can physically interact, leading to the direct recruitment of FU in SMOcontaining vesicles in the absence of HH signal. The deletion of the region of the SMO cytotail required for its interaction with FU leads to a constitutive activation of the pathway. Thus, our data suggest that FU, in addition to its known activator function, can also act as a negative regulator of SMO activity in the absence of HH signal (see the model in Fig. 8). Given that SMO activation by HH is known to involve both its hyperphosphorylation by PKA and CKI and changes in its traffic that lead to its stabilization, FU might inhibit SMO activation by acting on either of these stages. Via its dual role, FU may thus not only increase the robustness of the pathway, dampening any noise that might occur in the absence of any

signal, but also reinforce the bistable switch properties of the pathway (Lai et al., 2004). Acknowledgments We thank S. Cohen, I. Guerrero, J. Jiang, L. Ruel, F. Schweisguth, P. Thérond, C.

Fig. 8. A model for SMO and FU in the HH pathway. In the absence of HH signal, SMO's activating effects are prevented by its endocytosis and targeting to the lysosome. We propose that the last 59 amino acids of SMO participate in its inhibition to reinforce the inactivated state of the pathway in the absence of signal. FU's negative effects might rely on SMO association with FU, which could thus phosphorylate SMO to modulate its trafficking and/or to prevent its phosphorylation by the PKA and CKI. The detection of changes in SMO trafficking would require a better characterization of the vesicles containing the wild-type or truncated forms of SMO. In response to HH, the inhibitory effects of both PTC and FU would be alleviated, and SMO is activated. In this situation, FU acts as an effector of SMO and is required for full activation of CI. ext: Extracellular; int: intracellular.
