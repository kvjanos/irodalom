Macroautophagy	(which	we	will	call	autophagy)	is	a	critical	process	for	cellular	degradation	of	cytosolic	contents,	protein	complexes	and	organelles.	It	involves	the	formation	 of	 double-membrane	 structures,	 called	 autophagosomes,	 which	 engulf	 a	 portion	 of	 	 cytoplasm.	These	 autophagosomes	 ultimately	 fuse	 with	 lysosomes	 where	 their	 contents	 are	degraded.1 Autophagy	 has	 numerous	 functions.	We	 have	 shown	 that	 it	 is	 an	 important	 defense	 against	aggregate-prone	cytosolic	proteins	that	accumulate	in	a	range	of	neurodegenerative	diseases.2,3	These	include	polyglutamine-expanded	proteins	(in	Huntington’s	disease	 and	certain	spinocerebellar	ataxias),	point	mutations	in	a-synuclein	(in	certain	forms	of	 familial	Parkinson’s	disease)	and	tau	(in	frontotemporal	dementias).4-10	Upregulation	of	 autophagy	enhances	the	clearance	of	these	proteins	and	decreases	toxicity	in	mouse	and/or	 Drosophila	models	of	many	of	these	diseases.2,3 Another	 class	 of	 diseases	 that	 may	 benefit	 from	 strategies	 that	 enable	 autophagy	 upregulation	 are	 certain	 bacterial	 and	 viral	 infections,	 where	 the	 pathogens	 can	 be	 engulfed	by	autophagosomes	and	transferred	to	lysosomes	for	degradation.	These	include	 Mycobacterium tuberculosis	 (which	 causes	 tuberculosis),	 Group	 A	 streptococcus	 (which	 causes	 strep	 throat,	 toxic	 shock	 syndrome	 and	 necrotizing	 fasciitis),	 and	 viruses	 such	 as	 herpes	simplex	virus	type	I.11-14 The	best	characterized	brain-accessible	drug	that	upregulates	autophagy	is	rapamycin.3	 Rapamycin	 induces	 autophagy	 by	 inhibiting	 the	 target	 of	 rapamycin	 (TOR)	 proteins,	 which	 are	 well	 conserved	 from	 yeast	 to	 man.	 The	 mammalian	 TOR	 is	 called	 mTOR.	 Although	rapamycin	is	arguably	the	most	specific	kinase	inhibitor	known	to	date,	its	target	 also	 regulates	 numerous	 physiological	 processes	 that	 are	 independent	 of	 autophagy.15	 Indeed,	rapamycin	is	in	clinical	use	as	an	immunosuppressant	for	organ	transplantation,	 but	 the	 immunosuppressive	 actions	 of	 rapamycin	 preclude	 its	 use	 in	 infectious	 diseases	 such	as	tuberculosis.	Thus,	there	is	a	need	for	nonimmunosuppressive	autophagy-inducing	 drugs.	Such	drugs	may	also	be	preferable	for	neurodegenerative	diseases.	One	may	argue	 that	the	potential	benefits	of	rapamycin	treatment	in	currently	incurable	conditions	such	 as	 Huntington’s	 disease	 may	 outweigh	 the	 side	 effects.	 However,	 as	 any	 autophagy-inAutophagy	 2007;	Vol.	3	Issue	6

Upregulation of autophagy may have therapeutic benefit in a range of diseases that includes neurodegenerative conditions caused by intracytosolic aggregate‑prone proteins, such as Huntington’s disease, and certain infectious diseases, such as tubercu‑ losis. The best‑characterized drug that enhances autophagy is rapamycin, an inhibitor of the TOR (target of rapamycin) proteins, which are widely conserved from yeast to man. Unfortunately, the side effects of rapamycin, especially immunosuppression, preclude its use in treating certain diseases including tuberculosis, which accounts for approximately 2 million deaths worldwide each year, spurring interest in finding novel drugs that selec‑ tively enhance autophagy. We have recently reported a novel two‑step screening process for the discovery of such compounds. We first identified compounds that enhance the growth‑inhibitory effects of rapamycin in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we termed small molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs). Next we showed that three SMERs induced autophagy independently, or downstream of mTOR, in mammalian cells, and furthermore enhanced the clearance of a mutant huntingtin fragment in Huntington’s disease cell models. These SMERs also protected against mutant huntingtin fragment toxicity in Drosophila. We have subsequently tested two of the SMERs in models of tuberculosis and both enhance the killing of mycobacteria by primary human macrophages.

ducing	treatment	may	need	to	occur	over	decades,	a	safer	drug	would	 be	highly	desirable. We	 have	 recently	 described	 a	 novel	 pipe-line	 for	 the	 discovery	 of	 mTOR-independent	 compounds	 that	 induce	 autophagy	 	 (Fig.	 1).16	 We	 screened	 50,729	 compounds	 for	 their	 abilities	 to	 enhance	 or	 suppress	 the	 growth-inhibitory	 effects	 of	 rapamycin	 in	 yeast	 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).17	 As	 the	 mTOR	 pathway	 is	 conserved	 from	 yeast	 to	 man,	 our	 rationale	 was	 that	 the	 activities	 of	 some	 of	 these	 compounds	 would	 be	 conserved	 in	 mammalian	 systems,	 and	 that	 some	 may	 have	 an	 impact	 upon	 autophagy.	 From	 a	 structurally	 nonredundant	 set	 of	 21	 small-molecule	 inhibitors	 of	 rapamycin	 (SMIRs)	 and	 12	 small-molecule	 enhancers	 of	 rapamycin	 (SMERs),	 we	 identified	 3	 SMERs	 (SMER10,	 SMER18	 and	 SMER28)	 that	 are	 nontoxic	 and	 that	 induce	 autophagy	 in	 mammalian	 cells.16	 Autophagy	 substrate	 clearance	 such	 as	 mutant	 huntingtin	 and	 A53T	 a-synuclein	 is	 SMER	 dose-dependent	 and	 only	 occurs	 in	 wild-type	 Atg5	 (autophagy-competent)	 cells	 but	 	 not	 in	 Atg5	 knockout	 (autophagy-incompetent)	 cells.	 SMER-	 mediated	autophagy	induction	occurs	at	the	stage	of	autophagosome	 formation.16 SMERs	10,	18	and	28	appear	to	act	independently	of,	or	downstream	of,	mTOR.	They	did	not	result	in	a	decrease	of	mTOR	activity	 as	 seen	 with	 the	 positive	 control	 rapamycin.16	 Furthermore,	 these	 SMERs	in	combination	with	rapamycin	(at	concentrations	saturating	 for	its	pro-autophagic	activity)	resulted	in	greater	rates	of	autophagy	 substrate	 clearance,	 compared	 to	 either	 the	 SMERs	 or	 rapamycin	 alone.16	 An	 analogue	 series	 for	 each	 of	 the	 SMERs	 was	 developed

Figure 1. Schematic representation of identifying autophagy‑inducing small molecules and their potential therapeutic application. A primary yeast screen identified small molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs), on which a secondary screen was performed in mammalian cells to identify autophagy‑inducing SMERs. Three SMERs (SMERs 10, 18 and 28) were identified that induce autophagy independently of rapamycin. These SMERs increased autophagic vesicles, thereby enhancing the clearance of mutant huntingtin and reducing its toxicity in cell and fly models of Huntington’s disease. They also demonstrated additive protective effects with rapamycin. Further candidate drugs were identified by screening the structural analogs of these SMERs. The autophagy‑in‑ ducing SMERs also enhanced the clearance of mycobacteria.

in	order	to	assess	preliminary	structure-activity	relationships.	These	 analogues	revealed	a	further	18	compounds	that	enhanced	clearance	 of	different	autophagy	substrates.16 Compatible	with	expectations,	SMERs	10,	18	and	28	enhanced	 the	 clearance	 of	 mutant	 huntingtin	 fragments	 in	 cell	 models	 and	 protected	against	the	toxicity	of	this	polyglutamine-expanded	protein	 in	 both	 cells	 and	 Drosophila.16	 One	 question	 that	 we	 have	 started	 to	 address	 since	 these	 compounds	 were	 published	 is	 whether	 they	 can	 also	 enhance	 the	 clearance	 of	 mycobacteria.	 To	 date,	 we	 have	 completed	testing	SMERs	18	and	28	(which	had	the	highest	activity	 with	regard	to	clearance	of	the	other	autophagy	substrates	we	examined).	Both	these	SMERs	reduced	the	numbers	of	viable	intracellular	 mycobacteria	in	primary	human	macrophages	(Fig.	2). In	 conclusion,	 we	 have	 described	 a	 novel	 procedure	 for	 discovering	 autophagy-inducing	 drugs.16	 This	 is	 potentially	 scalable	 and	 may	 allow	 interrogation	 of	 larger	 small-molecule	 libraries.	 The	 compounds	 identified	 have	 potential	 utility	 for	 further	 development	both	for	neurodegenerative	diseases	and	for	certain	infectious	 diseases.	These	compounds	may	serve	as	probes	for	the	identification	 of	 novel	 regulators	 of	 mammalian	 autophagy,	 a	 process	 that	 is	 still	 poorly	understood.
