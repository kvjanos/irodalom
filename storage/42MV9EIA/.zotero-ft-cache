Supplementary Figure 1 Primary mammary cells orient their mitotic spindle perpendicular to an apical surface and form a lumen without involvement of apoptotic mechanisms (A) Orientation of cell-division in an expanding polarized acinus that is grown from primary non-transgenic mammary cells. One cell in anaphase is dividing with the two sets of chromosomes perpendicular to the lumen, which can be appreciated in the bottom panels; 6 adjacent projections (4µm each) cover the region of the sphere (from upper left panel to lower right panel); DAPI stain, blue; β-tubulin, green; γ-tubulin, red. Scale bar, 20µm (B) Another example for the orientation of cell-division in an expanding polarized acinus that is grown from primary non-transgenic mammary cells. One cell in anaphase is dividing with the two sets of chromosomes perpendicular to the lumen (right panels). The front part of the acinus has been cut in the 3D reconstruction to better appreciate the ZO1 lined lumen. Panels display cuts with a second optical layer at different levels (left panel: lower level; middle panels: intermediate levels; right panel: whole acinus) to appreciate the lumen and the orientation of the cell in anaphase that is located at the top of the structure. DAPI stain, blue; ZO1, green; beta-tubulin, red. Scale bar, 20µm.
