SUMMARY

High-content screening for gene proﬁling has generally been limited to single cells. Here, we explore an alternative approach—proﬁling gene function by analyzing effects of gene knockdowns on the architecture of a complex tissue in a multicellular organism. We proﬁle 554 essential C. elegans genes by imaging gonad architecture and scoring 94 phenotypic features. To generate a reference for evaluating methods for network construction, genes were manually partitioned into 102 phenotypic classes, predicting functions for uncharacterized genes across diverse cellular processes. Using this classiﬁcation as a benchmark, we developed a robust computational method for constructing gene networks from high-content proﬁles based on a network contextdependent measure that ranks the signiﬁcance of links between genes. Our analysis reveals that multi-parametric proﬁling in a complex tissue yields functional maps with a resolution similar to genetic interactionbased proﬁling in unicellular eukaryotes—pinpointing subunits of macromolecular complexes and components functioning in common cellular processes.

that execute cellular processes. Approaches to do this combine systematic gene inhibition with functional tests that span a continuum—from single readout assays to complex assays that interrogate a broad spectrum of cellular processes. Whereas single readout assays identify pathways that impact a speciﬁc process (Mathey-Prevot and Perrimon, 2006), complex assays can be used to construct functional networks from collections of genes with diverse cellular roles. Two approaches have emerged for distilling complex phenotypes for phenotypic proﬁling: genetic interaction proﬁling and high-content screening. Although the methodologies are distinct, both strategies translate the consequences of inhibiting gene activity into phenotypic proﬁles that can be compared to generate a map of the functional relationships between genes (Boone et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2009; Conrad ¨ and Gerlich, 2010; Piano et al., 2002; Sonnichsen et al., 2005). Genetic interaction proﬁling was pioneered in budding yeast, using a comprehensive deletion library of non-essential genes and collections of hypomorphic alleles of essential genes (Boone et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2009). Genetic interaction proﬁling captures the consequences of inhibiting a gene by measuring the effect on growth rate of pairwise inhibitions with each of the other genes in the collection. This analysis generates quantitative interaction proﬁles for each gene that can be clustered to reveal functionally signiﬁcant relationships. A genome-scale genetic interaction map was recently constructed for S. cerevisiae (Costanzo et al., 2010), and maps have also been generated for subsets of gene implicated in speciﬁc processes—such as RNA processing, chromosome biology, proteasome function, and the secretory pathway (Breslow et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2007; Schuldiner et al., 2005; Wilmes et al., 2008).

In metazoans, genetic interaction proﬁling is difﬁcult to implement because comprehensive libraries of deletion/hypomorphic strains do not exist and developing reproducible high-throughput methods to quantify ﬁtness is a formidable barrier (Gunsalus, 2008). Consequently, high-content screening is the primary method for mapping functional gene networks in animal cells. In a high-content screen, light microscopy is used to assess phenotypes arising from gene inhibition by RNA-mediated interference, and the phenotype is captured by scoring a large parameter set (Conrad and Gerlich, 2010). The depth of the phenotypic proﬁle is based on the biological complexity of the assay and the nature and accuracy of parameter scoring. To date, the requirement for high-resolution imaging has generally limited high-content screening to single cells or early embryos. C. elegans is a prototype metazoan system for the functional mapping of essential genes (Piano et al., 2006). C. elegans has 20,000 genes, of which 2,500 are essential for embryo production or viability (WormBase release WS210; Harris et al., 2010). In a set of pioneering high-content screens, time-lapse Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy was used to ﬁlm the early divisions of embryos following individual inhibitions of speciﬁc subsets of ¨ C. elegans genes (Gonczy et al., 2000; Piano et al., 2000; Zipperlen et al., 2001). This was extended to a full-genome screen that generated high-content phenotypic proﬁles for ¨ 500 essential genes (Sonnichsen et al., 2005). These proﬁles were combined with protein-protein interaction and expression proﬁling data to create a ﬁrst-generation integrative map that linked 305 essential C. elegans genes in a ‘‘multiple support’’ network that grouped genes into modules involved in speciﬁc processes including spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, nuclear envelope dynamics, cortical dynamics, and centrosome function (Gunsalus et al., 2005). Despite the success of these studies, a large collection of essential genes could not be proﬁled because their inhibition results in sterility of the treated worm. Thus, the 554 genes in the ‘‘sterile’’ collection, which control fundamental cellular processes such as membrane trafﬁcking, translation, proteasome function, and cortical remodeling, were largely absent from this analysis. To ﬁll this gap in the analysis of the C. elegans essential gene set, we proﬁled the 554 sterile genes by imaging syncytial gonad architecture at high-resolution following gene knockdown and scoring 94 phenotypic parameters. To generate a reference for evaluating computational methods for network construction, genes were manually partitioned into 102 phenotypic classes, predicting functions for 106 of the 116 uncharacterized genes in the collection. Using the manual classiﬁcation as a benchmark, we developed a robust computational method for constructing gene networks from high-content proﬁles based on a network context-dependent measure that ranks the signiﬁcance of functional links between genes. This method allowed us to integrate our data with that from the prior high-content embryo-ﬁlming dataset to generate a network representation of 818 essential C. elegans genes that can be viewed at multiple levels of functional resolution.

RESULTS Phenotypic Proﬁling Based on The Morphology of a Complex Tissue: The C. elegans Gonad Around 900 C. elegans genes are required for embryo production ¨ and/or for the early embryonic cell divisions (Sonnichsen et al., 2005); this collection includes the majority of genes essential for basic processes common to all cells. Because their inhibition leads to sterility, 554 of these genes could not be proﬁled by embryo ﬁlming. Of the 554 sterile genes, 166 were unnamed, indicating no prior characterization (Figure 1A). For each unnamed gene, we determined whether the predicted product is a member of a KOG (eukaryotic orthologous group; Tatusov et al., 2003) and used the Ensembl database to determine if it has orthologs across species. Of the 166 unnamed genes, 50 had characterized orthologs that predicted a function for the C. elegans protein (Unnamed-Group I in Table S2). The remaining 116 were either members of KOGs of unknown function, had no predicted orthologs, or had multiple C. elegans paralogs (Unnamed-Group II in Table S2); we refer to these 116 genes as ‘‘uncharacterized’’ (Figure 1A). To proﬁle the 554 sterile genes, we developed a high-content assay based on 3D two-color ﬂuorescence confocal imaging of the gonad, a complex tissue in the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite (Figure 1B). The syncytial gonad contains 1000 meiotic nuclei in cup-shaped compartments open to a common cytoplasmic core. Compartments mature into oocytes as they progress from the distal tip to the proximal region of the gonad adjacent to the spermatheca. Gonad maturation and maintenance involves a broad spectrum of basic cellular processes (Figure 1C), making this tissue an attractive substrate for highcontent proﬁling. Gonad architecture was analyzed in a strain co-expressing ﬂuorescent markers that target to the plasma membrane (GFP fusion that binds PI4,5P2) and chromosomes (mCherry-histone H2B). Hermaphrodites were soaked in dsRNA against a target gene for 24 hr beginning at the late L4 larval stage, when the gonad has almost achieved its full complement of nuclei (Kimble and Crittenden, 2005). After 48 hr recovery, gonad architecture was assessed in triplicate by anesthetizing worms and imaging one gonad per worm. Binary phenotypic proﬁles were generated by scoring the set of 3 image stacks per target gene for 94 possible defects. The movie set for each gene was inspected for each of the 94 defects (Figure 1D; for a complete list with examples see Table S1), assigning a ‘‘0’’ when the defect was absent and a ‘‘1’’ when the defect was present in at least 2 of the 3 movies. All image stacks were analyzed by the same pair of individuals, who viewed and scored them together; image stacks were indexed by RNA number, making their analysis blind to gene identity. In the 24 cases where the three movies were not consistent, the experiment was repeated (see Figure S1 available online, Extended Experimental Procedures, and Table S6 for details on screen design and scoring methods).

Prior to using the manually deﬁned classes as a benchmark to optimize computational methods for network Rho GEF CDC25 Phosphatase T-Complex Chaperonin analysis, we validated the functional predictions arising from our classiﬁcation ect-2(RNAi) cdc-25.1(RNAi) cct-8(RNAi) by following up on 8 uncharacterized Cytokinesis/Rho Signaling Chaperonin Function Cell Cycle genes in 5 classes. The ﬁrst class (E2) predicted a role for T09E8.1 in the microtubule cytoskeleton at a resolution similar to what could be achieved through blinded (Figure 2A). Unlike other class E2 genes, partial T09E8.1 inhibition manual classiﬁcation by an experienced investigator. To develop did not lead to defects in the early embryonic cell divisions (not a better computational method, we began by manually partition- shown). In dividing cells, the microtubule cytoskeleton is orgaing the genes into classes to generate a reference that we could nized by centrosomes, whereas the gonad is dominated by use to evaluate computational methods for network construc- non-centrosomal microtubule arrays (Zhou et al., 2009). Thus, tion. Manual partitioning placed the 554 sterile genes into 102 we hypothesized that T09E8.1 is speciﬁcally required for nonphenotypic classes (Table S2 contains a description, sample centrosomal microtubule array formation. Hypodermal cells, image, and gene list for each class). For organizational purposes, born late in embryogenesis, also have non-centrosomal microtuthe 102 classes were grouped into 29 broad categories (labeled bule arrays that function in nuclear positioning (Fridolfsson and A-Z, AA, AB, and AC) that each contain classes sharing one or Starr, 2010). Partial T09E8.1 inhibition in the hypodermis led to more prominent defects. Movies and class designations can defects in nuclear positioning (Figure 2B), as well as a 3-fold be accessed via the Phenobank website (http://worm.mpi-cbg. reduction in the number and an increase in the length of the GFP-EBP-1 ‘‘comets’’ that mark growing microtubule ends (Figde/phenobank_gonad). The manually deﬁned phenotypic classes contained character- ure 2C). We conclude that T09E8.1, which we name noca-1 (for ized genes with common annotated molecular functions (Fig- non-centrosomal array), plays an important role in the organizaure 1E), indicating that similar gonad architecture phenotypes tion of the noncentrosomal microtubule arrays in the gonad and reﬂect similar molecular functions. Manual partitioning placed hypodermis. The second class (G1) predicted a role for F54D12.5 and DAF106 of the 116 uncharacterized genes into phenotypic classes containing characterized genes, leading to predictions for their 21, an hsp90-family chaperone, in the MAPK signaling pathway

F54D12.5

(Figure 2D). We tested these predictions using a genetic approach. Worms homozygous for the reduction-of-function allele mpk-1(ga111) exhibit normal gonad morphology, even though phosphorylated MPK-1 levels, a readout for pathway activity, are reduced compared to controls (Figures 2E and 2F; Lee et al., 2007). Partial knockdown of daf-21 or F54D12.5, under conditions that did not result in a morphological phenotype in control worms, led to a strong MAPK knockdown phenotype in the mpk-1(ga111) background (Figures 2E and 2F; Figure S2, Table S3). RNAi of daf-21 reduced phosphorylated MPK-1 levels in control and let-60 gain-of-function worms (Figures 2E and 2F; Table S3), indicating that DAF-21 acts at the level of or downstream of LET-60/Ras in the MAPK pathway (Figure 2G). F54D12.5 RNAi did not reduce phosphorylated MPK-1 levels, and F54D12.5 contains 2 potential MPK-1 docking sites suggesting that it is an MPK-1 substrate (Figure 2G). We conclude that DAF-21 and F54D12.5 function at different points in the MAPK signaling pathway and name F54D12.5, eom-1, for enhancer of mpk-1(ga111). The third class (S2) predicted roles for three uncharacterized proteins in the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C; Figure 3A). Immuno-afﬁnity puriﬁcation of one uncharacterized gene product, K10D2.4, from C. elegans extracts followed by mass spectrometry recovered seven APC components (Figure 3B). The product of another uncharacterized Class S2 gene, C09H10.7, was also recovered—indicating that both K10D2.4 and C09H10.7 are APC/C subunits. K10D2.4 was recently identiﬁed as a metazoan-speciﬁc component of the APC/C (Hubner et al., 2010; Hutchins et al., 2010; Kops et al., 2010) and the gene was named emb-1/apc-16. We name C09H10.7, apc-17. The fourth class (F2) predicted a role for the BTB-domain containing protein C08C3.4 in cortical remodeling/cytokinesis (Figure 3C). A GFP fusion with C08C3.4 localized to the contractile ring at the tip of the cleavage furrow in dividing embryos (Figure 3D), and embryos partially depleted of C08C3.4 exhibited cytokinesis defects (Figure 3E). We conclude that C08C3.4 is required for cortical remodeling in the gonad and cytokinesis in embryos and name the gene cyk-7. The ﬁfth class (I2) phenotype included debris labeled with the plasma membrane probe, suggesting a role in membrane trafﬁcking (Figure 3F). We tested for a trafﬁcking function by imaging compartment boundaries in a strain co-expressing a mCherry labeled plasma membrane probe and a GFP fusion with SNB1, a SNARE trafﬁcked through the endomembrane system and delivered to the plasma membrane (Figure 3G). Compartment boundaries in control worms have SNB-1-GFP and the plasma membrane probe and are yellow. Trafﬁcking defects prevent SNB-1-GFP from reaching the plasma membrane, leading to red compartment boundaries. 8 of the 15 Class I2 genes, including F27C8.6 and T01B7.6, exhibited defects in the SNB1 assay (Figure 3G). We name F27C8.6 and T01B7.6 trcs-1 and trcs-2, respectively, for (transport to the cell surface). The follow up work on these ﬁve classes demonstrates that gonad architecture has sufﬁcient resolution to functionally classify genes across a broad spectrum of essential cellular functions. It also validates the manual classiﬁcation, establishing it as a benchmark for evaluating computational methods for network construction.

Development of a Network Context-Dependent Method to Evaluate the Signiﬁcance of Functional Links Between Genes Based on High-Content Phenotypic Proﬁles Our initial efforts using automated clustering were unable to partition genes at a resolution comparable to what could be achieved by an experienced investigator. To circumvent this limitation, we used the manually-deﬁned classes as a tool to develop a robust computational method for constructing gene networks based on high-content parameter proﬁles. We ﬁrst compared the phenotypic proﬁles by calculating the Pearson’s Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC) for each pair of genes. The resulting network was visualized using N-Browse, an interactive Javabased tool (Kao and Gunsalus, 2008), to display connections between genes whose proﬁles were correlated with a PCC greater than or equal to a speciﬁed threshold (Figures 4A and 4B; dark blue lines connecting gray gene nodes). To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we circled gene clusters that corresponded to our manually-deﬁned classes. This approach revealed that the optimal PCC threshold for viewing functionally relevant connections (red outlined boxes in Figure 4B) varied substantially between different network neighborhoods. This variability was due to the varying nature of the proﬁled phenotypes and the extent to which they are captured by the parameter set, the extent to which scored parameters are related versus independent, and the fact that proﬁles with more features often exhibit more variance. Viewing the entire network at a single PCC threshold is not possible because for some regions the threshold is too low and the view is cluttered with non-speciﬁc connections (Figure 4B, images above the red boxed images), and for other regions the threshold is too high, yielding an empty network in which many meaningful connections are absent (Figure 4B, images below the red boxed images). To circumvent the limitations of PCC-based analysis, we developed a measure that ranks the signiﬁcance of functional links between genes based on network context. For each pair of genes A and B, we assigned a Connection Speciﬁcity Index (CSI) by: (1) calculating the PCC for the connections between A and B and each of the other genes in the dataset, (2) counting the number of genes connected to A or B with PCC R PCCAB 0.05 (i.e., at a level comparable to or better than the correlation between A and B, correlations with a PCC up to 0.05 less than PCCAB were considered similar—this offset was determined empirically); (3) dividing this number by the total number of genes in the screen (554); and (4) subtracting the result from 1.0 (Figure 4C). The CSI is equivalent to the fraction of genes in the dataset whose proﬁles are less similar to those of A and B than the proﬁle of A is to the proﬁle of B. For example, a CSI of 0.97 means that the similarity between A and B is highly speciﬁc: only 3% of gene knockdowns have proﬁles with comparable or higher similarity to either A or B. Since the CSI scales uniformly with functional signiﬁcance across the entire network, connections of a similar level of signiﬁcance can simultaneously be displayed at a single CSI threshold (Figure 4D). We evaluated the performance of CSI and PCC threshold networks by comparing the ability of an automated clustering algorithm (MINE, Module Identiﬁcation in NEtworks;

(A) Flowchart of the steps used to construct the gene networks in (B). (B) Gene networks were constructed by displaying connections (dark blue lines) between genes whose knockdown proﬁles were correlated with a PCC R three speciﬁed thresholds (0.46, top; 0.60, middle; 0.70, bottom). Each column shows a network region, labeled based on the primary function of the genes in that region. To compare the computational network to the manually-deﬁned phenotypic classes, gene groups from manually-assigned classes were circled and labeled. The optimal PCC threshold at which signiﬁcant connections were displayed and non-speciﬁc connections were ﬁltered out (red boxes) was different for different network regions.

Rhrissorrakrai and Gunsalus, in press) to identify gene clusters corresponding to our manually-deﬁned classes. This analysis revealed that over the useful range of the two parameters, networks generated using CSI thresholds have 3-fold fewer connections than comparable PCC networks; this noise reduction translates into a substantial improvement in the ability of an automated algorithm to identify functionally relevant gene clusters (Figures 4E and 4F; Figure S3). Approximately half of the manually-deﬁned classes containing 4 or more genes could be identiﬁed by automated clustering in a network constructed using the single CSI threshold of 0.96, whereas only 14% could be identiﬁed in a comparable PCC network (Figure 4F). When MINE was allowed to search networks spanning a range of CSI thresholds (0.90 to 0.99), clusters corresponding to 90% of the manually-deﬁned classes could be identiﬁed, compared to 65% for networks spanning a range of PCC thresholds (0.5-1). Heat map dendograms also revealed more sharply deﬁned clusters when using the CSI, indicating that the CSI increases network clarity (Figure 4G; Table S4). We conclude that constructing networks using CSI thresholds circumvents the variability in the signiﬁcance of a strict correlation measure in different network regions that arises due to the complexity of high-content screening parameters. Using the CSI instead of the PCC reduces connection noise and allows connections of a similar functional signiﬁcance to be viewed across the entire network at a single threshold. Varying the CSI Threshold Reveals Functional Modularity in the Gene Network at Different Levels of Resolution The CSI-based network representation allows exploration of functional modularity at different levels of resolution. This point is illustrated by the region of the gene network involved in protein production (Figure 5A): a relatively low threshold CSI of 0.90 connects the entire set of genes involved in protein translation, mRNA splicing, and protein folding in a dense meshwork. An intermediate CSI threshold of 0.93 results in a sparser network of more speciﬁc connections that deﬁnes smaller gene groups. At a high CSI threshold of 0.97, the chaperonins, tRNA synthetases, translation initiation/elongation factors, small ribosome subunits, large ribosome subunits, and splicing factors are resolved into separate clusters. Thus, dialing the CSI up or down reveals functional relationships at different levels of resolution. The automated clusters identiﬁed by MINE at three different CSI thresholds are provided in the supplement (Table S5; note that genes can be in multiple clusters). We assessed the resolution limit of the gonad architecture assay using the region of the network representing genes involved in protein degradation (Figure 5B, Figure S4). Above the very high CSI threshold of 0.99, the connections that remained linked genes within speciﬁc proteasome subcomplexes (the Lid, the core b-ring, the core a-ring or the 19S ATPase base; Figure 5B). We conclude that phenotypic proﬁling based on complex tissue architecture, coupled with automated construction of CSI-based networks from parameter proﬁles, is capable of correctly assigning very ﬁne distinctions in protein function.

CSI-Enabled Integration of High-Content Data Sets Generates a Global View of the C. elegans Essential Gene Network Together, the gonad architecture (554 genes) and time-lapse embryo ﬁlming (661 genes) screens provide high-content proﬁles for 885 essential genes (330 were proﬁled in both screens). The CSI is ideally suited for integrating these datasets because it ﬁlters out low speciﬁcity phenotypic links, leading to a network that combines only the signiﬁcant relationships identiﬁed by the two screens. We binarized the phenotypic signatures in the embryo timelapse screen, which were based on scoring for 45 possible ¨ defects (Sonnichsen et al., 2005), calculated a CSI for each gene pair, and simultaneously displayed both data sets in N-Browse to create an integrated network. The merged network, or network regions centered on genes of interest, can be viewed at any CSI threshold in N-Browse (instructions and a demo video describing how to use N-Browse can be accessed at http://worm.mpi-cbg. de/phenobank_gonad/nbrowse). At a CSI threshold of 0.96, the integrated network has 3382 high signiﬁcance connections linking 818 genes (Figures 6A–6C). The combined view provides functional information for 90% of the genes required for embryo production or the ﬁrst two embryonic divisions. Despite the presence of 330 genes in common, the relationships identiﬁed by the two datasets were highly orthogonal—only 23 of the total 3382 phenotypic links are shared (Figure 6A). This lack of overlap is explained by the majority of the 330 common genes failing to make high-signiﬁcance connections in the embryo time-lapse screen due to sterility onset (Figure S5). Overall, the CSI-based network integrates information acquired in the biologically distinct contexts of the gonad and embryo to provide a multi-layered view of the function of 818 genes required for essential cellular processes in a multicellular organism. DISCUSSION High-content screening is the primary method for mapping functional gene networks in animal cells (Collins et al., 2009; Conrad and Gerlich, 2010; Gunsalus, 2008). A number of high-content screens have classiﬁed genes based on cell morphology following gene knockdown (examples include Bakal et al., 2007; Echard et al., 2004; Eggert et al., 2004; Goshima et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2009; Neumann et al., 2010; Piano et al., 2002; ¨ Sonnichsen et al., 2005). While successful in identifying genes that contribute to cell division and morphology, the ability of these screens to assess protein function across a breadth of cellular processes falls far short of what has been attained using genetic interaction proﬁling in fungi. Screen resolution—the ability to discriminate between different biological functions—depends on the information content of the phenotypic assay; therefore, one approach to enhance resolution has been time-lapse imaging (Conrad and Gerlich, 2010). Here, we explored an alternative approach—analyzing the effects of gene knockdowns on complex tissue architecture at a single time point in a multicellular organism. We monitored C. elegans gonad architecture following gene knockdown by scoring 94 phenotypic features. Our results demonstrate that the biological complexity of the gonad translates into phenotypes that enable proﬁling across a wide spectrum of essential cellular processes at a resolution approaching that of genetic interaction proﬁling in yeasts.

The Sterile Gene Collection: A Prominent Gap in the Functional Genomic Analysis of the C. elegans Essential Gene Set Sequencing of the C. elegans genome and the discovery of RNAi catalyzed efforts to systematically catalog the functions of its predicted genes (Piano et al., 2006).

However, sterility onset following RNAi was a major complication that precluded in-depth characterization of a large number of genes. Our efforts focused on these 554 sterile genes, which we proﬁled by imaging gonad architecture following RNAi knockdowns and generating a parameterized description of the resulting phenotypes.

The presence of proteasome components in our dataset offered an opportunity to compare the resolution of our approach to genetic interaction proﬁling in yeast. The proteasome is a 2.5MDa macro-molecular machine that contains over 30 different subunits organized into a 20S core complex, composed of a and b rings, and a 19S regulatory particle, containing base and lid sub-complexes (Bochtler et al., 1999). In yeast, distinct genetic interaction proﬁles were obtained for the subunits of the four proteasome sub-complexes using a sensitive competitive growth assay (Breslow et al., 2008). At a CSI R 0.99 (a high-stringency ﬁlter), the connections that remained were between subunits of speciﬁc proteasome subcomplexes (a ring, b ring, lid and base; Figure 5B). This observation indicates phenotypic proﬁles based on gonad morphology provide resolution sufﬁcient to group subunits of speciﬁc proteasome subcomplexes. At the core of our dataset are proﬁles composed of parameters visually scored by experienced investigators rather than acquired through automated image analysis. Given the complexity of the substrate—a 3 dimensional tissue in a living organism that can be variably positioned in the worm—and the large spectrum of knockdown phenotypes that can entirely change the properties of the structure (gonad size, shape, position, compartment and nuclei number and morphology) automated parameter scoring would have been exceedingly difﬁcult. However, the exact properties that make automated analysis difﬁcult—the varied and dramatic effects that gene knockdowns can have on gonad architecture—are also the properties that give the assay its proﬁling power. Although manual parameter scoring could introduce some bias, this was minimized by performing the analysis blinded to gene identity and the by fact that the individual parameters were scored by investigators who were largely oblivious to the larger patterns that would ultimately emerge. A Robust Computational Method for Constructing Gene Networks From High-Content Screening Data By evaluating computational methods for network construction using a validated manual classiﬁcation of a rich phenotypic dataset, we were able to devise a robust computational method for constructing gene networks from high-content phenotypic proﬁles. This method overcomes two challenges encountered in network analysis of high-content datasets. The ﬁrst challenge is that the level of proﬁle correlation that is signiﬁcant varies in different network regions due to the varying nature of the proﬁled phenotypes and the extent to which they are captured by the parameter set. The second challenge is that commonly encountered (and thus less informative) phenotypes can generate a ‘‘hairball’’ of connections that obscures meaningful functional links. At the center of the method we developed to overcome these challenges is a simple metric—the CSI, which is a network contextdependent measure that ranks the signiﬁcance of functional links between genes. Compared to the Pearson’s Correlation Coefﬁcient, constructing networks based on the CSI reduces nonspeciﬁc connection noise, improves network clarity, and allows connections of a similar functional signiﬁcance to be simultaneously viewed across the entire network at a single threshold. Ranking connection signiﬁcance allows exploration of the gene network at different levels of functional resolution and integration of high-content screening data from different sources.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the CSI by using it to integrate the high-content data from our gonad architecture screen with that from the prior embryo-ﬁlming screen, to generate an integrated network that provides a multi-layered view of 818 genes in the C. elegans essential gene set. The phenotypic proﬁles in these datasets are composed of parameters that were visually scored rather than measured through automated image analysis. However, constructing networks based on phenotypic proﬁles faces the same challenges, regardless of whether parameters are scored through manual or automated means. Consequently, we anticipate that the CSI-based method described here will be of equal utility in analyzing and integrating datasets composed of parameters acquired through automated analysis.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES C. elegans Strains Strains are listed in Table S7. The strains OD95, UD299, DP38, OD70, MSN142, NL2098, and BS3623 were previously described (Arur et al., 2009; Essex et al., 2009, Fridolfsson and Star, 2010; Kachur et al., 2008; Maduro and Pilgrim, 1995; Shi et al., 2010; Sijen et al., 2001). OD447 was generated by using a PDS-1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad Laboratories; Praitis et al., 2001) to bombard a construct containing the C08C3.4 genomic locus cloned into the SpeI site of pIC26 (Cheeseman et al., 2004) into DP38. OD449 was generated by mating OD447 with OD70. RNA Production Templates for dsRNA production were generated by using primers with tails containing the T3 and T7 promoters to amplify to amplify a 500-1000 bp region of the corresponding gene from genomic DNA. When possible, the oligo pairs ¨ used by Sonnichsen et al. (2005) were chosen. New oligos were designed for ¨ ¨ genes not in the Sonnichsen screen and when the Sonnichsen oligo pairs ampliﬁed introns or regions smaller or larger than 500-1000 bp (oligos are listed in Table S2). PCR reactions were cleaned (PerfectPrep 96 kit; Eppendorf) and used as templates for T3 and T7 transcription reactions (Megascript T3 and T7 kits, Ambion). Transcription reactions were mixed, cleaned (MegaClear96 kit, Ambion), and annealed by adding 3x Soaking buffer (32.7 mM Na2HPO4, 16.5 mM KH2PO4, 6.3 mM NaCl, 14.1 mM NH4Cl) to a ﬁnal concentration of 1X and incubating the reactions at 68 C for 10 min followed by 37 C for 30 min. RNA Interference Larval (L4 stage) worms from the strain OD95 were rinsed with M9 and soaked in 5 ml of dsRNA (supplemented with 0.5 ml of a 50/50 mixture of 63 mM spermidine and 1.1% gelatin) for 24 hr at 20 C inside a humid chamber. Worms were transferred to NGM plates seeded with OP50 E. coli and allowed to recover at 20 C for 48 hr prior to imaging. Live Imaging Six worms were anesthetized in a fresh mixture of 1 mg/ml Tricane (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt) and 0.1 mg/ml of tetramisole hydrochloride (TMHC) dissolved in M9 for 15-30 min before transferring them to an agarose pad under a coverslip for imaging. Gonads were imaged by collecting an 80 3 0.5 mm z-series including DIC, GFP and RFP images for every z-plane. Microscopy was performed with a spinning disk confocal mounted on a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope equipped with a 60x 1.4 NA PlanApochromat lens, a krypton-argon 2.5 W water-cooled laser (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) and a Hamamatsu Orca ER CCD camera. Acquisition parameters, shutters, and focus were controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Sterility Assessment At the time when the other worms in the cohort were anesthetized and imaged, 3 worms were moved to a fresh plate. After 24 hr at 20 C, the number of

embryos and L1 progeny on the plate was counted. A gene was ‘‘sterile’’ if no embryos or L1 larvae were observed, ‘‘partially sterile’’ if < 50 embryos/L1 worms were present, and ‘‘wild-type’’ if > 50 embryos/L1 worms were present. After an additional 24 hr, we assessed whether the knockdown resulted in embryonic lethality. If > 50 L1-L2 larvae were present, they were considered ‘‘viable,’’ if < 50 L1-L2 larvae were present and there were > 5 dead embryos, it was considered ‘‘embryonic lethal.’’ Antibody Production Antibodies against K10D2.4 were generated by using the oligos cgcgcgggatccgctttgatgtacccattcca and gcgcgcgaattctcaaggatttgcaggcatattt to amplify a region encoding amino acids 2-81 from a cDNA library. The product was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and cloned into pGEX6P-1 digested with the same enzymes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The puriﬁed GST fusion protein was outsourced for injection into rabbits (Covance). Antibodies were afﬁnity puriﬁed by binding to columns of the same antigen after removal of the GST tag as described previously (Desai et al., 2003). Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry K10D2.4 was immunoprecipiated from extracts prepared from frozen worm pellets (Desai et al., 2003) and mass spectrometry was performed (Cheeseman et al., 2004) as described, using the most recent version of the predicted C. elegans proteins (Wormprep111). Hypodermal Cell Experiments, MAP Kinase Experiments, and Membrane Trafﬁcking Assay For Figure 2C, embryos produced by adult hermaphrodites from the strain UD299 were imaged as described (Fridolfson and Starr, 2010), 20 hr after injection of dsRNA against T09E8.1 into their gonad. Nuclear migration was scored in L1 larvae using DIC optics as described (Starr et al., 2001). The attenuated RNAi, gonad dissection, immunoﬂuorescence, and gonad analysis in Figure 2E and F (Arur et al., 2009) and the GFP-SNB-1 trafﬁcking assay (Shi et al., 2010) were performed as described.
