Summary
The swelling of secretory vesicles has been implicated in exocytosis, but the underlying mechanism of vesicle swelling remained unknown. Earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrated the association of the α-subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gαi3 with zymogen granule membrane and implicated its involvement in vesicle swelling. Mas7, an active mastoparan analog known to stimulate Gi proteins, was found to stimulate the GTPase activity of isolated zymogen granules and cause swelling. Increase in vesicle size in the presence of GTP, NaF, and Mas7 were irreversible and found to be KCl sensitive. However, Ca2+ had no effect on zymogen granule size. Taken together, these results indicated that zymogen granules, the membrane-bound secretory vesicles in exocrine pancreas, swell in response to GTP mediated by a Gαi3 protein. Subsequently, our studies demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is also present at the zymogen granule membrane and participates in rapid GTP-induced and Gαi3-mediated vesicular water gating and swelling. Isolated zymogen granules exhibit low basal water permeability. However, exposure of granules to GTP results in a marked potentiation of water entry. Treatment of zymogen granules with the known water channel inhibitor Hg2+ is accompanied by a reversible loss in both the basal and GTP-stimulable water entry and vesicle swelling. Introduction of AQP1-specific antibody raised against the carboxy-terminal domain of AQP1 blocked GTP-stimulable swelling of vesicles. Our results demonstrate that AQP1 associated at the zymogen granule membrane is involved in basal GTP-induced and Gαi3-mediated rapid gating of water into zymogen granules of the exocrine pancreas. Key Words: Secretory vesicle; AFM; swelling.

1. Introduction Secretory vesicle swelling is critical for exocytosis (1–4); however, the underlying mechanism of vesicle swelling remains unknown. In mast cells, increase in secretory vesicle volume following stimulation of secretion had been suggested from electrophysiological measurements (5).

had also been demonstrated (4,6,7). Isolated zymogen granules (ZGs), the membrane-bound secretory vesicles in exocrine pancreas and parotid glands, posses Cl– and ATP-sensitive K+ selective ion channels at the vesicle membrane, whose activities are implicated in vesicle swelling (8–16). Additionally, secretion of ZG contents in permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells requires the presence of both K+ and Cl– ions (2). In vitro ZG–pancreatic plasma membrane fusion assays demonstrate potentiation of fusion in the presence of GTP and NaF (2,17, unpublished observation). Heterotrimeric Gαi3 protein has been implicated in the regulation of both K+ and Cl– ion channels in a number of tissues (18–22). Analogous to the regulation of K+ and Cl– ion channels at the cell membrane, the regulation of K+ and Cl– ion channels at the ZG membrane by a Gαi protein was demonstrated (17). Isolated ZGs from exocrine pancreas swell rapidly in response to GTP and NaF (17). These studies suggest the involvement of rapid water entry into ZGs following exposure to GTP. As opposed to osmotic swelling, membrane-associated water channels called aquaporins have been implicated in rapid volume changes in cells (23,24) and intracellular vesicles (25,26). Therefore, the likely mechanism of ZG swelling via possible water channels at the ZG membrane was explored (27). Our study demonstrates the presence of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in ZG membranes and its participation in Gαi3mediated and GTP-induced vesicle water entry and swelling (27). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Fractions Rat pancreatic fractions were prepared and their purity determined as described elsewhere (28–30). Salt and detergent treatment of isolated ZG membrane preparations were performed at 4°C for 30 min. Following treatment, supernatant and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation of the reaction mixture at 4°C for 1 h at 200,000g. 2.2. Immunoblot Analysis Immunoblot analysis was performed on pancreatic fractions prepared as described in ref. 26. Protein in pancreatic fractions was estimated by the Bradford method (31). Pancreatic fractions were boiled in Laemmli reducing sample preparation buffer (32) for 5 min. Equal loads of protein were resolved by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), followed by electrotransfer to 0.2-μM nitrocellulose sheets. The nitrocellulose was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3) and immunoblotted for 2 h at room temperature with either affinity-purified B-CHIP (AQP1) antibody raised against the holoprotein (32) (a gift from B. Baum and M.A. Knepper) or monoclonal vesicle-associated

membrane protein (VAMP) antibody recognizing VAMP1 and VAMP2 from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. Both primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer. The immunoblotted nitrocellulose sheets were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3 prior to incubation for 1 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer. The immunoblots were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3, processed for enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to X-OMATAR film. The exposed films were then developed and photographed. 2.3. Immunoelectron Microscopy Sections were prepared from rat pancreatic lobules embedded in unicryl and double immunogold labeling performed (33) using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Gαi3 and an antibody raised to the carboxy terminal of AQP1. Sequential labeling and visualization involved blocking steps and the use of 10 nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit and 5 nm gold-conjugated goat antibody. 2.4. Atomic Force Microscopy Isolated ZG suspensions in 125 μM KCl–Mes buffer, pH 6.5, were plated on Cell-Tak-coated glass cover slips. Ten minutes after plating, the cover slips were placed in a fluid chamber and washed with the KCl–Mes buffer to remove unattached granules, prior to imaging the attached ZG in KCl–Mes buffer or water, in the presence or absence of various concentrations of GTP, 25 μM HgCl2, and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol. AQP1 antibody raised against the carboxy-terminus domain of AQP1 (Santa Cruz) was introduced into the ZG lumen by incubating the ZG at 4°C for 5 min in KCl–Mes buffer containing streptolysin-O (SLO) and the antibody or vehicle, followed by a 2-min incubation at 30°C and three washes in ice-cold 125 mM KCl–Mes buffer, pH 6.5. At 4°C, the SLO binds to the cholesterol molecule at the ZG membrane, making approx 14-nm holes at 30°C, which allow antibodies (approx 8 nm) to enter the ZG. Washing ZG with ice-cold 125 mM KCl–Mes buffer reseals the holes and removes ZG-associated SLO. Following incubation, the ZGs containing AQP1 antibody or the vehicle were washed and imaged in the presence of 40 μM GTP. ZG imaging and dynamics were performed using the Nanoscope IIIa, an AFM from Digital Instruments (Santa Barbera, CA). ZGs were imaged both in the “contact” and “tapping” mode in fluid (34,35). However, all images presented in this manuscript were obtained in the “tapping” mode in fluid, using silicon nitride tips with a spring constant of 0.06 N/m and an imaging force of less than 200 nN. Images were obtained at line frequencies of 2 Hz, with 512 lines per image, and constant image gains. Time-dependent (resolution in seconds) morphological changes in ZG were obtained using section analysis. Topographical

dimensions of ZG were analyzed using the software nanoscopeIIIa 4.43r8 supplied by Digital Instruments. 2.5. Measurement of Tritiated Water Entry Isolated ZGs in 100 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 50,000 cpm of tritiated water were exposed to different stimulators, inhibitors, or their respective controls. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min; ZGs were collected by centrifugation and tritiated water incorporation into them was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Purity and Size Heterogeneity of ZGs The purity of ZGs was determined by imaging the isolated ZGs using a TEM (Fig. 1A). Figure 1A is an electron micrograph of the purified electron-dense ZGs with no detectable subcellular contaminants. When isolated ZGs plated on CellTak-coated mica sheets were placed in 125 mM Mes buffer (pH 6.5) and imaged by the AFM, three-dimensional images were obtained (see Fig. 1B) that demonstrated a size heterogeneity in the ZG population. Measurements of ZG images obtained by AFM demonstrated that the diameter of ZGs range from 0.2 to 1.2 μM. 3.2.

Identification of Gαi3-immunoreactive antigen associated with ZGM. (A) Ten micrograms each of TH and ZGM was resolved using a single-dimension 12.5% SDS gel electrophoresis before electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotting. A 44-kDa immunoreactive band was detected in both fractions but enriched in the ZGM. (B) Twenty-five micrograms of ZGM protein was resolved on two-dimensional 16-BAC gel electrophoresis before electrotransfer and immunoblotting using the Gi3-specific antibody. Note a single spot at approx 44 kDa, suggesting that only one Gi3 isoform is present in the ZGM. (From ref. 17.)

SDS/PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane demonstrated a 44-kDa major immunoreactive band in both fractions. An increase in band intensity was found in the ZGM fraction over TH (see Fig. 2A). An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acid 345–354 mapping at the carboxy terminus of Gi3 of rat origin was used in the study. No immunoreactive bands were detected in the ZGM fraction when the nitrocellulose with resolved proteins was immunoblotted with affinity-purified Gs-, Gz-, and Gt-specific antibodies (not shown). To determine if more than one Gi isoform was present in ZGM, twodimensional 16-BAC gel followed by immunoblotting using the Gi3- specific antibody was performed. Results from this study demonstrate a single spot at approximately the 44-kDa mark to be present in ZGM (see Fig. 2B). The 44-kDa immunoreactive band (single-dimension protein resolution) or spot (twodimensional protein resolution) was absent in blots that were immunostained with peptide-neutralized antibody (not shown).

Fig. 3. Twenty micrograms of protein from each of the rat pancreatic fractions, total homogenate (T), zymogen granule (Z), 200,000g particulate (P) and supernatant (S) from total homogenates, and zymogen granule membrane (M), were resolved using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins in each fraction were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted using AQP1 and VAMP-specific antibodies. The 28-kDa AQP1 immunoreactivity is associated with the M fraction (A). The purity of isolated Z is demonstrated by the enriched presence of VAMP in the M fraction (B). Zymogen granules are membrane-bound secretory vesicles packed with secretory proteins. The membrane fraction constitutes <1% of total granular proteins. Thus, very little AQP1 and VAMP immunoreactivity is detected in total granules, compared with several-fold enrichment in the granule membrane fraction. Affinity of AQP1 association with M was further examined by exposing 10 μg of granule membrane protein to buffer, salt, and detergent (C). After treatment of the granule membrane, the particulate and supernatant fractions were separated by centrifugation at 200,000g. Examination of particulate (C-P) and supernatant (C-S) fractions prepared following PBS treatment, treatment with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (T-P, T-S), or with 1 M KCl (N-P, N-S) demonstrates specific and tight association of AQP1 immunoreactivity with M. Exposure of the M to PBS or 1 M KCl failed to dislodge the AQP1 immunoreactivity; however, the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was able to dissociate AQP1 from the granule membrane. (From ref. 27.)

3.3. Water Channel AQP1 at ZG Membrane Pancreatic subcellular fractions (2,17,28,30) demonstrate the presence of AQP1 immunoreactivity in ZG membrane preparations (see Fig. 3A). A strong immunoreactive signal was also observed in the pancreatic particulate fraction. Because it is possible for ZG to have been contaminated with other subcellular components enriched in AQP1, it was necessary to determine the purity of the

Fig. 4. AQP1 immunofluorescent confocal microscopy on stimulated and resting pancreatic lobules (A–D). Pancreatic lobules incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the absence (resting) or presence (stimulated) of the secretagogue carbamylcholine (1 × 10–5 M). A fourfold increase in amylase secretion from stimulated pancreatic lobules over resting was observed (data not shown). Following incubation, the lobules were fixed, cryosectioned, and processed for immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Confocal images of AQP1 immunostained pancreatic tissue in resting (A,C) and stimulated (B,D) states indicate association of AQP1 with zymogen granules and its possible involvement in secretion. In resting acinar cells, AQP1 appears distributed throughout the cell including the apical region (arrow). The nucleus (n) located at the basolateral end of pancreatic acinar cells is devoid of AQP1-specific immunostaining. Following stimulation of secretion, much of the AQP1 immunoreactivity is localized at the apical region of pancreatic acinar cells where secretion is known to occur. (Bar = 10 μM.)

ZG preparation. The purity of ZG and the ZG membrane fractions were further determined by the enriched presence of VAMP immunoreactivity (see Fig. 3B). VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin, is a vesicle-associated membrane protein present in ZG membranes. A significant enrichment of VAMP immunoreactivity was observed in ZG membrane, compared to other pancreatic fractions. To determine the type of association of AQP1 with ZGs, the ZG membrane was treated with salt (1 M KCl) and a nonionic detergent (1% Triton X-100). Detergent treatment released the AQP1 immunoreactivity from ZG membranes, but salt had no effect (see Fig. 3C). These results show that AQP1, as its structure suggests (36,37), is tightly associated with the ZG membrane. To further determine the distribution of AQP1 in pancreatic acinar cells, AQP1 immunoreactivity was examined (38), using both light (see Fig. 4A–D) and electron microscopy (see Fig. 4E). Pancreatic acinar cells are polarized secretory cells which contain apically located ZGs. Abundant AQP1 immunoreactivity was

Three-dimensional AFM images and section analysis of ZG, untreated (A,B) or pretreated with 25 μM HgCl2 (C,D) and pretreated with 25 μM HgCl2 followed by 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol (E,F) before (A,C,E) and after (B,D,F) exposure to 40 μM GTP. Notice the increase in size of ZG (from A to B and I) in the three-dimensional array, section analysis, and bar graph, following exposure to GTP. Pretreatment of ZG with HgCl2 abolishes the GTP effect (from C to D and I). However, the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 is partially reversed in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (from E to F and I). Incubation of ZG in water instead of 125 mM KCl–Mes buffer, pH 6.5, has little effect on ZG size (time 0 min G to time 30 min H and I). (From ref. 27.)

detected at the apical region of these cells. In resting acini (see Fig. 4A–D), AQP1 immunoreactivity was detectable throughout the cell, but its primary localization was at the apical region. Electron microscopy further confirms the presence of AQP1 at the ZG membrane (see Fig. 4E). It is well established that following a secretory stimulus, there is release of granular contents at the

apical lumen of pancreatic acini. Immunocytochemistry performed using light microscopy demonstrated intense AQP1-specific labeling at the apical region of the cell (see Fig. 4B,D), suggesting the involvement of AQP1 in secretion. 3.4. GTP-Induced ZG Swelling Is HgCl2 Sensitive As previously demonstrated, exposure to GTP results in swelling (percent volume increase = 38.22 ± 5.87; mean ± S.E.) of isolated ZG preparations (see Figs. 5A,B,I and 6A–C). Within seconds, following exposure to 40 μM GTP, a marked increase in water entry into ZG was demonstrated (see Fig. 6A,B). Water permeability of ZG was GTP dose dependent, as assayed by using the entry of tritiated water (see Fig. 6C). The increased entry of tritiated water was 6.5% over control in the presence of 10 μM GTP, 29.6% in the presence of 20 μM GTP, and 58% in the presence of 40 μM GTP. However, exposure of ZG to HgCl2, a known inhibitor of AQP1 (18,39), results in inhibition of both the basal (75.1 ± 6.17% of control) as well as the GTP-mediated (80.43 ± 3.55% of control) water permeability (see Figs. 5C,D,I and 6D). The effect of HgCl2 on ZG was reversed in the presence of 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (see Fig. 5E,F,I), as

326

demonstrated by a 16.83 ± 3.53% GTP-induced increase in volume of HgCl2treated vesicles following exposure to 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. 3.5. Functional AQP1 at ZG Membrane To determine if the GTP-induced water entry was the result of the AQP1 water channel function or osmosis driven, isolated ZGs were incubated in water and their size was monitored. Isolated ZG incubated in water had little effect (see Fig. 5G,H,I), as shown by no significant change in percent ZG volume over control (7.32 ± 4.51%). The presence of functional AQP1 in ZG membranes was confirmed from tritiated water (3H2O) permeability experiments on isolated ZG. ZGs were incubated in buffer containing 3H2O, in the presence and absence of GTP and/or HgCl2. GTP is known to induce swelling of isolated ZGs (17). Exposure of isolated ZGs to GTP (10–40 μM) results in an increase in water entry in a dose-dependent manner (see Fig. 6C). In the presence of HgCl2, GTP-induced water entry was inhibited (see Fig. 6D). Isolated ZGs are stable for hours in low-pH (pH 6–6.5) buffers. At neutral or alkaline pH, isolated ZGs rapidly lyse. All studies were therefore performed in pH 6.5 buffer. These results, however, do not exclude the possibility that yet unidentified mercury-sensitive water channels might contribute to GTPstimulable water entry into ZGs. This issue was addressed by introducing, into ZGs, AQP1-specific antibody raised against the carboxyl domain of the water channel. 3.6. AQP1 Regulates ZG Swelling The introduction of AQP1-specific antibody into isolated ZG was carried out by permeabilizing ZG using SLO. We next carried out experiments to determine whether the AQP1 antibody actually entered the SLO-treated ZGs and, if so to determine their distribution within the ZG. Both Western blot assay and immuno-electron microscopy demonstrate the entry of AQP1 antibody into ZGs (see Fig. 7A–E; see Color Plate 19 following p. 274). When intact and permeabilized ZGs were separately exposed to the AQP1 antibody, resolved using SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellular membrane and immunoblot probed using a secondary antibody conjugated to a chemiluminescent marker, the AQP antibody was detected in the SLO-treated ZG, demonstrating entry of the antibody. No detectable signal was seen in the intact ZG fraction exposed to the AQP1 antibody (see Fig. 7A). Electron microscopy performed in the intact and SLO-treated ZG demonstrated intense immunogold localization in the SLO-treated ZGs, confirming AQP1 entry into the ZGs. Specific immunogold labeling at the luminal side of the ZG membrane in the SLO-treated batch further confirms binding of the antibody to the carboxy domain of AQP1. When AQP1specific antibody was introduced into SLO permeabilized ZGs (see Fig. 7A–F),

Lane 1 is AQP1 antibody alone; lane 2 is nonpermeable ZG exposed to antibody; lane 3 is permeable ZG exposed to AQP1 antibody. Immuno-electron micrographs of intact ZGs exposed to AQP1 antibody demonstrate little labeling (B,C). (Bar = 200 nm.) Contrarily, SLO-treated ZG demonstrate intense gold labeling at the luminal side of the ZG membrane (D,E). AQP1 regulates GTP-induced water entry in ZG. Schematic diagram of ZG membrane depicting AQP1-specific antibody binding to the carboxy domain of AQP1 at the intragranular side, to block water gating (F). AQP1 antibody introduced into ZG blocks GTP-induced water entry and swelling (from G to H, following GTP exposure; G,H,K). However, only vehicle introduced into ZG, retains the GTP-stimulable effect (from I to J, following GTP exposure; I–K). (See

Color Plate 19 following p. 274. From ref. 27.) GTP-induced water entry was inhibited (Fig. 7G,H,K). However, in the absence of AQP1-specific antibody, SLO permeabilized ZGs elicit strong GTPinduced swelling (% volume increase of 21.95 ± 4.42; see Fig. 7I–K). These studies demonstrate that at pH 6.5, AQP1 participates in GTP-induced gating of water in ZG of pancreatic acinar cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the carboxyl domain of AQP1 does not participate in water entry (40). However, the inhibition of AQP1 by the antibody could result from the structural distortion of AQP1 by binding of the comparatively larger antibody molecule. To understand

the detailed pathway of GTP-induced signaling in the regulation of AQP1 in ZG membrane, further studies are being conducted. Studies using liposomes reconstituted with AQP1, the Gαi3 protein, and other signaling molecules will help elucidate the molecular mechanism of Gαi3-mediated and GTP-induced AQP1involvement in water entry into ZG.
