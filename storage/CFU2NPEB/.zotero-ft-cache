Abstract
The goal of this project is to automate and simplify the ordinarily arcane task of selecting the parameters “settings ” ) for biological image analysis systems ( using the common notions of coverage and complexity. This is essential for broadening the scope of applicability of these algorithms. The p roblem of automated parameter selection is formulated as a variational optimization based on mathematical descriptions of segmentation conciseness nd a coverage, a probabilistic vesselness measure, scale, and the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Of specific interest to us s the analysis of i tube- like biological objects such as tumor micro-vasculature and neurons. Next, the efficient Recursive Random Search (RRS) global optimiz ation algorithm is utilized to explore the parameter space in an effic ient and parallel manner. As an example, the resulting parameter set after 1000 RRS steps for all nine parameters of our automated tracing algorithm produces segmentation results that are within 5% of the globally optimal result, as compared to more than 300,000 steps that would be needed by an exhaustive search. Several examples representing progressively more complex search spaces a re provided to demonstrate the power and broad applicability of this method. The parameter sets that produce optimal segmentation across different biological objects and imaging modalities, using different segmentation algorithms are presented to demonstrate the generality of this approach. Instead of manually hand -tuning empirical parameters that still inevitably contain human subjectivity, users can now objectively obtain optimal segmentat ion result automatically, across a broad domain of applications.

Technical Approach
The variational formulation for image segmentation is expressed mathematically using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) formulation [1]. This is analogous to the problem of fitting a polynomial to a set of points, where the goal is to find a trade-off between the degree of the polynomial (conciseness) and the corresponding fitting error (coverage). Let an image segmentation algorithm be a function f : { I , ?} → M that maps the object(s ) imaged in the image I to the segmented object(s ) M using a parameter vector ? ∈Ω where Ω is the space containing all possible parameter ˆ vectors. Now, the goal becomes to obtain the optimal M , called M , in terms of conciseness and coverage.

Updated Parameters

The conciseness and coverage Description Length metric, is calculated for traces that result from a full-mesh combination of two tracing parameters, maximum allowed stopping violations and contrast threshold multiplier. The traces are shown in (B), (C), (D), and (E), and the corresponding metric value is pointed in (A), where (B) is the optimal trace.

State of the Art
Metrics for segmentation evaluation [4-10] can be either goaloriented, i.e. evaluation based on the performance of postsegmentation steps such as pattern classification [9], based on other application- defined criteria, such as the probability of false detection [6, 7, 10], or based on visual inspections [4]. Here, we restric t ourselves to the latter category, since we believe that optimality of the segmentation result should be compatible with and independent of any post-segmentation image analysis steps. The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle [1] is chosen since it offers a systematic way to obtain an objective balance between segmentation conciseness and coverage. We present a different MDL-based formulation, i.e. compared to [11 -12], where the formulation now contains a term to account for the probability of structural presence at each pixel. This search of optimal parameters is analogous to the variational formulation for image segmentation [12].

Then, the image is segmented using a particular set of parameters, and the resulting segmented image is evaluated using the MDL -based metric. An efficient global optimization algorithm, the Recursive Random Search [3], is used to explore the parameter space using the metric as defined using the MDL principle.

Conclusions
The presented approach removes the human subjectivity factor whe n selecting parameters/settings for an image analysis system. It also reveals the practical limitations of a particular image analysis system, especially when the system is used to analyze images of kinds that it is not designed for. The broad applicability of this method is demonstrated by the ex perimental results. Essentially, all the parameters of an image analysis system are mapped onto user -friendlier terms.
