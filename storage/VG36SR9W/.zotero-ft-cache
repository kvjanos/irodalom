siRNAs: APPLICATIONS IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS AND POTENTIAL AS THERAPEUTICS
Yair Dorsett and Thomas Tuschl
Molecules that can specifically silence gene expression are powerful research tools. Much effort has been put into the development of such molecules and has resulted in the creation of different classes of potential therapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is one of the latest additions to the repertoire of sequence-specific gene-silencing agents. The robustness of this approach has motivated numerous biotechnology organizations and academic institutions to develop siRNA libraries for high-throughput genome-wide screening in mammalian cells. This article first overviews current nucleic-acid-based approaches for gene silencing, and then focuses on the application of siRNAs in particular in functional genomics and as potential therapeutics.

Classical genetic approaches identify gene mutations that disrupt the function or pathway being studied. The recovery and mapping of mutations affecting phenotypes is time-consuming and usually not easily applied to mammalian systems. Reverse genetic approaches involve the disruption of a gene with an unknown or suspected function to determine the effect on a function or pathway; in many cases, this is also expensive and time-consuming. Now that the genomes of many key model organisms have been largely sequenced, nucleicacid-based approaches that act to silence gene expression in a sequence-specific manner have become powerful tools for investigating gene function. These nucleic acid molecules are also being developed as therapeutic agents that target viruses and disease-causing genes. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are one of the most recent additions to the wide repertoire of nucleic acid molecules used to silence gene expression. siRNAs are the effector molecules of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway1,2, which was discovered in 1998 when Andrew Fire and Craig Mello injected double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, initiating a potent sequence-specific degradation of cytoplasmic mRNAs containing the same sequence as the dsRNA trigger3,4. The discovery of RNAi in nematodes made it apparent that post-transcriptional gene

silencing (PTGS) in plants, and quelling in fungi, were fundamentally related processes that were also triggered by dsRNA. RNAi was rapidly developed as a tool to study gene function, and was found to occur in protozoa and almost all higher eukaryotes tested4–8. These early applications used long dsRNA, but long dsRNA was not effective in most mammalian cells because it induced the antiviral INTERFERON (IFN) response9, which usually leads to cell death. Genetic and biochemical investigations of the mechanisms guiding RNAi in different organisms revealed the conservation of cellular machinery that cleaves long dsRNA into duplexes of 21- to 28-nucleotide siRNAs, which guide the sequence-specific degradation of mRNAs2,10–12 (FIG. 1). The elucidation of siRNA structure led to the discovery that siRNAs can effectively reduce gene expression in many mammalian cell types without triggering the IFN response13–15. RNAi provides a new, reliable method to investigate gene function that has many advantages over other nucleic-acid-based approaches, and which is therefore currently the most widely used gene-silencing technique in functional genomics. Previous extensive research on the development of therapeutic antisense nucleic acids should facilitate development of therapeutic siRNAs. This review will give a brief overview of the most popular

Double-stranded (ds) RNA can be produced endogenously within the cell, as in the case of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long dsRNA produced by genomic transcription of long sense and antisense RNAs. Alternatively, dsRNA can be introduced directly into the cell through a dsRNA virus or by experimental manipulation. The dsRNA present is cleaved by the Dicer enzyme within the cell into 21- to 28-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or miRNAs that are passed on to protein complexes by the dsRNA-binding protein R2D2, forming RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs).

modifications thereof have been used to target dsDNA for the inhibition of transcription by the formation of triple helices26. Ribozymes. Ribozymes bind to RNA through Watson– Crick base pairing and act to degrade target RNA by catalysing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester backbone27 (FIG. 3). There are several different classes of ribozymes, with the ‘hammerhead’ ribozyme being the most widely studied. As its name implies, the hammerhead ribozyme forms a unique secondary structure when hybridized to its target mRNA. The catalytically important residues within the ribozyme are flanked by target-complementary sequences that flank the target RNA cleavage site. Cleavage by a ribozyme requires divalent ions, such as magnesium, and is also dependent on target RNA structure and accessibility28. Co-localizing a ribozyme with a target RNA within the cell through the use of localization signals greatly increases their silencing efficiency29. The hammerhead ribozymes are short enough to be chemically synthesized or can be transcribed from vectors30, allowing for the continuous production of ribozymes within cells. siRNAs. siRNAs found in nature are derived from the cytoplasmic processing of long dsRNA by the RNase-IIItype enzyme termed Dicer31.

Several different types of molecule that act to inhibit gene expression by sequence-specific targeting of mRNAs have been developed in the hope of creating therapeutic agents. The three major nucleic-acidbased gene-silencing molecules are chemically modified antisense oligodeoxyribonucleic acids (ODNs), ribozymes and siRNAs16. Less-utilized antisense molecules include peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)17, morpholino phosphorodiamidates 18, DNAzymes 19–21 and the recently developed 5′-end-mutated U1 small nuclear RNAs22. siRNAs, ODNs and ribozymes silence gene expression through different mechanisms, as shown in FIGS 1,2,3. ODNs. ODNs are generally ~20 nucleotides in length and act by hybridizing to pre-mRNA and mRNA to produce a substrate for ribonuclease H (RNase H), which specifically degrades the RNA strand of the formed RNA–DNA duplexes23 (FIG. 2). If modified in a way to prevent the action of RNase H, ODNs can inhibit translation of mRNA via steric hindrance24, or inhibit splicing of pre-mRNAs 25 (FIG. 2). ODNs and

into 21- to 28-nucleotide siRNA duplexes that contain 2-nucleotide 3′ overhangs with 5′ phosphate and 3′ hydroxyl termini (FIG. 4). Components of the RNAi machinery specifically recognize the siRNA duplex and incorporate a single siRNA strand into a protein complex32 termed the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)10. RISC cleaves mRNAs containing perfectly complementary sequences, 10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the incorporated siRNA strand12. Like ribozymes, siRNAs can be synthetically produced or expressed from vectors transcribing short double-stranded hairpin-like RNAs that are processed into siRNAs inside the cell. Unlike ODNs and ribozymes, siRNAs cannot effectively target pre-mRNAs for degradation in mammalian cells33. Evidence exists that several organisms use RNAi-related mechanisms to also target CHROMATIN modifications and transcriptionally silence genes34–44. siRNAs resemble non-coding RNA molecules termed microRNAs (miRNAs) that are naturally used by cells to regulate gene expression45,46. A mature miRNA is a singlestranded molecule of 21- to 22-nucleotides that is excised in the cytoplasm from a 70-nucleotide hairpin precursor47. The mature miRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex (miRNP) that associates with ribosomes and inhibits translation of mRNAs containing sequences partially complementary to the miRNA in their 3′ untranslated region (UTR)48–52. If presented with a substrate with perfect complementarity, an miRNA molecule can act like an siRNA and guide multiple rounds of mRNA degradation53.
Comparison of gene-silencing approaches

CHROMATIN

Complex of DNA, histones and non-histone proteins from which eukaryotic chromosomes are formed.

Several groups have compared different aspects of gene silencing mediated by ODNs and siRNAs in tissue culture models54–60. Drawing conclusions from these studies is not straightforward, because the effectiveness of gene silencing depends on the concentration of silencing reagent, transfection technique, cell type, target site selection, chemical modifications and the time point at which data were analysed. None of the analyses conducted so far has taken all of these parameters into

consideration. The finding that the sequence of an siRNA molecule itself affects silencing efficiency independently of target site accessibility further complicates comparison of ODNs with siRNAs61–63. How crucial target accessibility is for the various gene silencing techniques remains a matter of debate. RNA-binding proteins and extensive secondary or tertiary structures within mRNA are suggested to interfere with the hybridization of ODNs to their target RNA molecules. Several groups have investigated whether these variables also affect the efficiency of siRNAs56,58,59,63. Most of these studies have found a direct correlation between the efficiency of an ODN and an siRNA relative to the target position on mRNA. All studies except two59,64 have also suggested that siRNAs are far more potent and longer-lasting than various types of ODN55–58,60. It is estimated that the half-maximal inhibition levels (IC50) of siRNAs are some 100- to 1,000-fold lower than an optimal phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide65 directed against the same target55–57. Although a systematic and extensive comparison of the gene silencing efficiency mediated by ribozymes and/or DNAzymes and siRNAs has yet to be done, several experiments have indicated that siRNAs are also more effective than ribozymes and DNAzymes66,67. Long hairpin loops that seem to silence gene expression by RNAi are also more potent than hammerhead ribozymes68. All three major approaches for targeting mRNA degradation have the potential for nonspecific effects on gene expression. ODNs, especially when phosphorothioate-modified, can be toxic because they act nonspecifically by binding endogenous proteins69. The high concentration at which ODNs must be used to elicit gene-silencing activity further compounds this problem. ODNs with the CpG motif have also been shown to induce expression of IFNs or other innate immune responses through the binding of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)70–72. This nonspecific property of ODNs has actually been discovered to be the reason for the therapeutic properties of several successful ODNs 73,74.

Because ribozymes, like ODNs, hybridize to their targets without assistance, relatively high concentrations are also needed to silence genes, and unspecific effects can occur, especially when the ribozymes are chemically modified. The use of RNA localization signals or RNA chaperones can overcome this problem, allowing for potent silencing with a relatively low concentration of ribozyme75. Recent data have demonstrated that humans and mice express TLRs that are activated by uridine/guanosine- and uridine-rich single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, respectively76,77. Activation of these TLRs by single-stranded RNA seems to occur in the endosomal compartment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and results in the expression of IFN-γ and other cytokines. If chemically modified siRNAs or ribozymes delivered in vivo are endocytosed and denatured, they can, depending on the siRNA sequence, activate these particular TLRs. This potential side effect could, like CpG motifs in antisense ODNs, be beneficial for therapy of viral infections or cancer. The low concentration of siRNA required to elicit effective gene silencing, and the fact that siRNAs are specifically and rapidly incorporated into RISC, diminishes the potential for the nonspecific binding of proteins. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated that transfection of siRNAs at moderate concentrations does not cause global nonspecific effects on gene expression78–80. Three recent reports, however, have demonstrated that the application of RNAi in mammalian cells can affect gene expression nonspecifically, depending on siRNA concentration, cell type, delivery reagent and mode of siRNA expression81–83. These nonspecific effects include the stimulation of subsets of genes involved in the IFN response, although the induction of IFN response genes in these studies did not cause cellular growth arrest, as would be expected if a true IFN response were activated. In agreement, the microarray gene profiles of HeLa cells transfected with long dsRNA, or treated with IFN type 1 or a high concentration of luciferase siRNA (200 nM), only partly overlap81. These studies describe the potential for side effects in the application of siRNAs in therapeutics and investigative applications, and emphasize the importance of identifying effective siRNAs so that the lowest possible concentration of siRNA is used for gene silencing. It will be interesting to see if mice treated with short-hairpinRNA-producing vectors, or siRNAs, display induction of IFN-response genes. Besides their nonspecific effects, nucleic-acid-based gene-silencing molecules are also prone to inducing off-target effects by targeting sequences closely related to the target of interest. The level of off-target effect is dependent on the mode of silencing and the stability of the nucleic acid hybrid. ODNs are particularly likely to induce off-target effects, because as few as six or seven contiguous DNA/RNA base pairs can be recognized by RNase H84. To circumvent this problem, antisense oligonucleotide gapmers were developed, resulting in only one stretch of ~10 nucleotides of ODNs that can elicit an RNase H response85. Detailed investigations of how siRNAs function have revealed artefacts caused by unintentional targeting of mRNAs. If siRNAs are not carefully selected, siRNAs having partial complementarity to an mRNA target can act like endogenous miRNAs and repress translation 86–88 or subject mRNAs to degradation78. The latter study, which compared the gene-expression profiles created by different siRNAs targeted against the same transcript, revealed that in extreme cases as little as 11- to 14-nucleotide complementarity between the 5′ end of either siRNA strand to an mRNA can cause a reproducible reduction in transcript levels78. Phenotypes identified in RNAi screens should later be confirmed with different siRNAs targeting the same transcript89. If antisense sequences are carefully selected, ODNs, ribozymes, DNAzymes and siRNAs are able to selectively target a particular allele that differs from another by as little as a single nucleotide66,90–94. The remainder of this review will focus on aspects of siRNA-mediated gene silencing.

Figure 3 | Mechanisms of nucleic-acid-based approaches for gene silencing: ribozymes. General mechanism by which ribozymes silence gene expression. Ribozymes can be produced within the cell through transcription or can be directly introduced into the cell through experimental manipulation. For the hammerhead ribozyme, two arms are used to direct the catalytic centre to target the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester backbone of the mRNA.

After the discovery of catalytic RNA, and the very small hammerhead ribozyme in particular, synthetic ribozyme-based therapeutics were intensively explored. Because small RNA molecules can either be chemically synthesized or expressed from DNA vectors, they were also examined as targeting reagents in gene therapy. The development of vectors that produce hammerhead ribozymes from an RNA polymerase III promoter (pol III) facilitated the development of similar vectors for production of siRNAs95. Production of siRNAs from a vector has predominantly been done through the transcription of a hairpin RNA that structurally mimics an miRNA precursor, allowing it to be processed into an siRNA inside the cell. TABLE 1 provides a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of vectors versus synthetic siRNAs. Vectors can stably integrate into the genome and mediate the long-term knockdown of endogenous transcripts in cell culture and in vivo.

High-pressure tail vein injection of siRNAs in physiological solution was the first procedure to successfully deliver siRNAs into highly vascularized mouse tissue115,117–119,121–123, causing up to 90% reduction in target gene expression in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the lung, kidney, spleen and pancreas. The silencing is transient, in certain cases lasting more than a week, and the levels of silencing are not absolute because there is significant animal-to-animal variation. Development of siRNA-producing viruses holds great promise as an alternative mode of gene therapy for DOMINANT human diseases, as well as for studying gene function in mammalian model systems96,101,102,104. Several different types of virus have been engineered to produce siRNAs. Recombinant AAV can mediate the delivery and long-term expression of a transgene in both dividing and non-dividing mammalian cells. The virus is mostly found in an episomal form that integrates randomly and at a low frequency into the host genome. Incredibly, injection of siRNA-producing AAV into mouse brain resulted in effective silencing near the injection site for up to seven weeks after infection101. Delivery of siRNA-producing adenovirus to mouse liver by injection into the tail vein, or to mouse brain by direct injection, has also resulted in effective silencing of gene expression96. siRNA-producing lentiviruses that are able to transduce non-dividing cells and that escape transcriptional silencing during development have been used to deliver siRNAs into embryonic stem cells to create knockdown mice (see below)104. At the moment, there is no obvious reason why siRNA-producing viral vectors cannot be applied to gene therapy by using a strategy similar to that used to deliver ribozymes for the treatment of HIV currently in Phase I and II clinical trials124. siRNAs have been shown to successfully target HIV in tissue culture models125. If siRNAs are to be used for therapeutic purposes, methods must be developed that will allow the gentle delivery of siRNAs in vivo. Such methods, although still imperfect, have been developed for the delivery of ODNs126, including ingestion of chemically modified ODNs127,128, one of which has been given Orphan Drug status by the US FDA129. The recently discovered small molecules that enhance the transdermal penetration of several macromolecules130, including ODNs, could potentially be used for the systemic delivery of siRNAs through a transdermal patch. Aerosol methods similar to those used for gene delivery in the lungs131 might also be used for the gentle delivery of siRNAs in the near future. It remains to be seen whether and which chemically modified siRNAs enhance in vivo delivery. In order not to be limited to the current repertoire of ODN and ribozyme chemical modifications, new types of chemical modification are currently being developed for siRNAs.

Figure 4 | Features of efficient and specific siRNAs. The thermodynamic stability of the first few base pairs of either siRNA strand can affect the ratio of RISCs containing the antisense (red line) or sense strands of siRNAs. The relatively low thermodynamic stability (blue shaded box) in the 5′ end of the antisense strand compared with the high thermodynamic stability (green shaded box) in the 5′ end of the sense strand leads to a bias for the incorporation of the antisense strand into RISC. More RISCs containing antisense strands means a more effective siRNA and also diminishes the chance of off-target effects caused by the sense strand. The 5′ half of siRNAs have a more significant role in target recognition than the 3′ half. As few as 11 to 14 contiguous base pairs from the 5′ end of the siRNA and an mRNA have been observed to target gene silencing.

These viral vectors could one day be applied as an alternative mode of gene therapy (see below). To increase their utility for cell culture studies, vectors that mediate inducible pol III expression of siRNAs were developed103,106–108. The development of a pol-II-based vector that can produce a several-hundred-base-pair hairpin RNA in vivo without inducing the IFN response has provided an alternative method for RNAi in mammals, while also permitting the creation of tissue-specific ‘knockdown’ mice109. To overcome induction of the IFN response owing to the presence of long dsRNA in the cytoplasm, efficient export of the RNA to the cytoplasm is prevented.
In vivo delivery of siRNAs

DOMINANT DISEASE

A disease caused by a dominant genetic mutation.

ODNs and ribozymes have been successfully delivered in vivo using a variety of strategies. Intravenous injection is currently the most popular mode of delivery of ODNs in ongoing clinical trials. Successful delivery of siRNAs, siRNA-producing plasmids or siRNA-producing viruses into mammalian model organisms has been carried out using various methods. These methods include electroporation110–113 and both local96,101,114–116 and systemic injection96,115,117–123 procedures. It is difficult to make generalizations about which delivery method leads to the most effective silencing, however, because different tissues have different requirements for effective delivery, especially for animals of different sizes.

RNAi is a promising tool for mouse and rat gene function analysis, and has allowed for the creation of knockdown mice that in certain contexts offer advantages over the classical method of homologous recombination

(FIG. 5). The silencing mediated by RNAi constructs in

mice is stably passed on through the germline 132. With RNAi, one could easily target particular splice variants of a gene for destruction63. Multicopy genes that are functionally redundant can theoretically all be knocked-down with one transgene construct. By targeting a conserved domain, an entire gene family can be knocked down. RNAi can also overcome the current difficulties in creating double-knockout mice of two genes that are in close proximity on the same chromosome. siRNAs have also broadened the horizons of the types of experiments that can be done in mammalian model systems. For example, to determine the relative amount of gene product needed for certain processes at particular developmental stages, it is now possible to modulate gene dosage in a spatial and temporal manner by simply varying the amount of siRNA expressed in the cell133. Current difficulties in creating temporally and spatially restricted knockout mice include identifying regulatory regions that can express recombinase proteins in the desired patterns. Several groups have used RNAi to rapidly circumvent this problem by the local injection or electroporation of siRNA-producing plasmids or viruses96,101,112,134. The refinement of selection methods for effective and specific hairpins, as well as the refinement of expression and delivery techniques for siRNAs, will make mouse knockdowns a useful technique for future research. It should, however, be cautioned that it is uncertain whether long-term expression of siRNAs in mice can cause side effects. Long-term expression of high levels of hairpin RNAs could, in theory, compete with endogenously expressed miRNAs for incorporation into miRNPs.
siRNAs as tools for genome-wide screening

SATURATING GENETIC SCREEN

A screen of sufficient scale to identify all possible target genes.

RNAi has become the preferred approach for functional genomics in several model systems135. Several neargenome-wide RNAi screens have been conducted using long dsRNA in C. elegans136–146 and Drosophila melanogaster147–149. These screens have identified genes

involved in fundamental processes such as cell division, apoptosis and cell morphology, and physiological processes such as fat metabolism. Until recently, genetic screens were mostly limited to non-mammalian model organisms, and only a few nonsaturating genetic screens had been conducted in mice150–154. This prompted the use of other vertebrate model organisms, such as zebrafish, in which SATURATING GENETIC SCREENS could be carried out relatively easily and affordably. Current reverse genetic approaches for studying embryonic development in zebrafish use antisense molecules, termed morpholino phosphorodiamidates18, because RNAi using long dsRNA does not seem to work in zebrafish155, even though zebrafish do contain miRNAs156. With the advent of siRNAs, it is now feasible to carry out reverse genetic screens in mammalian tissue culture cells, Xenopus oocytes157, chicken embryos158 and, potentially, mouse and rat embryos112,159,160. It is not established whether siRNAs are functional in zebrafish. Such screens will bypass the time-consuming task of identifying and validating clear mammalian homologues, as well as providing a means to easily discern new mechanisms that are specific to mammals. It has finally become feasible to conduct a relatively rapid identification of human-specific processes through targeting of human-specific genes in different cell types. Reverse genetic approaches that used either ODNs or ribozymes to reduce the expression of specific genes have proven successful for use in drug target validation, but have never passed the hurdle of genome-wide target identification. RNAi has become the preferred approach for functional genomics in mammalian tissue culture. There are several reasons for this choice, including the high gene-silencing efficiency at low concentration, ease of finding accessible target sites, high specificity, good stability and custom siRNA synthesis at moderately low cost. Several large-scale RNAi screens have been conducted in mammalian tissue culture cells using synthetic siRNAs161 or hairpin expression162–164; these screens have identified genes involved in apoptosis, signalling, regulation of protein stability and the ultraviolet radiation damage response.

The potential of genome-wide screening by RNAi in mammals for identifying new therapeutic drug targets is only limited by the types of screens one can do: a mammalian RNAi-based screen can be carried out for any process for which a tissue culture model exists. As with classical genetic approaches, modifier screens, which look to identify suppressors or enhancers of particular processes, can be conducted, depending on the experimental setup. The mammalian siRNA-based screens conducted so far have also accommodated the use of extracellular agents to induce particular processes. For the most part, RNAi-based screening in mammalian cells has been limited to easily transfectable, rapidly dividing adherent cell types. However, one could imagine conducting a screen for factors that mediate cellular differentiation using totipotent or pluripotent stem cell lines. Electroporation techniques currently used to deliver siRNAs to non-adherent cells could potentially be used for high-throughout screening (HTS)165. With regard to electroporation, siRNAs are preferable to hairpin-producing vectors, as the conditions for effective delivery of siRNAs are milder than for plasmids and result in less cell death166. New modes of siRNA delivery could arise from the identification of

siRNA chemical modifications that facilitate uptake in primary and/or non-adherent cells. Future smallmolecule drug screens might identify molecules that stimulate siRNA uptake in particular cell types. Viral vectors that are able to transduce primary cells have recently been applied as a mode of delivery for RNAibased screens164. With the development of such technologies, the rate-limiting steps for RNAi-based screening will soon be screen design and data analysis. RNAi is proving helpful in the validation of potential drug targets identified by the use of cDNA microarrays167,168. Large amounts of microarray data have been produced in an effort to identify genes whose expression in disease tissue deviates from that of normal-tissue gene expression. These microarray studies usually identify hundreds, if not thousands, of genes that have altered expression, making it difficult to identify the relevant drug targets; siRNAs designed to target genes that are overexpressed in disease tissue can now be used to rapidly identify suitable drug targets for a particular disease. The current rate-limiting step for genome-wide screening in mammalian cells is resource availability. Technologies that combine 96- or 384-well plate formats,

dsRNA would also have this advantage, although the fraction of effective siRNAs cannot be controlled178. siRNAs produced with this procedure should be further purified, to remove small amounts of unprocessed dsRNA that could induce the IFN response. Although screening by RNAi is relatively fast and easy, it has several disadvantages when compared with classical genetic screens. Most significantly, classical genetic screens can identify mutations that are not in coding regions. Classical genetic screens can also produce dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations, which are often useful, and sometimes essential, for understanding gene function. To overcome some of these pitfalls, arrayed adenovirus cDNA expression libraries (knock-ins) are being used in combination with arrayed adenovirus libraries that express short hairpin RNAs97. Another pitfall of screening with RNAi is that siRNAs almost never fully deplete the target mRNA and usually several different siRNAs must be screened before an effective siRNA is identified. Transient RNAi in rapidly dividing tissue culture cells usually lasts three to five days. However, even if applied to slowly dividing cells, it is possible that an effective siRNA will have difficulty in depleting a stable protein. Another layer of complexity to consider when designing siRNA-based screens is cell type. The amount of available RISC can vary between cell types, possibly reflecting the relative levels of endogenous miRNAs competing for the RNAi machinery, and is a limiting factor for RNAi efficiency63,139. In the long term, the identification of specific and effective siRNAs for each gene will help to overcome some of these problems. Mammalian RNAi-based genomic screens offer great opportunities. The institutions that are developing platforms for high-throughput, genome-wide RNAi screens in mammalian cells will have a competitive advantage in biomedical research. Complementing these siRNA-based screens with proteomic methods will yield a relatively descriptive outlook on particular cellular processes that can be further studied.

cationic transfection, robotics and image recognition software are already being used to conduct near-genomewide screens in mammalian tissue culture cells. New types of hardware platforms for the HTS process are also being developed. Most recently, microarray chips have been developed that use plasmids or siRNAs spotted on glass slides and reverse transfection to allow for rapid screening of mammalian cells169–171. The drawbacks of RNAi microarrays are that only adherent cells can be analysed, the cationic transfection reagent used is restricted to specific cell types and technology must be developed to allow the long-term storage of RNAi microarrays. As the probability of having off-target effects increases with genome size, the importance of careful siRNA design increases. Recent experimental findings61,62,172–174 have aided in the development of siRNA libraries by refining the standard parameters175 for selecting effective siRNAs (FIG. 4). All of these findings converge on the conclusion that the thermodynamic stability of the first few base pairs of both ends of an siRNA duplex are crucial for determining which siRNA strand will be incorporated into RISC. Several groups are designing methods for the high-throughput development of hairpin-producing plasmid libraries162,176,177. Although the parameters for selecting effective siRNAs could also be applied for construction of hairpin vectors, they might be less reliable because the positions at which Dicer RNase III cleaves a hairpin are not well defined. Following the refined parameters for siRNA design does not, however, guarantee an effective siRNA, because the target position within a mRNA might also affect silencing efficiency56,59,63. Besides good siRNA design, pooling of effective siRNAs against the same target also decreases off-target effects. The pooling strategy dilutes out the effect of any siRNAs having off-target effects, while keeping the total of targetgene-specific siRNAs constant. Pooling of siRNAs that are randomly generated in vitro from Dicer cleavage of long

Several ODN and ribozyme molecules are already being tested in clinical trials, and one antisense ODN — fomivirsen (Vitravene; Isis) — has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection of the eye. So far, most of the antisense oligonucleotides in clinical trials are phosphorothioate-modified ODNs65 or phosphorothioate-modified ODN gapmers, which have problems such as toxicity at high concentration and a low affinity for their target RNAs. Several secondgeneration antisense constructs containing additional types of chemical modifications are also currently in clinical trials and are predicted to do better than their phosphorothioate ODN predecessors. A number of recent reviews have covered these different drugs and their targets, so they will not be discussed here further23,124,126. As siRNAs and their functionality in mammalian cells were discovered only three years ago, they have not yet had time to enter clinical trials. There is, however, no

obvious scientific reason why siRNAs will not be used as therapeutics with strategies similar to those that are now used for ODNs and ribozymes. siRNAs are rapidly catching up with ODNs and ribozymes for development as therapeutics after the establishment of siRNA-based biotechnology companies that focus on the development of clinical programmes179. Several proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of siRNAs: siRNAs protected mice from fulminant hepatitis121,122, viral infection123,180, sepsis115, tumour growth181–185 and ocular neovascularization causing macular degeneration114. Given that siRNAs delivered by high-pressure tail vein injection are most effective in the mouse liver, several groups have tested the potential of siRNAs as therapeutic agents for a wide variety of liver diseases. By targeting endogenous genes expressed in the liver that mediate apoptosis, mice pre-treated with siRNAs targeting either caspase 8 (REF.121) or the FAS cell death receptor122 were protected from acute liver failure induced by a variety of reagents. The treatment of mice with the same siRNAs after insult of the liver by apoptosis-inducing reagents also protected mice from liver breakdown. Other groups have successfully demonstrated

the therapeutic potential of siRNAs for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by directly targeting the virus119,120,123. A replication-competent HBV genome was co-delivered with siRNAs targeting portions of the HBV genome to effectively reduce viral replication and protein production.Although promising, it has yet to be demonstrated whether siRNAs can effectively reduce virus levels when applied to a real, ongoing infection. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of siRNAs and should stimulate research into delivery methods that are also suitable for therapeutic applications. Optimizing the effectiveness of nucleic-acid-based gene silencing in vivo requires that numerous parameters be considered. The silencing molecule must be stable in the circulatory system as well as in tissues, and should bind blood proteins to a degree that is non-toxic, but that prevents immediate loss of the molecule through excretion. Much effort has been put into identifying chemical modifications of nucleic acids that decrease their susceptibility to nuclease attack, while allowing them to maintain gene-silencing activity sufficient for therapeutic use57,186,187. The compromises that need to be made for systemic delivery are best illustrated for the

phosphorothioate-modified ODNs currently in clinical trials. Even though the modification decreases the affinity of the ODN to its target RNA, it increases the effectiveness of the molecules in vivo by increasing their stability, retention, cellular uptake and biodistribution. This is because phosphorothioate modifications increase the affinity of ODNs to blood proteins and also prevent the direct action of nucleases that would otherwise degrade the ODNs188. siRNA duplexes are protected from single-strandspecific endonucleases, making them more stable than either ODNs or ribozymes in serum60. However, because stability in sera does not always translate to stability in the blood, and because unmodified siRNAs are not readily taken up by cells nor have a sufficient affinity for blood proteins, siRNAs must also be chemically modified if they are to be used for therapeutic purposes without a genetherapy-based platform that includes the use of viruses. The modification of siRNAs could interfere with incorporation of the siRNA into RISC, unwinding of the siRNA duplex by helicase activities and/or the rate of target cleavage and product release. Several groups have attempted to identify chemical modifications that increase stability of siRNAs while maintaining good silencing efficiency63,175,189–192. TABLES 2 and 3 summarize the various chemical modifications of siRNAs and their effect on gene silencing. Of note, phosphorothioate modifications are well tolerated within siRNA duplexes, suggesting that cells will take up these types of siRNAs, similarly to their ODN and ribozyme counterparts. There are, however, no reports on the effectiveness of chemically modified siRNAs in vivo. A high potential for siRNAs as therapeutic agents has initiated efforts to develop new types of nucleic acid chemical modifications, some of which are specific to siRNA structure. Numerous clinical trials involving therapeutic siRNAs are anticipated in the near future.
Conclusion

We are in the dawn of a new age in functional genomics driven by RNAi methods. Although there are technical challenges associated with the therapeutic application of siRNAs, such as synthesis, delivery and specificity, they currently offer numerous advantages over other gene-silencing approaches. The siRNA approach for gene silencing holds great therapeutic promise, as siRNAs, like miRNAs, are naturally used by cells to regulate gene expression and are therefore nontoxic and highly effective. One potential drawback of using siRNAs for therapeutics is that if used long term, siRNAs could theoretically out-compete the function of endogenous miRNA genes in certain cell types. The years of research done on antisense therapeutics will greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic siRNAs. Further research into the fundamental mechanisms of RNAi could unveil new dimensions of siRNA-mediated gene silencing that will have profound implications for understanding gene regulation, and which could also affect the development of functional genomics and therapeutic applications.
