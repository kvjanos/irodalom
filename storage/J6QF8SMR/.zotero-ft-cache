Abstract Microscopy has been a very powerful tool for Drosophila research since its inception, proving to be essential for the evaluation of mutant phenotypes, the understanding of cellular and tissue physiology, and the illumination of complex biological questions. In this article we review the breadth of this ﬁeld, making note of some of the seminal papers. We expand on the use of microscopy to study questions related to gene locus and nuclear architecture, presenting new data using ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridization techniques that demonstrate the ﬂexibility of Drosophila chromosomes. Finally, we review the burgeoning use of ﬂuorescence in-vivo imaging methods to yield quantitative information about cellular processes.

Introduction Microscopy, a tool to dissect Drosophila Drosophila research has relied on microscopy: (a) to delineate the myriad of mutants by eye color, bristles, bars or wing shape; (b) to determine lethal endpoints in development; and (c) to annotate the breakpoints of translocations by comparison with the long-used maps of Bridges (1935). The ﬁrst in-situ hybridizations were carried out on polytene chromosomes (Spradling et al. 1975), reafﬁrming the correlation of genes to the linear sequence of polytene bands as established by early mapping (Painter 1934), and gene cloning soon allowed the localization of any gene sequence by these techniques (Wensink et al. 1974). P1 phage regional clones in the early

1980s and later YAC and BAC clones of much of the Drosophila genome became available for genome walking and ﬁne mapping (http://ﬂybase.bio.indiana. edu/) (Drysdale & Crosby 2005). In addition, they provided DNA probes for in-situ hybridization that have illuminated the mechanism of transvection and nuclear architecture (Fung et al. 1998, Gemkow et al. 1998); an area that we will treat in detail below and for which we present new data on homolog pairing. Early in the age of molecular genetics by means of b-galactosidase fusions with genes and promoters, the Drosophila community was able to determine expression boundaries of genes and control elements in time and space. However, the great breakthrough was the wedding of ﬂuorescence microscopy with this ideal meso/microscopic organism, possessing a

452 transparent embryo, that opened up the possibility to correlate information about gene activity and localization with structure and developmental stage or mutant phenotype. We need only look at the multicolor Drosophila embryo displaying the gradients of gap and pair rule genes to appreciate the revolution and synergism that resulted from such a union (http://ﬂyex.ams.sunysb.edu/FlyEx/ and composite Figure 1 derived from this site). Detailed information on ontogeny came from the application of ﬂuorescence microscopy by Foe (1989) for the progression of cell replication and division throughout embryogenesis. However, it was not until in-vivo imaging was made possible by the introduction of ﬂuorescently labeled proteins, ﬁrst by microinjection into embryos (Kellogg et al. 1988) and later by the introduction of genes encoding ﬂuorescent proteins, that lineage could be followed for many cell gener-

C. Fritsch et al. ations and the migration of cells speciﬁed in detail. A limited lineage exposition was demonstrated with microinjected, labeled histones and time-lapse microscopy by Minden et al. (1989). Such studies were expanded ﬁrst with in-vivo labeling of cells by lipid probes (Bossing & Technau 1994) and then with green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) markers using tissuespeciﬁc promoters with which the developmental progression of complete organ systems in embryos, larvae and oocytes could be traced (Schmid et al. 1999). In-vivo imaging is not limited to lineage studies but encompasses all manner of functional assays in wild-type and mutant Drosophila. For example, the early technique of histone labeling of embryos allowed our laboratory to determine the in-vivo mechanism of topoisomerase II inhibition by drugs such as VM26 compared with inhibitor antibodies (Buchenau et al. 1993).

Imaging in Drosophila More recently, high-resolution ﬂuorescence microscopy has been employed to observe in vivo the movement of macromolecules within cells, tissues or whole embryos, e.g. by using molecular beacons to track mRNA (Bratu et al. 2003), or by using ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques to study GFP fusions of chromatin protein complexes (Ficz et al. 2005), as will be discussed below. Finally, two techniques have been introduced for the in-vivo study of chromatin mobility and nuclear architecture in Drosophila: (a) the integration of bacterial DNA operator sequences into the Drosophila genome that can bind bacterial repressor proteins fused to GFP, and (b) the expression of photoactivatable GFP fused to histones. These techniques and the results achieved to date are reviewed in the ﬁnal part of this article.

453 observations by FISH: (a) by Gemkow et al. (1998) showing interaction of translocated elements containing PREs on heterologous chromosomes and (b) more recently by Bantignies et al. (2003), who looked by FISH at the homing effect of the Fab-7 locus. In this latter study a segment containing the strong Fab-7 PRE preferentially pairs with the endogenous Fab-7 locus when inserted as a transgene (see also Grimaud et al. 2006). The fact that homolog chromosome pairing begins at the mid-blastula transition in embryonic development was deﬁnitively demonstrated in two laboratories by FISH studies (Fung et al. 1998, Gemkow et al. 1998). The frequency of pairing was dependent on the length of the interphase, reaching a maximum of õ80% in post-mitotic embryonic nuclei. Gemkow et al. (1998) showed that transvection, the phenomenon by which genes are regulated in trans, is most likely promoted by direct pairing and/or looping of the DNA strands from homologous chromosomes. Further evidence for the ﬂexibility of Drosophila chromosomes was obtained in this study by the fact that translocations of a segment containing one copy of the bithorax gene cluster (BX-C) from chromosome 3R to the opposite arm (3L) or to the X chromosome eliminated transvection, but did not abrogate homolog pairing. We were interested as to whether this long-distance pairing was compatible with normal homolog pairing in the adjacent sequences. In the following section we present data to answer this question. We used in-situ hybridization data to compare the pairing frequency of a locus within a translocation segment as well as one near the breakpoint of the segment excised from chromosome 3R to test the ﬂexibility of Drosophila chromatin. The frequency of a P1 Drosophila DNA probe located inside the translocated segment and proximal to the BX-C in female Tp(3;1) P115/w;Df/+ ﬂies (Figure 2A), and those for a probe lying immediately distal to the

FISH in whole mount embryos and imaginal discs Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and highresolution confocal microscopy have provided detailed insights into gene locations and snapshots of the behavior of chromosomal loci throughout development. Using these techniques speciﬁc distances between loci have been measured with the precision afforded by light microscopy and have allowed one to test directly theories concerning transvection and chromosome mobility.

Flexibility of interphase chromosomes Csink & Henikoff (1998) described large-scale chromosomal movements, particularly in S-phase, by analyzing a FISH probe within the 2R centromeric heterochromatin and one at the telomere of 2R. In earlier studies they demonstrated that Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) promotes the association of distant heterochromatic loci and their subsequent silencing (Csink & Henikoff 1996, Dernburg et al. 1996). Sigrist & Pirrotta (1997) observed the consequences of the trans interaction of different Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) inserted on homologous chromosomes that resulted in the suppression of reporter gene transcription. They inferred from their phenotypes that the same PRE inserted on heterologous chromosomes can also interact. Their data are consistent with direct

translocated segment on chromosome 3R in the same line, are given in Table 1. The pairing frequency was signiﬁcantly higher for the segment located outside the loop (Student’s t-test null hypothesis, 0.011) and similar to that found for a variety of loci on chromosomes 2 and 3 in previous studies, demonstrating that the translocation does not inhibit normal homolog pairing in adjacent segments. In addition, the mean pairing frequency of 37% found for the translocated segment was close to that measured for probes in the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) genes (within the BX-C) in this segment (Gemkow et al. 1998) and represents a very signiﬁcant interaction of segments from two nonhomologous chromosomes, the 3R and X. The random association of non-homologous loci without PREs or heterochromatic elements between different chromosomes was less than 1% (data not shown). These data exclude that only the PRE sequences are promoting pairing in the translocated segment. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that Drosophila chromosomes are highly ﬂexible and search for homologous regions over a large part of the nuclear volume. In contrast to these results from Drosophila, homologous pairing has been detected only in mammalian neuronal cells (Arnoldus et al. 1989, 1991) and not in mammalian tissue culture cells, where the only largescale movement in interphase is dependent upon induction of a strong viral promoter (Tumbar et al. 1999) or a change in the state of differentiation (Brown et al. 1999, Volpi et al. 2000).

The inﬂuence of protein interactions on homologous pairing Based on our observations of long-range homolog recognition, we proposed that chromosome pairing in Drosophila is promoted by a multipoint recognition along the chromosome, resulting in globally stable interactions despite relatively unstable (short lifetime) individual associations, and suggested that some of these proteinYprotein interactions responsible for recognition and pairing might be enhancer and/or repressor complexes (Gemkow et al. 1998). Gerasimova et al. (2000) suggested that proteins bound to insulator sequences organize the chromatin into domains by forming higher-order intra- and interchromosomal loops from FISH data. Suppressor of Hairy wing, Su(Hw), is a zinc ﬁnger protein that binds to an octomer repeat found in enhancer elements of various genes as well as to the retrotransposon gypsy insulator (Georgiev & Corces 1995, Geyer 1997, Chen & Corces 2001). Su(Hw) can act in trans and inactivate enhancers located on the homologous chromosome. This phenomenon is inhibited by chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt pairing, suggesting that close apposition between the two copies of the affected gene is important for trans repression of transcription. Thus, we chose to investigate the effect of a null mutation in the su(Hw) gene on homolog pairing in larval imaginal discs. FISH was performed in wild-type and mutant imaginal discs and the frequency of homologous pairing calculated. The data for two P1 DNA probes

that do not contain a gypsy binding site can be found in Table 2. Comparing the results for the mutant and wild-type strains shows that the pairing frequency decreases by õ30% in su(Hw)j/j homozygous embryos. A probe in the BX-C and one outside this region (Figure 2B) were affected similarly. These results imply that PcG complexes alone do not sufﬁce for driving homolog recognition despite their strong effect on homing and long-distance pairing effects cited above. We used the histone gene cluster as a control for these studies. It contains all of the major histones, including the intergenic sequences, in 100 copies arranged in tandem duplication at a single locus in D. melanogaster (Lifton et al. 1978). In embryogenesis the zygotic histone gene cluster is transcribed very early to provide histones to the rapidly dividing embryo. Fung et al. (1998) showed that this locus pairs before any other locus and reaches a higher pairing frequency than other tested sequences in Drosophila embryos. We found that the histone genes were consistently paired in both wild-type and mutant imaginal discs at a frequency of 9 95% (see Table 2 and Figure 2C). The obvious dissociation of this locus from factors that drive recognition of non-repetitive euchromatin is consistent with the special nature of this DNA and its transcriptional properties that may provide an early nucleation site for pairing. Figure 3 plots the normalized frequency of interhomolog distances between the unpaired homologous alleles in su(Hw) mutants compared to distances of unpaired loci in post mitotic wild-type nuclei and early embryonic wild-type nuclei. Early in embryogenesis at cycle 14 (stage 6), when only 10Y20% of the homologs are paired, the distances between unpaired loci are distributed randomly over the whole nuclear volume, whereas in late G1 arrested embryos (9 stage 10), when pairing reaches its

maximum level, the interhomolog distances of the unpaired loci are restricted to small values (mean at õ 1 mm) indicative of only local dissociation and restrained diffusion of the chromatin (see Gemkow et al. 1998, Figure 7, and the discussion in the penultimate section of this article). Although the pairing frequency was signiﬁcantly decreased for loci other than the histone gene cluster, the interhomolog distances for unpaired loci in su(Hw) mutants were small (Figure 3), similar to the distribution of distances found in wild-type post-mitotic embryonic and larval nuclei. Earlier data on zeste mutants in embryos demonstrated local decondensation effects but little reduction in pairing frequencies (Gemkow et al. 1998). Taken together, these data imply that numerous different protein complexes along the chromosomes serve as recognition sites for pairing and that chromatin is in a dynamic equilibrium between pairing and non-pairing. Thus, in most cases, the removal of a single protein species that organizes higher-order complexes will affect local interactions but movements will be constrained by other complexes in adjacent segments.

Dynamics and live cell imaging The cloning of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyﬁsh Aequorea victoria (Chalﬁe et al. 1994) and its expression in eukaryotic cells has revolutionized developmental biology. Many GFPs and coral ﬂuorescent protein derivatives, visible ﬂuorescent proteins (VFPs), have been developed during the past 10 years, allowing the simultaneous observation of as many as six separable VFPs (Miyawaki 2006). Many of these mutants possess increased photostability as well as the property of photoconvertability between different ﬂuorescent forms (Lippincott-Schwartz &

Patterson 2003, Ando et al. 2004). In combination with confocal microscopy, VFPs provide enormous possibilities for labeling cells and whole organisms including the analysis of dynamic processes such as protein diffusion or chromatin movement in vivo. It is impossible to review the plethora of publications that have used VFPs in this area in the past 10 years, and we will therefore restrict our discussion to a few examples of applications in Drosophila from the labeling of whole organisms to the study of protein dynamics.

Whole animals and clones of cells Y GFP marked chromosomes One important feature that made Drosophila such a useful organism for genetic studies is the existence of balancer chromosomes. These special chromosomes contain chromosomal inversions that lead to loss of genes upon recombination with their homologous segments resulting in embryonic lethality, and thus provide a means to maintain mutants in heterologous crosses or lines. Balancers exist for chromosomes X, 2 and 3; the fourth Drosophila chromosome is very small, heterochromatic, and usually does not recom-

bine. Balancer chromosomes carry dominant markers that help to identify them in adult ﬂies. The addition of GFP as a marker for balancers has made it possible to identify ﬂies that carry these balancers at much earlier developmental stages (Casso et al. 1999, Halfon et al. 2002). Starting in embryos at the extended germband stage GFP expression driven by the Kruppel promoter, for example, can be detected in all stages through embryonic and larval development as well as in pupae and adult ﬂies. Homozygous mutant animals can be selected, due to the absence of the GFP marker even if they do not show a mutant phenotype at a given stage, and thus be subjected to gene expression microarray analysis (Furlong et al. 2001a,b). GFP has also proved to be an indispensable tool to mark homozygous mutant clones of cells induced within a tissue by use of an FLP recombination target (FRT) sequence close to their centromeres that mediates mitotic recombination induced by the expression of FLP recombinase (Xu & Rubin 1993) in a certain tissue or under the control of a heatshock promoter. The homologous chromosome with an FRT site near the mutation of interest is recombined to produce a clone of homozygous mutant cells labeled by the absence of GFP within a green tissue. With this

Imaging in Drosophila method one can analyze alterations of gene expression in the mutant clones (Beuchle et al. 2001) or generate germline clones resulting in embryos that lack maternal gene products (Luschnig et al. 2004).

457 The most obvious use of VFP fusion proteins has been to localize and quantitate proteins and subcellular compartments throughout development. Similarly they have been applied to questions of chromatin protein localization, e.g. Polycomb (Dietzel et al. 1999) and Cid, the Drosophila CENP-A homologue (Ahmad & Henikoff 2001).

Speciﬁc cells, tissues and subcellular compartments The GAL4/UAS enhancer trap technique (Brand & Perrimon 1993, Gerlitz et al. 2002) allows the expression of a reporter gene fused to the upstream activating sequence (UAS) from yeast to be expressed in the presence of Gal4. Random insertion of the reporter gene construct allows transcription under the control of endogenous enhancers with readout of the enhancer phenotype through expression patterns of the fusion protein (see Marr et al. 2006). Originally bacterial bgalactosidase was used as the reporter, but VFP readout affords certain advantages, such as: (a) no need for prior ﬁxation or the addition of substrates or antibodies; (b) real-time observation of living embryos and larvae as well as cultured egg chambers; (c) high-resolution analysis using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images (Yeh et al. 1995); (d) ﬂuorescence-assisted cell sorter (FACS) selection of dissociated GFP-labeled tissues for expression array analysis (Amrein & Axel 1997); and (e) cell lineage analysis (Murray et al. 1998, Kraut & Zinn 2004).

Dynamics of individual chromosomal regions and loci associated with GFP fusion proteins In a previous section of the article we presented evidence for chromosome mobility from FISH data that provide Fsnapshots_ in time of dynamic processes. The use of GFP probes attached to chromosomal loci or associated with tightly bound chromosomal proteins constitutes an in-vivo method for ascertaining chromosomal mobility directly. We have used transgenic Drosophila embryos, expressing an H2AvDGFP fusion protein (Clarkson & Saint 1999, Saint & Clarkson 2000) to observe the distribution of the chromatin in living embryos as shown in the supplementary movie of real-time chromatin movement in a live cycle 13 embryo. One can discern chromatin associations all along the nuclear envelope as well as long-range chromatin movement over second and minute time scales, particularly in the interior of the nucleus. Such rapid movement is reminiscent of loci consisting of lac operator arrays

458 in yeast nuclei (Heun et al. 2001a,b). Similar chromatin movement was observed in Drosophila larval imaginal discs using Pc-GFP or Ph-GFP fusion proteins (see Figure 3 and supplementary movie 1 in Ficz et al. 2005). The marking of the entire genome by the variant histone H2AvD-GFP does not permit tracking of individual loci for quantitation of diffusion constants. However, the mutation of the GFP to a photoactivatable GFP (paGFP) (Post et al. 2005), followed by simultaneous two-photon activation of loci of 0.2Y0.8 mm2 in nuclei of embryos and larval explants, provided a means to perform 2-D tracking and to compare various nuclear locations at a variety of development stages (Post et al. manuscript in preparation). In another method for tracking individual chromosomal loci, a GFP-labeled lac repressor is targeted to its high-afﬁnity binding sequence, the E. coli lactose operator (lacO), integrated into eukaryotic chromatin (Robinett et al. 1996, Straight et al. 1996). The relatively high background of unbound lac repressor can be compensated for by the size of the lacO insertion or by modulating the expression levels of lac repressor protein to achieve a good locus signal to background. On the other hand, the background staining of unbound lac repressor can also be utilized to visualize the size and shape of the nuclei without additional staining, although nuclear membrane

C. Fritsch et al. labeling by another VFP protein is to be desired for very accurate determination of the nuclear boundary (Heun et al. 2001a,b) (Figure 4AYC). P-elements allow the efﬁcient insertion of small lacO arrays in Drosophila without tandem duplication of the arrays with endogenous sequences such as occurs in mammalian genomes. The ﬁrst application in Drosophila of the lacO system was for the analysis of chromatin movement in premeiotic nuclei of spermatocytes, a highly specialized tissue (Vazquez et al. 2001). In this tissue chromatin undergoes both short-range (fast) and long-range (slow) constrained random motion with a larger radius of gyration for the latter. Recently Thakar & Csink (2005) demonstrated that chromatin movement is more constrained in differentiated than in undifferentiated cells with the lacO system, presumably due to a general nuclear contraction and/or chromatin compaction as cells become smaller. The authors used Drosophila eye imaginal discs in which it was possible to analyze the undifferentiated cells in front of the morphogenetic furrow together with differentiated cells after the morphogenetic furrow in one and the same disc. In an analogous approach to the lacO/GFP lac repressor system, Buchenau et al. (1997) injected a ﬂuorescently labeled antibody against Hrb57A, a Drosophila homolog of hnRNP K proteins, into living Drosophila embryos. Upon heatshock the Hrb57A protein localizes mainly to the 93D locus,

Imaging in Drosophila resulting in a bright spot that can be tracked. Individual loci showed different types of movements: jitter, slow movements, rapid movements over both large and small distances and, apparently, both random walk and directed movements. However, this approach allowed the tracking of only one speciﬁc chromatin locus under stress conditions. In the same year Marshall et al. reported the injection of ﬂuorescently labeled antibody to topoisomerase II which shows a very large accumulation at the 359 bp satellite repeat sequence on the X chromosome and thereby measured chromatin dynamics (Marshall et al. 1997) (see Table 3). Taken together, the results obtained with these live cell methods demonstrate that chromatin can move by random diffusion as well as by ATP-dependent translocations whereby the rates and radius of gyration differ between species, and even between different cell types within a species, being inﬂuenced by parameters such as cell cycle, differentiation stage or position and size of the chromosomal marker (see Table 3) (also reviewed by Belmont 2003). New

459 microscopy techniques that allow faster imaging combined with reduced phototoxicity, such as twophoton microscopy, should help to resolve the basis for these differences in the future (Levi et al. 2005).

Dynamics of chromatin binding proteins In addition to all the features listed above, VFP fusion proteins can be used to directly measure chromatin protein diffusion and binding dynamics using techniques such as ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (reviewed in White & Stelzer 1999, Houtsmuller & Vermeulen 2001, Phair & Misteli 2001). In the FRAP method the VFP ﬂuorescence signal is bleached by an intense laser beam followed by measurement of the ﬂuorescence recovery into the bleached volume. One can distinguish several classes of molecules by this method, and quantitate their biophysical parameters using sophisticated analysis methods and simulations (Sprague et al. 2004, Ficz et al. 2005): (a) unbound,

Imaging in Drosophila freely diffusing molecules; (b) proteins involved in transient binding complexes on the chromatin; and (c) proteins that are tightly bound to chromatin and do not exchange with free protein during the time of the experiment. The core histones are the exceptional case of this latter category. They comprise the basis for DNA compaction and chromatin assembly and are tightly associated such that they can be used to visualize chromatin dynamics GFP- or paGFP fusions (see previous section, Figure 5, and Kimura 2005), whereas most other nuclear proteins interact only transiently with their DNA target sites. It has been found that even proteins involved in heterochromatin formation such as HP1 are exchangeable within 60 seconds (Cheutin et al. 2003). The polycomb group (PcG) proteins, Polycomb (Pc) and Polyhomeotic (Ph), were also shown to bind only transiently to their target sites (Ficz et al. 2005) although PcG proteins form large silencing complexes on chromatin (Shao et al. 1999) and are required throughout development to maintain silencing of their target genes (Beuchle et al. 2001). They are not trapped in the complex but rather are able to exchange completely within a few minutes. Additionally, the complexes have different residence times on individual bands in salivary gland nuclei, indicating that there are differences in the composition of the complexes on different genes (Ficz et al. 2005 and Figure 6). It is to be expected that during the next decade new ways will emerge to combine many of the imaging techniques we have discussed above so as to obtain much more information about chromatin dynamics and the interplay between structure and function in the cell nucleus of the model developing organism Drosophila. Materials and methods DNA and other probes

Drosophila genomic DNA sequences were produced from P1 phage from the collection originally described by Hartl et al. (1994), but are denoted by their present numbers according to Flybase. The probes used for data described in this paper are P1 clones: DS08009, inside the P115 3R translocated segment but not in the BX-C complex; DS04079, lying on the nontranslocated 3R segment distal to the P115 breakpoint; DS03126, part of the Ultrabithorax gene; DS03648, locus in the cytological band 89B11, without annotated genes, as well as a plasmid containing the histone gene cluster (kind gift of A. Udvardy). All DNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin by random priming using the High Prime Kit from Amersham ¨ Buchler (Braunschweig). Monoclonal antibodies against msl-2 and lamin were the kind gifts of M. Kuroda and H. Saumweber, respectively. Fly lines For the transposition analysis Tp(3;1) P115/w;Df/+ ﬂies in which a segment containing the BX-C was translocated from the 3R to the X chromosome were used. As the transposition occurs in the X chromosome, males and females have to be distinguished from one another. A male-speciﬁc antibody (that recognizes the protein Msl-1, a kind gift from M. Kuroda) was used to distinguish male from female embryos. Only female embryos were analyzed. They2 w scrt6 uf; su(Hw)v/TM6B and y2+;su(Hw)v, cas X/K/TM6B strains were the kind gift of V.

Anterior to the right, dorsal to the top. (d) Ph-GFP is localized to many foci in larval diploid nuclei. (e) Ph-GFP expression under the Pcpromoter in a salivary gland nucleus. Ph-GFP is associated with bands on polytene chromosomes. B: FRAP curves for individual Ph-GFP binding bands in salivary gland nuclei. Individual bands show different recovery rates. C: Model for PcG protein function: PcG silencing complexes (orange) assemble at PRE. Individual PRE have different complex compositions resulting in different binding rates of the assembling proteins and different strengths of silencing.

462 in the imaginal disc and salivary glands in the thirdinstar larvae. Imaging All FISH imaging was carried out on either a Zeiss CLSM 310 or CLSM 510 with a Plan-Apochromat 63 Â NA 1.4 oil immersion objective using simultaneous excitation of Cy5 anti-lamin at 633 nm and emission collected above 665 nm and excitation of Cy3 FISH signals at 514 or 543 nm respectively, emission bandpass 585 nm (HW 30). Image stacks were taken at 0.3 mm intervals (unless otherwise noted) with a pixel resolution of at least 0.1 mm. Pairing frequencies were calculated by visual inspection of the image stacks (results calculated by two different observers did not differ from the means) using Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich) image processing software. Interhomolog distances were calculated from Cartesian coordinates of the centers of FISH signal intensities, using scripts generated in Skilimage (Delft) or in 3D Viewer, a plug-in for Image J generated by R. Heintzmann. Optical sections of ﬁxed whole mount embryos or larval discs were collected by multitrack imaging on the CLM 510 with the Plan-Apochromat 63XNA1.4 oil immersion of H2AvD-GFP (excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm), Cy3 anti-lamin or anti-HP1 (excitation 543 nm, emission 585 nm), and Cy5 anti-lamin (excitation 633, emission above 665 nm). In-vivo timed image stacks of 0.5 mm optical sections on live dechorionated embryos in buffered saline were acquired on a Zeiss CLSM 510 using excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm with a 40 Â 1.2 NA water immersion objective. Timeseries were contrast stretched to compensate for photobleaching. No photodamage was detected since imaged embryos continued to develop normally. A segment of such a series is given as Supplementary Movie. References
