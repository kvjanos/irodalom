Towards nanomicrobiology using atomic force microscopy
Yves F. Dufrêne

Abstract | At the cross-roads of nanoscience and microbiology, the nanoscale analysis of microbial cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an exciting, rapidly evolving research field. Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress in our use of AFM to observe membrane proteins and live cells at high resolution. Remarkable advances have also been made in applying force spectroscopy to manipulate single membrane proteins, to map surface properties and receptor sites on cells and to measure cellular interactions at the single-cell and single-molecule levels. In addition, recent developments in cantilever nanosensors have opened up new avenues for the label-free detection of microorganisms and bioanalytes.

Microbial cell walls fulfil several important functions, such as determining and maintaining cell shape, protecting cells against unfavourable environments, mediating host interactions and biofilm formation, and regulating immune responses1–5. Although the structures and biochemical compositions of microbial cell-wall constituents are generally well-characterized, little is known about the spatial organization, assembly, conformational properties and interactions of the individual components. This is largely due to the fact that traditional methods in microbiology focus on large ensembles of cells or molecules, rather than on single cells and single molecules. In fact, it is well-established that individual microbial cells can differ widely from each other in terms of their genetic composition, physiology, biochemistry and behaviour, and that this variability — or heterogeneity — can have an important impact on various processes, such as antibiotic resistance, fermentation productivity, the efficacy of food preservatives and the potential of pathogens to cause disease6. There is also growing evidence that single cells can show heterogeneous, polar organization7. For example, some bacteria display polar organelles, such as flagella and pili, or lack capsular material at the new poles following cell division. Recent advances in nanotechnology, particularly in atomic force microscopy (AFM)8,9 (BOX 1), have provided new opportunities for studying single cells and single molecules in microbiology9–15. AFM can image membrane proteins and live cells at nanometre resolution directly in buffer solution, which is a key advantage over electron-microscopy techniques. In particular, realtime imaging of single cells provides novel insight into

dynamic structural events, such as structural changes that are caused by growth or drug interactions. As well as structural imaging, the force spectroscopy mode (BOX 1) is increasingly being used to measure the nanoscale chemical and physical properties of cells. Chemical force microscopy (CFM), in which AFM tips are modified with specific functional groups, provides a way to map chemical groups on cell surfaces and measure their interactions. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is now routinely used to probe the unfolding pathways of membrane proteins, the conformational properties of cell-surface polymers and the localization of surface receptors. Here, I discuss recent progress that has been made in the use of AFM to address microbiological questions. Although the primary focus of this article is on single cells, selected examples that deal with membrane proteins are also presented. Specific highlights include the high-resolution imaging of native photosynthetic membranes, the real-time observation of wall remodelling on growing cells, the mapping of cell-surface elasticity, hydrophobicity and receptor sites, the quantitative measurement of cell–cell and cell–solid interactions and the label-free detection of bioanalytes and cells.

Submolecular imaging of membranes Membrane proteins are nanomachineries that fulfil various crucial functions in the cell membrane. AFM is increasingly used to visualize the nanoscale organization of bacterial membrane proteins. The atomic structure of membrane proteins has traditionally been determined using X-ray crystallography 16. Although electron

Box 1 | How does atomic force microscopy work?
In atomic force microscopy (AFM), a sharp tip is scanned over the surface of a sample, which allows so-called near-field physical interactions between the tip and the sample to be sensed and three-dimensional images to be generated. The sample is mounted on a piezoelectric scanner, which ensures three-dimensional positioning with high accuracy. While the tip (or sample) is being scanned in both the x and y directions, the force that interacts between the tip and the specimen is monitored with piconewton sensitivity. This force is measured by deflection of a soft cantilever, which is detected by a laser beam that is focused on the free end of the cantilever and reflected into a photodiode. Different AFM-imaging modes differ mainly in the way that the tip moves over the sample. The most widely used imaging mode is the contact mode, in which sample topography can be measured in two ways: constant height or constant force. In the constant-height mode, cantilever deflection is recorded while the sample is scanned at constant height. However, it is often necessary to minimize large deflections and therefore maintain the applied force to small values to prevent sample damage. This is achieved in the constant-force mode, in which the sample height is adjusted to keep the deflection of the cantilever, and thus the force that is applied to the tip, constant using a feedback loop. In the dynamic or intermittent mode, an oscillating tip is scanned over the surface and the amplitude and phase of the cantilever are monitored near its resonance frequency. In force-spectroscopy modes, such as chemical force microscopy (CFM) and singlemolecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), cantilever deflection is recorded as a function of the vertical displacement of the scanner — that is, the sample is pushed towards the tip and retracted. This results in a cantilever-deflection versus scanner-displacement curve, which can be transformed into a force–distance curve using appropriate corrections. The characteristic adhesion (or unbinding) force between the tip and the sample that is observed during retraction can then be used to map chemical groups (in CFM) and receptor sites (in SMFS). Force curves can be recorded at multiple locations of the x–y plane to yield spatially resolved information on surface properties and receptor sites. In CFM, the tips must be modified with well-defined functional groups to measure interaction forces and chemical properties. Ligands are attached to the tips to detect specific receptors using SMFS.

crystallography and AFM cannot compete with X-ray techniques in terms of resolution, they do allow membrane proteins to be studied in a lipid bilayer and therefore in their native environment. Whereas electron crystallography can resolve the three-dimensional, atomic-scale structure of membrane proteins, AFM can image the surfaces of membrane proteins at subnanometre resolution directly in aqueous solutions. AFM is therefore a complementary tool to X-ray and electroncrystallography techniques in structural biology9,10,16. Following pioneering studies by engel and Müller10,13, Scheuring and colleagues12 pushed the limits of submolecular imaging on native bacterial membranes by providing new insight into the supramolecular architecture of photosynthetic membranes from Rhodopseudomonas species 17,18, Rhodospirillum photometricum 19,20 and Rhodobacter blasticus21. Remarkably, AFM data could explain how the organization of the R. photometricum photosynthetic membrane is modulated in response to light20. High-resolution images revealed two different types of membrane protein assemblies in confined areas, with distinct architectures dividing functional tasks and therefore ensuring optimized photosynthetic activity under high-light and low-light conditions. In addition to imaging, the AFM tip can be used to manipulate and dissect individual membrane proteins. by applying additional loading forces to the imaging tip, stacked S-layer proteins from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Deinococcus radiodurans were

removed to allow access to underlying membranes, and individual protein loops from bacteriorhodopsin and Escherichia coli aquaporins were manipulated22. Notably, SMFS can be used to manipulate individual membrane proteins, thereby providing details of their unfolding pathways and anchoring forces23,24. In early studies, force curves that were recorded for D. radiodurans S layers revealed saw-tooth patterns, with six force peaks that were attributed to the sequential pulling out of multiple protomers of the S layer. After recording the force curve, a molecular defect in the form of a hexameric complex was visualized by high-resolution imaging 23. This approach was also used to unzip the S layer of C. glutamicum, thereby providing new insight into the stability of this protective coat25. Similarly, SMFS was used to examine the folding and assembly of the S layer protein CbsA from Lactobacillus crispatus26. Despite the remarkable capabilities of AFM, its widespread use in membrane research has been limited by the need to firmly attach specimens onto solid supports. To solve this problem, Goncalves et al. 27 developed a novel two-chamber AFM set-up which allows membrane proteins that separate two aqueous compartments to be investigated. This set-up was used to image the inner and outer surfaces of non-supported C. glutamicum membranes at a resolution of ~15Å and to determine the elastic properties and energy of the interaction of the membrane proteins. using this device, microbiologists will be able to couple structural and functional AFM analyses of non-supported bacterial membranes and cell-wall layers. For example, they will be able to observe how ion, pH and solute gradients affect the conformation of channels, pumps and receptors.

Live-cell imaging Microscopes have always been essential tools in microbiology. light microscopy is useful for counting and identifying cells, as well as for determining their general shape, but the resolution is limited to the wavelength of light. electron-microscopy techniques can provide highresolution images of cells28,29. Although powerful, these methods are demanding and require vacuum conditions, which means that live cells cannot be investigated in aqueous solutions. over the past few years, rapid progress has been made in applying AFM imaging to single cells and thereby complementing data obtained with electron microscopy. Microorganisms that have recently been imaged include E. coli30, Bacillus spp.31,32, Clostridium33 spp., Mycobacterium bovis34, Myxococcus xanthus35 and several fungal36–38 and diatom species39,40. Several studies have demonstrated that AFM can be combined with electron microscopy to gain a comprehensive view of cell surfaces33,36,41,42. A recent trend that is receiving increasing attention and that holds promise for the study of cell functions is the use of AFM imaging for assessing the phenotypic characteristics of mutant strains with altered cell-wall constituents30,31,35,36,43,44. For example, the surfaces of

underlying spore coat and undercoat layers, sequentially dissolved until the vegetative cell was released (FIG. 2). AFM imaging is also well-suited to the study of the influence of drugs on microbial cell walls34,45–47. There is currently much interest in wall–drug interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as the biosynthesis of its cell wall is targeted by some of the most powerful anti-tuberculous drugs. In this context, in situ AFM was used to image the surface of mycobacteria before and after incubation with isoniazid, ethionamide, ethambutol or streptomycin34. After drug treatment, the overall integrity of the cells was generally maintained, but major structural alterations were observed in the form of layered structures, striations and porous morphologies. It was suggested that these modifications reflect the inhibition of the synthesis of three major cell-wall constituents: mycolic acids, arabinans and proteins. AFM is therefore a promising tool for investigating the organization and assembly of microbial cell walls and their dynamic changes after cell growth or interaction with drugs. In the future, these nanoscale analyses could have an important impact on drug development, as they may help elucidate the mode of action of novel antibiotics and identify new targets.

wild-type and mutant conidia of the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus were compared44 (FIG. 1). AFM revealed 10-nm-wide rodlets on the wild-type and ∆rodB mutant, but these structures were absent on the ∆rodA and ∆rodA ∆rodB mutants, which had granular surfaces. This provided direct evidence that only rodA is required for rodlet formation. Consistent with AFM data, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry confirmed that the surface of wild-type conidia is protein rich, with large amounts of hydrophobic amino acids, whereas the surface of mutants without rodlets is richer in polysaccharides. Real-time imaging offers new opportunities to probe dynamic events, such as the cell-wall remodelling that is associated with growth and division. A series of highresolution images of the structural dynamics of single, germinating Bacillus atrophaeus spores provides an elegant example of this approach32 (FIG. 2). AFM revealed previously unrecognized germination-induced alterations in spore-coat architecture, as well as the disassembly of outer-spore-coat rodlet structures. The nascent surface of emerging germ cells was revealed to be a porous network of peptidoglycan fibres, similar to the honeycomb structure of peptidoglycan oligomers that was detected by NMR. In a related study, the combined use of ultrathin-section transmission electron microscopy and AFM provided detailed information on the structure of dormant and germinating spores of Clostridium novyi NT33. The spores were shown to be surrounded by an amorphous layer that was intertwined with honeycomb parasporal layers. During germination and outgrowth, the honeycomb layers, as well as the

Functional imaging of live cells Assessing the surface properties of microbial cells at the subcellular level has always been a challenge owing to their small size. However, AFM now provides new possibilities for mapping the elasticity, chemical properties and specific receptors of individual cells.
AFM can probe local cell-wall elasticity. Nanomechanical measurements of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that cell-wall elasticity varies significantly across the cell, with the bud scar being much stiffer than the cell wall owing to the accumulation of chitin48,49. In addition, the cell wall exhibits local temperature-dependent nanomechanical motion49. Gaboriaud et al.50 similarly quantified the nanomechanical properties of Shewanella putrefaciens, and observed that the cell surface swells when the pH is raised, an effect that they attributed to stronger repulsive forces between the cell-surface polymers. CFM can provide insight into nanoscale chemical properties. CFM is a powerful, chemically sensitive imaging technique that can be used to probe chemical groups and their interactions on the nanoscale51 and has recently been used to address microbiological questions34,37,38,52. For example, CFM was used to demonstrate that A. fumigatus conidia are strongly hydrophobic37, a finding that is consistent with the presence of hydrophobic proteins (hydrophobins) in the rodlet layer and that provides direct indications as to the putative functions of these proteins as dispersion and adherence structures. Interestingly, surface hydrophobicity was lower after germination38 and in a mutant without rodlets37, which confirmed that the measured hydrophobic properties were associated with hydrophobins.

provide novel insight into pathogen–host and pathogen– drug interactions53,54. This approach was used to map the distribution of single adhesins on mycobacteria with nanoscale resolution53 (FIG. 3), revealing that the adhesin distribution was concentrated into nanodomains that could promote adhesion to target cells by inducing the recruitment of receptors within membrane rafts. Such single-molecule studies are therefore likely to help us understand the molecular basis of bacterial pathogenicity in the future. In another study, vancomycin-bearing AFM tips were used to detect single d-alanine-d-alanine receptor sites on the septum of live Lactococcus lactis54. This new form of antibiotic probe offers exciting prospects for understanding the mode of action of antibiotics that target cell-wall constituents.

At an early stage of emergence, the cell wall was still partly covered by spore remnants (f), whereas immediately before cell emergence, the cell wall was free of spore integument debris (g).

led to a dramatic decrease of cell-surface hydrophobicity, which was attributed to the removal of the mycolic acid layer34. CFM is therefore a valuable method for resolving the nanoscale chemical properties of microorganisms and observing the effects of cell growth and drug treatment. SMFS can be used to map receptor distribution. SMFS with AFM tips that bear cognate ligands is well-suited for mapping the distribution of receptors, such as celladhesion proteins and antibiotic binding sites, and can

Measuring cellular interactions Molecular interactions have essential roles in the mediation of cellular events, such as cell adhesion and biofilm formation55. There has been considerable recent progress in the use of force spectroscopy to quantify cell–cell and cell–solid interactions14,55. A common method for probing cellular interactions is to directly attach microbial cells to an AFM cantilever and measure the interaction forces towards other cells or solid surfaces. In pioneering work, benoit et al.56 measured the specific adhesion force between two adjacent cells of Dictyostelium discoideum at the single-molecule level. This interaction force could be ascribed to the discrete interaction between two celladhesion glycoproteins that were engaged in cell aggregation. In another early study, lower et al.57 measured the forces between living Shewanella oneidensis bacteria and mineral surfaces. There is substantial interest in the application of cell probes to biomedical issues. For example, emerson and Camesano58 examined the initial adhesion forces of two infectious agents, Candida parapsilosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to biomaterial and biofilm surfaces. More recently, emerson et al.59 explored the influence of the surface properties of solids on the adhesion strength of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a microorganism that is commonly isolated from medical-implant infections. postollec et al. 60 measured the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs, and the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than the non-co-aggregating pair. Cell-surface polymers and appendages have long been recognized for their role in mediating cell adhesion. For the first time, SMFS measurements on microbial cells have enabled researchers to study the adhesion, elasticity and conformational properties of surface polysaccharides and proteins14,61–66. For example, SMFS was used to detect specific force signatures that were characteristic of the bond between a fluorescent chimeric protein on E. coli and a solid surface64. The chimera was composed of a portion of outer-membrane protein A fused to the cyan-fluorescent protein AmCyan. Atabek and Camesano65 provided new insight into the roles of lipopolysaccharides and extracellular polymers on the

unravel each of these pili was unique, a finding that could represent a specific adaptation to the biological niche in which type 1 pili promote bacterial colonization. Combining the power of SMFS with biologically modified AFM tips provides direct access to molecular recognition forces. In microbiology, this approach has been successfully used to measure the specific binding forces between S. epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus and fibronectin70,71; mycobacteria and host receptors53; L. lactis and vancomycin54; and Streptococcus mutans and laminin72 or salivary proteins73. In the future, we anticipate that single-cell and single-molecule force measurements, combined with macroscopic adhesion assays, will be widely used to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of microbial adhesion and biofilm formation.

AFM-based nanosensors over the past decade, arrays of cantilevers74,75 have emerged as a powerful technique for biomedical and biotechnological sensing applications. An important advantage of such AFM-based sensors compared with other sensing methods is that they enable the rapid, ultra-sensitive detection of bioanalytes and cells without any need for labelling or external probes. This is achieved using cantilevers that are functionalized with receptor molecules (for example, antibodies) and incubated with cognate ligands. The resulting specific biomolecular recognition events are detected by monitoring either cantilever bending or the resonance frequency shift. In the cantilever-bending mode, bending of the cantilever is induced upon binding of the ligands, which allows the measurement of picomolar concentrations. Cantilever bending has been successfully applied to the detection of DNA hybridization76, prostate-specific antigens77, cardiac biomarker proteins78 and mRNA markers for cancer progression79. In the resonancefrequency-shift mode, the cantilever is oscillated at its resonance frequency and mass changes on the functionalized cantilever surface are derived from shifts in resonance frequency. Consequently, mass changes can be detected with subpicogram resolution. Nugaeva et al.80,81 demonstrated the power of this sensing mode for microbiology: they used cantilevers that were coated with polyclonal antibodies to detect single Aspergillus niger spores with a sensitivity of 103 colony forming units per ml and could distinguish germinating spores from dormant spores within a few hours. In another study, Bacillus anthracis spores could be specifically detected at low concentrations in the presence of large numbers of Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus spores82. A novel type of nanosensor has recently been reported in which fluid-filled microcantilevers are used to weigh single bacterial cells and sub-monolayers of adsorbed proteins in water with subfemtogram (fg) resolution83 (FIG. 4). The sensor can measure the mass of individual live E. coli (110 fg) and Bacillus subtilis (150 fg) bacteria. In microbiology, the future of these AFM-based nanosensors lies in the development of

Conclusions The studies reviewed here demonstrate how the use of AFM in microbiology has established a strong, new field — nanomicrobiology — that offers fascinating new opportunities in basic and applied research. Compared with other types of microscopy, AFM offers two unique features: the ability to work directly at nanometre (and subnanometre) resolution in aqueous solutions, and the possibility of probing various properties and interactions at the single-molecule level. In the imaging mode, AFM can visualize the architecture of hydrated membrane proteins at subnanometre resolution, thereby complementing X-ray and electron-crystallography techniques. Real-time imaging can be used to track the surface of single live cells while they grow or interact with drugs, which opens up new possibilities for studying the assembly and remodelling of cell walls, and for understanding the action mode of antibiotics. Force spectroscopy provides direct, quantitative information on cell-surface elasticity, chemical properties and receptor distributions, and cellular interactions, which has lead to new insights into the molecular bases of celladhesion events. Cantilever arrays can be used for the rapid, ultra-sensitive detection of bioanalytes and cells without any need for labelling or external probes, and therefore offers new avenues for medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. These sensors could serve as a platform for the detection of pathogens and toxins. This new form of single-cell and single-molecule microbiology will undoubtedly have an important impact on many fields, particularly in biomedical and environmental contexts for elucidating the molecular bases of pathogen–host and microorganism–mineral interactions. Technological challenges that remain to be addressed include the improvement of protocols for attaching biomolecules and cells to AFM cantilevers15 and the development of high-speed AFM instruments84.
