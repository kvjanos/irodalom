Preface
Image processing, analysis and machine vision represent an exciting and dynamic part of cognitive and computer science. Following an explosion of interest during the 1970s, the 1980s and 1990s were characterized by the maturing of the eld and the signi cant growth of active applications; remote sensing, technical diagnostics, autonomous vehicle guidance, medical imaging 2D and 3D and automatic surveillance are the most rapidly developing areas. This progress can be seen in an increasing number of software and hardware products on the market, as well as in a number of digital image processing and machine vision courses o ered at universities worldwide. There are many texts available in the areas we cover|most indeed, all of which we know are referenced somewhere in this book. The subject su ers, however, from a shortage of texts which are `complete' in the sense that they are accessible to the novice, of use to the educated, and up to date. Here we present the second edition of a text rst published in 1993 in which we hope to include many of the very rapid developments that have taken and are still taking place, which quickly age some of the very good textbooks produced over the last two decades or so. The target audience is the undergraduate with negligible experience in the area through to the Master's and research student seeking an advanced springboard in a particular topic. Every section of this text has been updated since the rst version particularly with respect to references; additionally, wholly new sections are presented on: compression via JPEG and MPEG; fractals; fuzzy logic recognition; hidden Markov models; Kalman lters; point distribution models; three-dimensional vision; watershed segmentation; wavelets; and an entire chapter devoted to case studies. Additionally, each chapter now includes a concise Summary section. To help the reader to acquire practical understanding, newly added Exercise sections accompany each chapter; these are in the form of short-answer questions and problems of varying di culty, frequently requiring practical usage of computer tools and or development of application programs. This book re ects the authors' experience in teaching one- and two-semester undergraduate and graduate courses in Digital Image Processing, Digital Image Analysis, Machine Vision, Pattern Recognition, and Intelligent Robotics at their respective institutions. We hope that this combined experience will give a thorough grounding to the beginner and provide material that is advanced enough to allow the more mature student to understand fully the relevant areas of the subject. We acknowledge that in a very short time the more active areas will have moved beyond this text.

xx Preface This book could have been arranged in many ways. It begins with low-level processing and works its way up to higher levels of image interpretation; the authors have chosen this framework because they believe that image understanding originates from a common database of information. The book is formally divided into 16 chapters, beginning with low-level processing and working toward higher-level image representation, although this structure will be less apparent after Chapter 10, when we present transforms, compression, morphology, texture, and motion analysis which are very useful but often special-purpose approaches that may not always be included in the processing chain. The nal chapter presents four live research projects which illustrate in practical use much of what has gone before. Decimal section numbering is used, and equations and gures are numbered within each chapter. Each chapter is accompanied by an extensive list of references and exercises. A selection of algorithms is summarized formally in a manner that should aid implementation|not all the algorithms discussed are presented in this way this might have doubled the length of the book; we have chosen what we regard as the key, or most useful or illustrative, examples for this treatment. Each chapter presents material from an introductory level through to an overview of current work; as such, it is unlikely that the beginner will, at the rst reading, expect to absorb all of a given topic. Often it has been necessary to make reference to material in later chapters and sections, but when this is done an understanding of material in hand will not depend on an understanding of that which comes later. It is expected that the more advanced student will use the book as a reference text and signpost to current activity in the eld|we believe at the time of going to press that the reference list is full in its indication of current directions, but record here our apologies to any work we have overlooked. The serious reader will note that many references are very recent, and should be aware that before long more relevant work will have been published that is not listed here. This is a long book and therefore contains material su cient for much more than one course. Clearly, there are many ways of using it, but for guidance we suggest an ordering that would generate four distinct modules: Digital Image Processing, an undergraduate course. Digital Image Analysis, an undergraduate graduate course, for which Digital Image Processing may be regarded as prerequisite. Computer Vision I, an undergraduate graduate course, for which Digital Image Processing may be regarded as prerequisite. Computer Vision II, a graduate course, for which Computer Vision I may be regarded as prerequisite. The important parts of a course, and necessary prerequisites, will naturally be speci ed locally; a suggestion for partitioning the contents follows this Preface. Assignments should wherever possible make use of existing software; it is our experience that courses of this nature should not be seen as `programming courses', but it is the case that the more direct practical experience the students have of the material discussed, the better is their understanding. Since the rst edition was

Preface xxi published, an explosion of World Wide Web-based material has been made available, permitting many of the exercises we present to be conducted without the necessity of implementing from scratch|we do not present explicit pointers to Web material, since they evolve so quickly; however, pointers to speci c support materials for this book and others may be located via the publisher, http: www.brookscole.com. A The book has been prepared using the L TEX text processing system. Its completion would have been impossible without extensive usage of the Internet computer network and electronic mail. We should like to acknowledge the University of Iowa, the Czech Technical University, and the School of Computer Studies at Leeds University for providing the environment in which this book was prepared. Milan Sonka was a faculty member of the Department of Control Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic for ten years, and is now an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. His research interests include medical image analysis, knowledge-based image analysis, and machine vision. Vaclav Hlavac is an Associate Professor at the Department of Control Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague. His research interests are knowledge-based image analysis and 3D model-based vision. Roger Boyle is a Senior Lecturer in Arti cial Intelligence in the School of Computer Studies at the University of Leeds, England, where his research interests are in low-level vision and pattern recognition. The rst two authors have worked together for some years, and have been co-operating with the third since 1991. The authors have spent many hours in discussions with their teachers, colleagues, and students, from which many improvements to early drafts of this text a resulted. Particular thanks are due to Tom Pajdla, Petr Kodl, Radim Sra at the as Czech Technical University; Steve Collins at the University of Iowa; Jussi Parkkinen at the University of Lappeenranta; Guido Prause at the University of Bremen; David Hogg at the University of Leeds; and many others whose omission from this list does not diminish the value of their contribution. The continuous support and encouragement we received from our wives and families, while inexplicable, was essential to us throughout this project|once again, we promise that our next book will not be written outside standard o ce hours or during holidays but this time we mean it. All authors have contributed throughout|the ordering on the cover corresponds to the weight of individual contribution. Any errors of fact are the joint responsibility of all, while any errors of typography are the responsibility of Roger Boyle. Jointly, they will be glad to incorporate any corrections into future editions.

Course contents
In this section, one possible ordering of the material covered in the four courses proposed in the Preface is given. This coverage should not be considered the only possibility|on the contrary, the possibilities for organizing Image Processing and Analysis courses are practically endless. Therefore, what follows should only be regarded as suggestions, and instructors should tailor course content to t the already acquired knowledge, abilities, and needs of the students enrolled.
