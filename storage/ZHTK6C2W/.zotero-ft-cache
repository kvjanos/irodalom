Motivated group members experience a full sense of choice: of doing what one wants. Such behavior shows high performance, is enjoyable, and enhances innovation. This essay describes principles of building a motivated research group.
Most students begin graduate school or a postdoc full of passion for science. They are given the resources to devote themselves to solving fascinating puzzles. Why is it, then, that in some groups students thrive, can’t wait to come to the lab in the morning, can’t stop thinking about their projects, and feel a sense of personal and intellectual growth, whereas in the lab next door, students after two years are depressed, unmotivated, and, by the end, are loath to even look at their own papers? We all want to work with motivated students and keep ourselves motivated. But how? We are never taught about motivation or about most other essential topics related to the emotional and subjective aspects of being a scientist. A common implicit assumption is that motivation is the sole responsibility of the student: either you have it or you don’t. This can lead researchers to blame group members for their lack of motivation. However, research in psychology has begun to demystify motivation and can offer useful concepts for scientists. The goal is to provide people with the conditions that enhance their natural self-motivated behavior. Here, I discuss simple principles that are useful for building a highly motivated research group. The psychologists Deci and Ryan have, since the 1970s, studied conditions that enable self-determined behavior: behavior that is experienced with a full sense of choice, of doing what one wants, without coercion or compulsion. Such behavior shows high performance, is enjoyable, and enhances innovation. Of many experiments, here is an illustrative example: People are given interesting mechanical puzzles to solve. Group A is given a dollar for solving each puzzle; Group B is not. After 30 min, the researchers tell the groups that the experiment is done. It was found that Group A puts the puzzles down, whereas Group B keeps playing with them on their own time. The surprise was that money and other rewards in these types of tasks apparently act to reduce motivation. What makes people motivated? Deci and Ryan found three conditions for self-determined behavior: competence, autonomy, and social connectedness. I’ll now describe how these concepts are useful in the context of research groups. Competence is a prerequisite for motivation. Peak performance—called ‘‘ﬂow’’ in psychology—is achieved at intermediate difﬁculty of tasks: not too easy and not impossible. To demonstrate how advisers could go wrong, here is a mistake I made with my ﬁrst graduate student. For his ﬁrst project, I suggested that he rewire a commercial ﬂuorimeter to oscillate its temperature control and see how bacterial growth is affected. This seemed reasonable to me coming fully charged from my postdoc, but for him was justiﬁably daunting, as a beginning student who had never even grown bacteria in a test tube. After a short while, I sensed the drop in motivation. We started over: ﬁrst grow bacteria in a test tube. Good. Now do a growth curve. Good. Now do it again and estimate the day-day error. Good. Easy steps allowed positive reinforcement. As his conﬁdence increased, his motivation skyrocketed. The best part is that going slowly allowed us the time to ﬁnd a different and much more interesting project than the one I ﬁrst assigned. I have since been careful to gradually build competence and conﬁdence for new group members, with the help of more experienced members, clearly stating the purpose at each step. In addition to competence, autonomy is essential for motivation. Autonomy is the sense that the project emanates from the person and not from an external source. Using threats or punishment tends to decrease autonomy. One can also decrease autonomy in more subtle ways. One graduate student told me: ‘‘I have a question, but before I tell you, please promise not to solve it immediately by yourself—I want time to think about it.’’ I realized that as experienced scientists, who see several steps ahead, we need to be mindful of sometimes letting students ﬁgure things out for themselves. Autonomy is related to the amount of structure (instructions from the mentor): autonomy is optimal at intermediate structure, between the extremes of micromanagement and neglect. The optimal point is speciﬁc to each individual and changes over time because experienced group members need less structure. You thus need to determine and adjust this point together. The third strand of motivation is social connectedness: having someone in the group care about you and your project. The need for connectedness encompasses the striving to care for others, to feel that others relate to you in mutually supportive ways, and to feel a satisfying involvement with the social world (and the scientiﬁc world) more generally. I make our weekly group meeting an event that enhances social connectedness. The ﬁrst half hour of the two hour meeting is devoted to nonscience. This at ﬁrst may seem to eliminate one quarter of the time for talking science, but in the long term, gains from increased motivation more than make up for any losses. I begin by asking who is not here today, so that we feel a sense of responsibility for each other, contacting people who
