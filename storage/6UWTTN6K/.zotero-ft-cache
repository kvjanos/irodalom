ABSTRACT

We have identified and sequenced the portion of the white locus affected by an idiosyncratic set of white mutant alleles (the wJP alleles). The affected white locus portion (w‘p region) extends from ca. 590 base pairs (bp) to ca. 1270 bp 5’ to the apparent start site for the major white transcription unit. Based on the properties of these mutant alleles, we infer the existence of two distinct cis-acting regulatory elements in the w* region and a third element mapping 3’ to this region (3’ to position ca. -670). Our analysis allows us to define the apparent position of one of the two wSp region elements with substantial precision. Examination of the DNA sequences in this region suggests that it is functionally similar to the enhancers identified in vertebrates. This same element participates in synapsis-dependent genetic interactions, suggesting a largely unexpected relationship between enhancer-like, cis-acting genetic elements and the genetic elements responsible for the synapsisdependent genetic interactions in trans revealed by the existence of transvection effects. Our results further suggest that a presumptive regulatory locus (suppressor-of-whitespotted) regulates white transcription in adult tissues and is not involved in regulating white expression in larvae. We discuss the regulation of white expression in light of our studies. We also demonstrate unusual structures for an X-ray-induced deletion and a spontaneous deletion.

alleles produce a characteristic, drastic reduction in eye pigment deposition. Moreover, the wsp mutations disrupt the synapsis-dependent genetic interactions between synapsed white alleles revealed by the existence of transvection effects (GANS 1953; LEWIS1954; GREEN1959; KAUFMAN, TASAKA SUZUKI and 1973; JACKand JUDD 1979; BABU and BHAT 1980, 1981; BINCHAM1980). Furthermore, in spite of their quite extreme effects on adult eye color phenotype, wSp mutations have no effect on pigmentation of larval malpighian tubules. This is in contrast to essentially all comparably extreme white mutant alleles which exert similar effects on pigmentation in both of these tissues

(LINDSLEY and GRELL1968). This last observation strongly suggests that wsp mutations have tissue-specific effects on white locus expression. Molecular studies (ZACHAR and BINCHAM 1982) revealed several additional novel features of these mutations: First, the four wSpmutations affect the same portion of the locus. Second, the detailed structure of these mutations suggested that they affected a genetic element outside of the white locus transcription unit and, thus, were good candidates for regulatory mutations. and Several recent studies ( O ' H A R E , LEVISand RUBIN 1983; LEVIS, O'HARE RUBIN 1984; PIRROTTAand BROCKL1984; CHAPMAN and BINCHAM 1985) support the original proposal of ZACHAR and BINGHAM (1982) that the wsp mutations map outside of the white transcription unit. Furthermore, CHAPMAN, ZACHAR and BINGHAM (1985) demonstrated the existence of a novel type of suppressor locus (suppessor-of-white-spotted) that interacts specifically with the wsp mutant alleles. Mutant alleles at suppressor-of-white-spotted largely restore a wild-type eye color phenotype to wSp individuals. Thus, the wSp region represents a well-defined opportunity to study presumptive regulatory elements. Moreover, the effects of these mutations on synapsis-dependent genetic interactions at white suggest that these mutations may reveal unexpected properties of such elements. We report here the results of physical, genetic and transcriptional studies of mutations affecting the wsp region of the white locus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Fly strains and culture: Description of fly strains can be found in LINDSLEY GRELL and (1968), in ZACHAR and BINCHAM (1982) and in CHAPMAN and BINCHAM (1985). All files were reared at 2 1.5-22" throghout the developmental stages examined. Control of culture temperature is extremely important in visualizing the effects of su(wsp)on white transcript levels in mature adult tissues. At higher temperatures (greater than 24") the adult effects described are much less extreme (CHAPMAN and BINGHAM 1985; D. DAVISON, CHAPMAN C. and P. BINGHAM, unpublished observations). Adult eye color phenotypes described were assessed within 24-48 h after eclosion. DNA sequence determination: DNA sequences were determined essentially as described by SANCER, NICKLEN and COULSON (1977), SANGER and COULSON (1978) and BARNES, BEVANand SON (1983). A description of the fragments sequenced is in Figure 9. Analysis o DNA sequence similarities: Analysis of nucleotide sequence similarities was performed f in several ways. T h e dot matrix-plotting programs of CONRAD and MOUNT(1982) and PUSTELL and KAFATOS (1984) were used for initial examination of the sequence and for comparison to the BPV enhancer region (WEIHER and BOTCHAN1984) and the SV40 enhancer core sequence (WEIHER,KONIGand GRUSS 1983). T h e GOAD and KANEHISA (1982) implementation of the NEEDLEMAN WUNSCH( 1 970) and SELLERS1 974) (NWS) metric search procedures were then and ( used t o further refine the similarities noted in the dot matrix procedures. Analysis of the direct was performed using the global alignment implemenrepeats in the su(zdp)p region (see RESULTS) tation of the NWS procedures (FITCH and SMITH1983). Statistical analysis w d S performed by the method of GOADand KANEHISA (1982); in particular, equations 4 though 7 were used. For all of these calculations the composition of the entire sequence in Figure 2 was used. T h e expectation (E) value is the average number of times one would expect t o find a match of comparable quality in two randomly chosen sequences of the same length and composition (GOAD and KANEHISA 1982; KANEHISA 1984). For the range of E values calculated below, E values are good approximations of the frequency with which the matches in question should occur at random and we will refer to E values as expected frequencies in the text. T h e expectation values for the alignments in Figure 8 are 0.012 (SV40) and 0.048 (BPV). T h e relevant parameters for all

calculations are given below. The direct repeat in the su(w'p) interval (see DISCUSSION) an E o has f 0.0002. et Although the GOAD and KANEHISA(1982) method has been criticized (LIPMAN al. 1984), we note that the E resulting from the method is an upper bound and, therefore, similarities are likely to be more statistically significant than this calculation indicates. Furthermore, the problem pointed out by LIPMAN al. (1984) occurs at particular, unusual boundary conditions which are not et applicable in the cases presented here. The data for the calculations of Figure 8 are: top, p = 0.228, I = 896 (in this specific case] = I ; W. GOAD, personal communication); bottom, p = 0.252, I = 896, J = 64. For the direct repeats 2 near the su(wq)p region the data are: p = 0.255, 1 = 68, m = 46, r = 18, gl = 6,g = 2, I = I = 896. SIprotection analysis of deletion breakpoints: Approximately 10 pg of Drosophila genomic DNA were mixed with approximately 50 ng of an MIS-cloned fragment (virion DNA) in 100 pl of 10 m Tris, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). The mixture was vortexed vigorously to shear genomic DNA M slightly and then heated to 95" for 5 min. The mixture was immediately chilled on ice, NaCl was added to 0.2 M and the mixture was incubated at 65" for 1 h. After chilling, an equal volume of a solution containing 50 mM sodium acetate and 6 mM zinc sulfate was added to the mixture and followed by the appropriate amount of SI. Digestion was carried out at 37" for 15 min. SI protection products were analyzed by Southern transfer after fractionation on 1% formaldehyde and SAMBROOK 1982). agarose gels (MANIATIS,FRITSCH Northern gel analysis: RNAs were analyzed after Northern transfer (MANIATIS, FRITSCH and SAMBROOK 1982) using the hybridization procedure of Hu and MFSSING (1982) modified by BINGHAM ZACHAR (1985). Purified head tissues and polyadenylated RNAs were prepared as and previously described (BINGHAM ZACHAR 1985). Larvae were washed from food, and polyand adenylated RNAs were prepared as from adult tissues. white locus DNA sequence probes: white locus DNA sequences were originally cloned by BINGHAM, LEVIS and RUBIN (1981). All white cloned segments used herein were derived from these original segments or were retrieved from clone libraries using these sequences as probes (ZACHAR and BINGHAM 1982; LEVIS,BINGHAM RUBIN1982; D. DAVISON, CHAPMAN P. BINGHAM, and C. and unpublished observations).
RESULTS

The wsQregion mutations all affect the same very small region of the white locus: T h e structures of the mutant alleles we have analyzed are diagramed in Figure 1. It is convenient to describe the sequences affected by these mutations in relation to the apparent start site for the major w+ transcript (PIRROTTAand BROCKL 1984; D . DAVISON, C. CHAPMAN P. BINGHAM, unpublished obserand vations). We will assume this start site to be at coordinate ca. +3.7 k b on the standard white locus map (ZACHAR and BINGHAM 1982; LEVIS, BINCHAM and RUBIN 1982). By convention we designate points to the right (5' to the major white transcription unit) of this position as having negative values and points to left as having positive values. [It is important to note that two sources of uncertainty currently exist in placement of the white transcription start site. First, it is inherently difficult to establish that no exons exist 5' to those currently identified (PIRROTTA and BROCKL 1984; Figure 1). We will assume for simplicity that no such undetected exons exist. Moreover, our results (Figures 6 and 7) strongly suggest that the white transcription unit does not extend into the wsp region. Second, we have placed the 5'-most known white exon based on our sequence analysis of the region (identification of potential splice donors and peptide-coding regions, D. DAVISON, unpublished results) and SI protection results (PIRROTTA BROCKL and

FIGURE .-Structures of wspregion mutations and their relation to the major white transcrip1 tion unit. Top, The tive wSpregion mutations discussed in the text are diagramed. The triangle represents the point of insertion of the B104 transposon responsible for the w'p' mutation (ZACHAR and BINCHAM1982; RESULTS). The black bars represent deletions apparently responsible for the other four mutations. The uncertainty in placement of the wsPsand wsp8's5breakpoints is indicated by the white extensions of the black bars. The wqS deletion extends ca. 17 kb rightward from the BglII site shown (ZACHARand BINGHAM 1982); the wSp4deletion extends ca. 1.0 kb rightward from the BglII site (ZACHAR and BINGHAM 1982; Figure 4), and the uIp81d5deletion extends for an undetermined distance beyong a point 5 kb rightward of the BglII site as assessed by Southern gel analysis (results not shown). The single white bar represents our placement of the presumptive first white exon (see text) and the direction of the transcription is shown. This figure is oriented according to the conventional genetic map (left to right is telomere to centromere). All subsequent figures showing sequence data are oriented so that left to right corresponds to the 5' to 3' direction of the white transcription unit. The sequences shown extend from coordinates +588 to -1470 using the coordinate system described in Figure 2 and in the text. Shown in the bottom portion of the figure is the GC composition of the region. Each point represents the GC composition of the 100 bp leftward of the point and there is a point every 10 bp. The GC composition is determined from sequence analysis (Figure 2; D. DAVISON, CHAPMAN C. and P. BINGHAM, unpublished observations).

1984; D. DAVISON, CHAPMAN P. BINGHAM, C. and unpublished observations) rather than on the basis of the sequence of a full-length cDNA clone of the white message. However, although our placement of the presumptive 5'-most exon is inferential, we believe that it is unlikely to be in error by more than 150 bases and is, thus, usefully accurate in this context.] We have sequenced the white locus interval extending from position -473 through - 1369 and that sequence is shown in Figure 2. We have analyzed the mutational lesions responsible for the w s p l ,wsp2and wsp4 mutations by DNA sequence analysis of cloned portions of these alleles (Figures 2-4). We have analyzed the deletion breakpoints for the wSp3and wsp81d5 deficiency mutations by SI protection of cloned DNA segments with genomic DNA (Figure 5). wsP1results from the insertion of the B104 transposon (SCHERER al. 1982) et at position -1170 (Figure 2). wsp2is a spontaneous deficiency mutation whose deleted segment extends from coordinates -1231 to -1 115 (Figures 2 and 3). wsP3 is an X-ray-induced deficiency mutation whose deleted segment begins between coordinates -925 and -870 and extends further 5' for at least 17 kb (Figures 2 and 5). wsP4 is an X-ray-induced deficiency mutation whose deleted segment extends from coordinates ca. -2200 to -1029 (Figures 2 and 4).

FIGURE2.-DNA sequence of the wsp region. Shown is the sequence of the portion of the white locus affected by the dfl region mutations. Shown on the sequence is the insertion point of the B104 transposon responsible for wspl (as assessed by sequencing from right to left on the sequence shown). The zdplallele is indistinguishable in sequence from the Canton-S w+ allele on the interval from the BglII site at coordinate -1019 to the B104 insertion point. We have not sequenced across the w'pl B104 insertion from left to right, and thus, a more complex structure than a simple insertion is not excluded: however, no such structure is indicated by Southern gel analysis (ZACHAR and BINGHAM 1982). O'HARE, LEVISand RUBIN (1983) reportedly sequenced across the UP' insertion in the clone of ZACHAR and BINGHAM(1982) and found the insertion to be simple, although no sequence data were presented. Shown as well are the end points of deleted segments in w* region deficiency mutations. Our estimate of the uncertainty in placement of the wsP3 and wJP81d5 deletion breaks is indicated by the dashed portion of the line. Also shown (highlighted) are the BglII (-1019), PstI (-774), BamHI (-682) and SphI (-473) cleavage sites. Strategy for generation of this sequence shown in Figure 9 and additional details of the wSp2 and zdp4 alleles are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

FIGURE3.-The structure of the dP2 spontaneous deletion mutation. Shown are the sequences immediately surrounding the wrP2deletion in the Canton-S and Oregon-R w+ alleles and in the wsP2 allele. The wsp2deficiency removes bases between coordinates -1231 and -1 115 (Figure 2). The dashed lines indicate the position of the deletion break, and the highlighted Oregon-R sequences are those not removed by the deletion. The italicized bases denote strain-specific base substitution differences between w*' and the Canton-S w+ allele. These differences are shared by w+" and the Oregon-R w+ allele and are thus unlikely to be responsible for the zdP2mutant phenotype. On the interval for which fully reliable sequence data are available for all alleles (between coordinates -1269 and -1080; Figure 2) the wsp2allele differs from the Canton-S allele at one other point; between coordinates - 1092 and - 1085 the wSp2 sequence is GTCGGTAG and the Canton3 and Oregon-R w+ sequences are GTCACTAG. We note that these last base substitution differences between zdP2and the two wild-type alleles map 83 bases 3 to the wq' insertion, whereas the wJp2 ' deletion covers the wspl insertion site. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that the base substitution differences between w'p' and the Canton-S w+ allele represent strain-specific differences present in the wild-type allele parental to w** and that the w"p2 deletion is solely responsible for the mutant phenotype. The strategy for generating the sequence is described in Figure 9.

This sequence feature might have been generated during repair of X-ray-induced damage. Other than the changes shown in the figure, UP' is indistinguishable from the Canton4 w+ sequence (Figure 2) on the interval for which reliable sequence is available (extending from the Bglll cleavage site at approximately coordinate -2220 through coordinate -992; Figures I , 2 and 9).

T h e wSP8Id5 mutation arose after EMS mutagenesis and produces an eye color phenotype very much more darkly pigmented than the wsP phenotype (M. M. GREEN,personal communication). We find that this mutation behaves as a spotted allele by conventional genetic tests (GREEN1959): It produces a spotted-like eye color when heterozygous with wsp’ and it is a dominant suppressor of the 2’ mutation allele at zeste. is We find that wSp8ld5 a deficiency mutation whose deleted segment begins between coordinates -670 and -590 and extends for an uncharacterized distance beyond a point 5 kb 5’ to the white transcription unit (Figures 2 and 5 and results not shown). It is convenient to define two generic allele designations. T h e first is wsP mutations or wsp alleles referring exclusively to W‘P’, wsp2,wsp3 and wsP4. (We will refer to the presumptive genetic element inactivated by the wsP mutations as the wSp genetic element.) T h e second is wsP region mutations referring, mutation. collectively, to the wsp mutations and the wsp81d5 The sequence o the wsp genetic element suggests that it is enhancer-like: T h e f apparent stage or tissue specificity of wSpmutant effects on white expression (LINDSLEY GRELL1968 and references therein; introduction) and the poand sition of the wsp genetic element outside of the major white transcription unit (Figure 1 ; introduction) suggests that the element exerts positive effects on white expression from ca. 1000 bp outside the transcription unit. These properties are suggestive of elements similar to the enhancers identified in verteKONIG and GRUSS1983; WEIHERand BOTCHAN 1984 brate systems (WEIHER, and references therein). ~ We have examined the sequenced interval containing the w ” genetic element (-1 369 to -473) for similarities to the following portions of well-characterized vertebrate enhancers: base pairs 5021 through 5291 on the polyoma map (TOOZE1981), base pairs 179 through 270 on the SV40 map (TOOZE,1981) and base pairs 4391 through 4454 on the BPV map (WEIHERand BOTCHAN 1984). These studies reveal statistically significant similarities to the functional region (Figure 8). Moreportions of the BPV and SV40 enhancers in the dp over, these regions of similarity are partially coextensive with one another and map to the small white locus region containing the wSpgenetic element (-1215 to -1240; Figures 1 and 8). These results are suggestive and we propose that the w5P element is functionally related to these papovavirus enhancers. The wSP81d5 deletion dejnes one of the sites o suppressor-of-white-spotted locus f action on the white locus: white transcript levels in mature adult tissues are substantially reduced in the presence of the wild-type allele at a second locus, and 1985; Figures 6 suppressor-of-white-spotted [su(w”P)](CHAPMAN BINGHAM and 7). On the basis of these results, these authors speculated that the wildtype su(w“p) locus causes the production of a repressor of white transcription. [For simplicity, we will refer to this hypothetical repressor as the su(wSp)repressor.] On this hypothesis, the suppressor mutation inactivates this repressor leading to the observed elevated white transcript levels. If this hypothesis is correct, it should be possible to mimic the effects of mutant alleles at su(w”P) on expression of wsp alleles by removing the white locus site on which the su(w”P) repressor acts. With this prediction in mind we

Shown are the results of Northern gel analysis of polyadenylated RNAs ( I 0 rglchannel) isolated from purified adult head tisues. The genotypes analyzed are as follows by channel number: 1, w+; 2, w”’; 3. su(w”) w”’; 4. w”*; 5. su(w”) w”*; 6 and 8, w”’; 7 and 9. su(w”) w”’; IO, su(w”) UPp; 11, W.*;12, @ I d 5 ; 13, su(w”) @ I d 3 . The figure shown was generated by cutting a Northern transfer in half, probing the top half with white sequences and the bottom half with rp49 sequences. The white locus probe is a mixture of fragments extending from coordinates -1.2 to -0.4 kg and from +3.2 to +6.5 kb on the standard white locus map. The rp49 probe is the 0.6-kb EcoR1 + Hind111 fragment containing most of the rp49 transcription unit (O’CONNELL ROSBASH and 1984). The ratio of rp49 to white transcripts is generally reproducible for any tissue and genotype. and rp49 RNA constitutes an internal control for the amounts of polyadenylated RNA loaded into each channel. The UPp allele produces a transcript indistinguishable in size, hybridiration pattern and levels from w* alleles. white transcript levels in whole adults and in adult body tissues of w”’.’ and UPp show an essentially identical pattern of response to su(w“); white transcript levels in these other tissues are likewise unaffected by the w” mutations (results not shown). We note that the small depression in white transcript levels seen in channels 4 and 8 are within the fluctuations normally seen and are not reproducible (for example, compare channels 6 and 8 which both contain UP’ RNA). Also, note that the w” alleles produce a wild-type transcript in normal amounts in mature adult tissues and w‘* produces a wild-type white regulatory region; we presume, therefore, that mature adult transcript levels produced by w+ alleles will respond to the allelic state of su(w”) in the same way as do w” and UP* alleles.

noted that the eye color phenotypes produced by the su(wsp)1wsP1-3 double mutant combinations were quite strikingly similar to those produced by the Wsp81d5 mutation alone. These eye color phenotypes are both readilv distinguishable from either the wild-type phenotype o r any white mutant phenotype we have examined. This observation and the structures of the wsP region mutations deficiency (which deletes the wsP genetic elesuggested to us that the wsp8Id5 ment) might also delete the site of action of the presumptive su(wsP) repressor. This hypothesis, in turn, is directly testable. First, it predicts that the eye color phenotype produced by wspUld5 should not be altered by replacing the wild-type allele at su(wsp)with a mutant allele, in spite of the fact that the wspU I d 5 deletion removes the wsp genetic element. This is shown to be the case (wdef by the following results: wsp81d5/wdcf is a white deficiency allele deleting sequences from coordinates +10 to -15 kb on the standard white locus map; Z. ZACHARand P. BINGHAM, unpublished observations) heterozygous females ~ p homozygous females o r~ wSP8ld5/ ~ ~ ~ / have much less eye pigment than ~ Y hemizygous males. This demonstrates that the wsp81d5 color phenotype is eye sensitive to two-fold differences in dosage of the wSP8ld5 allele or, equivalently, that a two-fold increase in wspald5 expression in eye pigment cells of wspUld5/wdef females would be readily detected. su(wsp)has been shown previously to produce an increase of at least two-fold on eye pigment produced by the w*f alleles ZACHAR and BINCHAM 198.5), and w ~ P ~ individuals w show~ an ~ ~ ~ / ~ (CHAPMAN, eye color phenotype quite similar to wSP/wspindividuals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that effects of su(wsp) on wSp8ld5 similar in magnitude to its individuals. Such an effects on w’P‘-~ should be readily discernible in wSP8ld5/wdef effect is demonstrated not to occur by the fact that wsp81d5/wdef all of the of following genotypes are indistinguishable from one another: su(wsp)+/su(wsp)+, su(wsP)+/su(wsP) and su(wsP)/su(wsp). (Notive also that these experiments demallele dosage compensates.) onstrate that the w~~~~~~ eye T h e question arises as to whether su(wsp)might increase wSP8ld5 pigmentation by the same absolute amount (rather than by the same factor) as it does in the case of the wsp alleles without this increase being discernible in the experiment described in the preceding paragraph. This possibility must be considered because wsf’81d5 produces a higher level of eye pigmentation than do w’P’-~. The following experiment demonstrates that this is unlikely: su(wsp) Wsp81d5 /su(wSP)wsP1 females have noticeably more pigmented eyes than do the corresponding homozygous su(wsp)+females. This increased pigmentation presumably results from su(wsf’)action on wspl in this heterozygote. The nonresponsiveness of wSPsld5to su(wsp) is further corroborated by our observation that the eye color phenotype of wsp81d5homozygous females is unaffected by the su(wsp)mutation in either heterozygous or homozygous condition. These experiments demonstrate that the eye color phenotype produced by wsP81d5does not respond to su(wsp), in contrast to all of the other wSp region mutations. This and the eye color phenotype of wSP8ld5are strong evidence that it deletes the white locus element necessary to allow response to the su(wsp) locus during the deposition of adult eye pigment in pupal development. On the one hand, deposition of eye pigment occurs during pupal develop-

ment. On the other hand, white transcripts detected in adult heads may or may not be synthesized during those times or in those tissues where eye pigment is being deposited. We, thus, wished to ask whether the mature adult transcript levels produced by the wSP81d5 allele would be nonresponsive to su(wd) as is eye pigment deposition. The results in Figure 6 show that wSp81d5 transcript levels respond to su(wSp)precisely as do other tested white alleles. Collectively, our results suggest that the su(wsp) locus acts on one white locus site during eye pigment deposition and a second during deposition of white transcripts in mature adult tissues. We note that studies of the wDzLallele at white also suggest that the eye pigment and head transcript phenotypes are separately controlled (BINGHAM ZACHAR 1985). We will refer to the white and locus element allowing su(wsp) responsiveness during pigment deposition as the su(wSP)genetic element. This element resides partially or entirely between the deletions. The observation that left-hand breakpoints of the wSp3 and wSpRld5 both wsP3 and wsP81d5 deletions extend for substantial distances rightward (5’) suggests that the white locus element allowing responsiveness of mature adult deletion. white transcript levels to su(wSP)maps leftward (3’) to the w~~~~~~ We note that our analysis of the sequence from -1024 to -473 revealed the existence of two small regions with extensive homology to one another (MATERIALS AND METHODS). These regions extend from -895 to -815 and from -964 to -896 and are ca. 62% homologous to one another. By the measure described in MATERIALS AND METHODS a match of this quality is expected to occur in approximately 0.02% of randomly chosen comparable sequences. Moreover, 24 Monte Carlo scramblings of the sequence preserving nearest neighbor frequencies did not result in comparably extensive sequence repetitions. These observations allow the hypothesis that this imperfect, direct repetition is maintained by selection, although alternatives to this supposition are not excluded. wsP region mutations and the su(wsP)mutation have no effects on white transcript levels in larvae: Neither the wSp’ insertion mutation (PIRROTTA and BROCKL 1984; LEVIS,O’HAREand RUBIN, 1984; CHAPMAN, ZACHAR and BINGHAM 1985; Figure 6) nor the wsPregion deletion mutations (CHAPMAN, ZACHARand BINGHAM 1985; Figure 6) have a discernable effect on white transcript levels in mature adult tissues. Moreover, it has also been observed previously that tne su(wsp) mutation causes a substantial elevation in white transcript levels in mature adult tissues (CHAPMAN BINGHAM and 1985). We, therefore, wished to ask whether these mutations affected larval white transcript levels. Figure 7 shows that wsp2,wsp3and wsPald5 fail to have detectable effects on accumuall lation of white transcripts at the larval stige examined. Moreover, the su(wSp) mutation has no effect on larval white transcript levels in any cases that we have examined. This last observation suggests that the su(wsP) locus may act exclusively in regulating white expression in adults. On the nature of spontanPous and X-ray-induced deletion formation: The wsP2 deficiency probably arose spontaneously in the recombination-proficient female germline (MOHLER 1956). Our sequence data show that the segment deleted in this event is bounded by a TGTGTG segment on one side and a single T G

FIGURE 8.-Similarities between the region and the SV40 and BPV enhancer regions. Sequence matches shown are between the region of the Canton-S w+ allele (coordinates -1248 to -1221; Figure 2) and the SV40 enhancer (top portion) or the BPV enhancer (bottom portion). (See text for detailed discussion of these sequence matches). These regions of similarity overlap. This region of overlap abuts the small segment deleted in the wrp2mutation and is deleted in the w"P3 and uP4alleles (Figures 1 and 2). Moreover, this region is 5' to the uP' insertion and is thus separated from the white transcription unit by this insertion (Figures 1 and 2). One expects to encounter matches of comparable quality between randomly chosen, comparable sequences at frequencies of approximately 0.0 12 (SV40) and 0.048 (BPV), respectively (MATERIALS AND METHODS). Note that the similarities of these enhancer sequences to the Oregon-R w+ allele are less extensive than those to the Canton-S w+ allele (compare Figures 3 and 8).

on the other. These are combined to form a TGTGTGTG segment in the deletion allele (Figure 2). Evidence exists that such poly-TG segments participate in some recombination events (PROUDFOOT MANIATIS 1980; SLIGHand TOM, BLECHL and SMITHIES1980; STRINGER 1982; D. TRECO N. ARNHEIM, and personal communication). dP4 an X-ray-induced deficiency, and o u r sequence data show the presence is of 27 bp of additional sequence (not present in any other white allele we have examined) at the deletion breakpoint (Figure 4). This additional 27 bp consists of three copies of the sequence PCCAYTTT, where P is a purine and Y is pyrimidine. T w o copies of this sequence are present in the wild-type allele and precisely abut one of the deletion breakpoints (Figure 4). This unusual structure suggests that the repair of X-ray-induced damage may be unexpectedly complex. GC content o the wsp region: Our DNA sequence analysis of the wsp region f shows the existence of very large variation in GC content (Figures 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9). Sequence analysis of several other Drosophila genes (O'CONNELL and 1984; SNYDER al. 1982; BENYAJATI al. 1983; MUSKAVITCHand et et ROSBASH HOGNESS 1982; MCGINNIS al. 1983) suggests that relatively high GC content et correlates with regions whose sequences are under selective constraint.
DISCUSSION

A refned model for regulation of white transcription in adult tissues: Our results suggest that the wsp region is internally complex. It apparently contains at least two distinct genetic elements: First, mapping partially or entirely in the interval between positions -1231 to -1 115 is the wsp genetic element. All analyzed mutants eliminating only this region drastically reduce white-dependent eye pigmentation. Second, mapping partially or entirely between positions -590 and -925 is a presumptive genetic element [su(w'~)pelement] necessary to

allow responsiveness of wsp allele-dependent eye pigment deposition to the allelic state of the su(wsP) locus. Third, our studies suggest a genetic element allowing the accumulation of white transcripts in mature adult tissues to be responsive to the allelic state of the su(wsp)locus. This element is not deleted by any of the mutations analyzed, including wSP8ld5,and, thus, presumably maps 3’ to position -670. We propose the following model for the regulation of white expression in adult tissues on the basis of our studies: A repressor of white transcription is produced in mature and immature adult tissues. Production of this repressor is dependent on a wild-type allele at the suppressor-of-white-spotted locus. This repressor acts at a white locus site during eye pigment deposition (developing, immature adult tissue) different from during deposition of white transcripts in mature adult tissues. In inmature eye pigment cells, the effect of this repressor is entirely antagonized by the action of the enhancer-like wsP genetic element. Genetic evidence (GREEN1959; BABUand BHAT 1980) suggests that the product of the zeste locus participates in this action of the wSp genetic element. The enhancer-like wsP element has no discernible effect on white transcript levels in mature adult tissues. We also note that the wSP8Id5allele dosage compensates. This observation, together with earlier observations (GREEN1959; JUDD 1974; LEVIS, BINGHAM and RUBIN 1982; ZACHAR and BINGHAM1982; HAZELRIGG, LEVISand RUBIN 1984), demonstrates that the element necessary to allow dosage compensation in adult eye pigment cells maps between coordinates -3.0 and +4.1 kb on the white locus map. Synapsis-dependent interactions and cis-acting regulatory elements: We wish to emphasize an important implication of the proposal that the wsP element is an enhancer (RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS above): On the one hand, the wsP element participates in the special, genetically defined interactions that occur between two white alleles when the two alleles pair or synapse (GREEN1959; JACK and JUDD 1979; BINGHAM 1980; BABUand BHAT 1980). The mechanistic basis of this class of interactions is still obscure, but such interactions have been clearly recognized at several loci in Drosophila and may be relatively common (LEWIS 1954; GELBART and Wu 1982; BINGHAM and ZACHAR 1985). On the other hand, the wide occurrence of enhancer-like elements in vertebrates is well established, but the mechanisms whereby these elements act from distances of hundreds to thousands of base pairs to stimulate transcript accumulation is likewise not established. The proposal that the wsp element is an enhancer suggests an insight into both of these unresolved problems. This insight results from the fact that one mechanism previously proposed for synapsis-dependent interactions in Drosophila is quite similar to a mechanism previously proposed for the action of enhancers. On the one hand, it has and been proposed (BINGHAM ZACHAR 1985) that synapsis-dependent interactions reflect the propensity of synapsed alleles to behave as a unit in choosing nuclear positions or compartments relevant to the expression of those alleles. Although the evidence for this hypothesis is circumstantial, it is suggestive. On the other hand, it has been proposed that enhancer-like cis-acting regulatory

elements might act by controlling nuclear placement of associated genes [see MIRKOVITCH,MIRAULTand LAEMMLI (1984) for a recent discussion], although the evidence for this proposal is likewise circumstantial. We suggest that our observation of possible identity between an element participating in synapsisdependent interactions and a presumptive enhancer supports each of these very similar mechanistic hypotheses.
