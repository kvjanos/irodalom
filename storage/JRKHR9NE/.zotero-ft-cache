Coffee Break with Exhibit and Poster Viewing IMAGE ANALYSIS 10:30-10:35 Chairperson’s Opening Remarks 10:35-11:00 Quantifying Challenging Phenotypes in Images
Mark-Anthony Bray, Ph.D., Computational Biologist, Imaging Platform, Broad Institute Many challenging image-based phenotypes have recently become quantifiable due to advances in image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our recent work in the area has enabled high-content analysis of phenotypes relevant to multiple basic biological processes and clinically relevant diseases. For example, our recent work has enabled screens of phenotypes in physiologically relevant co-culture systems, where cell types with diverse morphologies are present in each sample. The variety of phenotypes that can be accurately quantified using software continues to grow.

HCA OF STEM CELLS 10:30-10:35 Chairperson’s Opening Remarks 10:35-11:00 High-Content Imaging in Oncology Discovery: Identification and Characterization of Novel Targets in Cancer Stem Cells
Jonathan Low, Ph.D., Post-Doctoral Scientist, Cancer Cell Growth and Survival, Lilly Corporate Center Although the cycling of eukaryotic cells has long been a primary focus for cancer therapeutics, recent advances in imaging and data analysis allow even further definition of cellular events as they occur in individual cells and cellular subpopulations in response to treatment. High-content imaging (HCI) has been an effective tool to elucidate cellular responses to a variety of agents, however, these data were most frequently observed as averages of the entire captured population, unnecessarily decreasing the resolution of each assay. Here we dissect the eukaryotic cellular subpopulations in response to treatment using HCI in conjunction with unsupervised K means clustering. We first generate distinct phenotypic fingerprints for each major cell cycle and mitotic compartment and use those fingerprints to characterize chemotherapeutic agents. We determine that the cell cycle arrest phenotypes caused by these agents are similar to, though distinct from, those found in untreated cells both in vitro and in vivo, and that these distinctions frequently suggest the mechanism of action. Further, we demonstrate the power of this technique to identify novel targets and detect the differential effects of target knockdown on cancer stem cells through the use of shRNA libraries. High-content data are then integrated with additional discovery tools to link phenotypic changes with cellular pathways. HCI analysis of imaging data, obtained from individual cells under all of these research conditions, grouped into cellular subpopulations, and multiplexed with additional tools represents a powerful method to discern both cellular events and treatment effects.

FLOW CYTOMETRY 10:30-10:35 Chairperson’s Opening Remarks 10:35-11:00 Implications of HighThroughput Flow Cytometry on Drug Discovery
J. Paul Robinson, Ph.D., SVM, Professor, Cytomics & Deputy Director, Bindley Bioscience Center, Cytomics & Imaging, Purdue University The time has come for high-content tools such as flow cytometry to also move into the highthroughput domain. This requires both hardware and software changes. It is not easy to move a technology that has a 40-year history of operating under the same conditions, to change its basic operational rationale. However, that is happening. One of the major changes is the radical change in analytical tools becoming available. This presentation will outline these recent tool-sets that will transform the field of flow cytometry.

11:00-11:25 Quantitative Analysis of High-Content Screens: How Can Machine Intelligence Help?
Peter Horvath, Ph.D., Image Processing Scientist, Light Microscopy Centre, ETH Zurich Accurate quantitative analysis is essential for high-content screens. We will show cell-based classification with machine learning techniques. A novel semi-supervised learning-based method will be presented to speed up the learning process with orders of magnitude. Finally, we will present new machine intelligence methods for accurate quality control.

11:00-11:25 Phospho Flow Cytometry in Drug Discovery: From Screening to Clinical Trials
Peter Krutzik, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, Baxter Lab in Genetics Pharmacology, Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for analyzing 10 or more parameters at the single cell level. Recently, the use of phospho-specific antibodies has allowed us to measure intracellular signaling events in addition to classical surface markers. This enables us to analyze kinase signaling cascades in complex primary cell populations such	as	human	peripheral	blood.	Using	phospho flow, we performed a small molecule drug screen	in	primary	cells,	in	both	96	and	384	well	 format, to search for inhibitors of immunological pathways. The screen yielded pathway- and novel cell type-specific inhibitors of cytokine-induced type-specific inhibitors of cytokine-induced JakStat signaling. The method was used both in vitro and in vivo to confirm drug activity. To improve sample throughput, we employed Fluorescent Cell Barcoding (FCB), a multiplexing method that enables combination of samples prior to antibody staining. We will also discuss preliminary work in automating the phospho flow method for large scale screening projects.

11:25-11:50 Application of Pattern Recognition to Image-Based Small Molecule Screening Data for Phenotypic Analysis
John McLaughlin, Ph.D., Scientist & Manager, Biology, Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This presentation will describe an image based phenotypic screen for AuroraB Kinase inhibitors that we have developed, which lead to the discovery and subsequent development of a small molecule	R763/AS703569	currently	in	clinical	 trials for cancer. This screen is a proliferation type

11:00-11:25 Characteristics and Re-Programming of Breast Cancer Stem Cells
Fredika M. Robertson, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Experimental Therapeutics; Director, Translational Research, The Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Very aggressive tumor types contain a high percentage of cells defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs) with characteristics similar to those of embryonic stem cells including a slow turnover time that can be imaged and quantitated by their retention of the nucleoside analog ethynyl deoxyuridine	(EDU).	CSCs	form	3-dimensional	 (3D) tumor spheroids that differentially express specific surface markers including stage specific embryonic antigens 1 and 4 (SSEA1/4), CD133, and CD44+/CD24-/low. CSCs have characteristic patterns of gene expression of molecules in signaling pathways that regulate survival, selfrenewal, pleuripotency, and multi-drug resistance. Agents that can either stimulate the normally quiescent CSCs to re-enter the cell cycle or agents that target transcription factors regulating self renewal and survival result in re-programming CSCs for their elimination. The effects of exposure to these agents that can re-program activities of CSCs will be discussed in the context of image-based analysis. assay in which cancer cell lines are treated with small molecules for 48hrs then fixed and stained for the presence of DNA and Actin. We create training sets from treatments with control compounds and use them to create support vector machine classifiers that are subsequently used to mine our data for interesting phenotypes in addition to AuroraB. Our large annotated data set with many well-characterized controls has provided an excellent opportunity to validate and improve the predictive capabilities of the classifiers. Various strategies for increasing training set robustness have demonstrated an impressive ability to productively mine screening data collected on a weekly basis over many years. We have found that pattern recognition can significantly enhance and speed attempts to quantify what are often overwhelmingly large and complex image data sets produced by image-based screening.

11:25-11:50 High-Content HighThroughput Flow Cytometry for Small Molecule Discovery
Eric Prossnitz, Ph.D., Professor, Cell Biology and Physiology, University of New Mexico The	University	of	New	Mexico	Center	for	Molecule Discovery continues to innovate in the application of the HyperCyt flow cytometry platform for high-content high throughput small molecule discovery.	The	platform	is	evolving	for	1536	well	 plates and direct sample delivery. Recently, we have demonstrated HTS applications with primary cells and yeast multiplex model systems for TOR pathway analysis, as well as innovative molecular assays for intracellular trafficking pathways. The flow cytometry platform is well-suited to fill a unique niche in small molecule identification for cell and molecular assays in suspension, especially in complex cell suspensions for primary cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and leukemia.

11:50-12:15 High-Performance Image Analysis for High-Content Screening
Dadong Wang, Ph.D., Stream Leader, Biotech Imaging, CSIRO Large image datasets and fast turnaround requirements have made efficient High Content Screening (HCS) a challenging task. With the enormous progress in high performance computing, computers	with	multi-core	CPUs	have	become	 standard	and	GPUs	are	being	used	more	widely	 in data and compute-intensive environments. This talk will report some of our studies in high performance image.

11:50-12:15 SERS Cytometry for High Content Analysis: More Parameters for Less
John P Nolan, Ph.D., Professor, La Jolla . Bioengineering Institute Fluorescence methods dominate the field of cytometry, providing sensitive and quantitative measurements of molecules, cells, and other particles. In flow cytometry especially, multiple light sources, filters and detectors enable as many as 20 different fluorescence probes to be detected and measured simultaneously and rapidly on individual cells. However, this requires the use of multiple lasers and fluorophores with emission spectra that fill the optical spectrum from the	UV	to	the	near	IR,	and	significant	increases	 in this number are unlikely with existing light sources, fluorophores, and detectors. To make more efficient use of this spectral range, we have developed instruments and probes that take advantage of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SERS occurs at the surface of metal nanoparticles and offers sensitivity comparable to fluorescence, but with much more efficient use of the optical spectrum, providing the potential of hundreds of tags to be resolved with a single laser line and less than 100 nm of spectral space. We use nanoparticle probes with distinctive SERS spectra functionalized with antibodies or other targeting molecules to measure multiple targets simultaneously. Raman flow cytometers use spectrographs and array detectors to measure high resolution SERS spectra from hundreds of individual particles per second. Simultaneous Raman and fluorescence flow cytometry provide the best of both worlds, with fluorescence measurements of both functionally and antigenic markers combined with very highly multiparameter measurements of antigens or other targets.

11:55-12:20 A Chemical Approach to Controlling Stem Cell Fate
Sheng Ding, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Chemistry, Scripps Research Institute Recent advances in stem cell biology may make possible new approaches for the treatment of a number of diseases. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms that control stem cell fate as well as an improved ability to manipulate them are required. Toward these goals, we have developed and implemented high throughput cell-based phenotypic screens of arrayed chemical and gene libraries to identify and further characterize small molecules and genes that can control stem cell fate in various systems. This talk will provide latest examples of discovery efforts in my lab that have advanced our ability and understanding toward controlling stem cell fate, including self-renewal, survival, differentiation and reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells.

Part 1: Setting up the HCA Lab

Kurt Scudder, Ph.D., Solution Scientist, Accelrys Accelrys’ Pipeline Pilot has found a place in the labs of many HCA practitioners, taking advantage of the image analysis, statistics, and plate data handling collections in the product. The toolbox approach allows developers and users to envision a way to analyze or visualize data, then rapidly construct one or more protocols to enable that vision. This approach complements and extends the HCS instrument vendors’ data management and analysis software. Accelrys has facilitated this by building into Pipeline Pilot connectivity to the data management systems from most major HCA vendors such as	Cellomics,	GE	Healthcare,	BD	Bioscience,	PE,	Molecular	Devices,	and	 Beckman-Coulter. This capability can now be combined with the learning and advanced data modeling capabilities in Pipeline Pilot to move beyond simple HCS analysis and data management into more detailed examination of images and extracted data, and examination of the data for latent patterns or characteristics which can give new insights. All of this can be done while remaining within the Pipeline Pilot environment. Examples of the application of advanced data modeling with images and image objects will be presented.

Stephan Heyse, Ph.D., Head, Genedata Screener, Genedata AG High-content screening experiments produce rich information on phenotypic changes of individual cells when subjected to treatment with compounds, siRNAs, or other inducers. While the management of the resulting microscope images is the current concern, upcoming challenges are the biologically meaningful representation and quantification of HCS outcomes. This includes distinguishing cell sub-populations of differential response, statistically aggregating them across wells and replicates, normalizing signals and eliminating errors, separating and quantifying phenotypes and effects. Leveraging this information from the complex single-cell data sets, with millions of data points per plate, requires a scalable framework with automated data processing and intelligent management functions, including scientists’ review at any stage of the process. Taking examples from large siRNA and compound screens, we show how such systematic in-depth analysis of high content screens can be accomplished routinely, passing from single-cell data to hit selection in a highly efficient workflow.

HCA FOR COMPOUND SCREENING 2:15-2:40 Whole Library Screen by Utilizing Fully Automated High-Content Analysis Approach
Stefan Prechtl, Ph.D., Team Leader, High-Content Analysis, Bayer Schering Pharma AG HCA technology has extended the ability of researchers to identify and quantify compound effects on a number of cellular events allowing the rapid screening of chemical libraries. The recent developments have enabled scientists to analyze intracellular signaling pathways and physiologically relevant events using fully automated approaches. In this way, High-Content Screening represents drug screening in a more appropriate physiologically context. Here, we present data from our whole library screen that we have performed with optimally selected HCA tools providing a reliable environment to perform a primary Ultra-HCS	campaign.	

DATA ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT 2:15-2:40 Patches and Batches: New Approaches to Analyzing Drug Effects on Subcellular Patterns
Robert F Murphy, Ph.D., Professor, Departments . of Biological Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University A critical task that is addressed by high-content screening and analysis is learning the effects of compounds (e.g., drug candidates) on the localization of targets (e.g., proteins). This is usually performed by exhaustive analysis of many compounds on one protein, a process that is repeated for the next drug. I will describe methods for learning the dependency of many proteins on many compounds without such exhaustive analysis.

LIVE-CELL IMAGING 2:15-2:40 Quantitative 4D LiveCell Imaging Reveals Regulation of Kinetochore Alignment within the Metaphase Plate
Jason Swedlow, Ph.D., Senior Research Fellow & Reader, Gene Regulation & Expression, University of Dundee A hallmark of mitosis in most eukaryotic cells is the formation of a metaphase plate half-way between the spindle poles, about which chromosomes exhibit oscillatory movements. These movements are accompanied by changes in the distance between sister kinetochores, commonly referred to as ‘breathing’. The relationships between oscillations, breathing, and formation of the metaphase plate, and the molecular components that regulate these processes, are poorly understood. We developed a four-dimensional imaging assay combined with computational image analysis that identifies and tracks sister kinetochores over time, classifies kinetochores as aligned or unaligned, and determines the mitotic phase of the cell. Our assay shows that late prometaphase and metaphase oscillation and breathing speeds are most sensitive to depletion of microtubule depolymerases, while oscillation and breathing periods are most sensitive to perturbations that alter the stiffness of the mechanical linkage between sisters. It also reveals that metaphase plates become thinner as cells progress towards anaphase, due to a progressive reduction in oscillation speed at constant oscillation period.

2:40-3:10 Phenotypic High-Content Screens Utilizing Multi-Parametric Data Analysis for Novel Lead Identification
Daniela Gabriel, Ph.D., Associate Director, Lead Finding Platform, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research High-content screening (HCS) applications allow the characterization of novel compounds in a cellular	environment.		Generally	compound	dependent effects are analyzed with regard to target specificity whereas a great potential of HCS is the analysis of cellular phenotypes by generation of multidimensional readouts of cellular effects in response to compound treatment. Multivariate statistics provide a range of data reduction and classification tools to not only identify hits but also to classify the compound’s effect and to consider different responses in subpopulations.	Utilizing	multivariate	analysis	of	phenotypic	 profiles enhances the potential of hit discovery in small molecule screening and help classifying hits for target identification. The rationale behind this strategy will be illustrated with screening examples.

2:40-3:10 Multivariate Characterization of High-Content Data for Relevant Phenotypic Change in Type II Diabetes Screening

Sponsored by

Jonathan Z. Sexton, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE), North Carolina Central University Current fluorescent probe technology and increased multiplexation in HCS can result in an overwhelming array of cellular data. The characterization of subtle phenotypic changes can be challenging and resulting phenotypic endpoints are often non-obvious. Phenotypic change must then be reported back to an information management system for registration of biological data with chemical structures. Here we present an automated method for the discovery of relevant phenotypic change through multivariate analysis of preliminary HCA data in the assay development phase to guide discovery in large scale screening efforts, including (1) How to use multivariate techniques to discover meaningful phenotypic change; (2) Reduction of primary screening data to facilitate the merging of biological data with chemical information for hit triage and prioritization in data management systems; (3) Tools for developing a high content screening information pipeline.

3:10-3:35 Live-Cell Imaging of Caspase Activation for High-Content Screening
Hakim Djaballah, Ph.D., Director, HTS Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Caspases are central to the execution of programmed cell death and their activation constitutes the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. No method currently available that allows continuous live-cell monitoring of caspase activation in high-content assays; which require amenability to high-density plate formats, live and continuous monitoring, and the fluorogenic reporter to be non-toxic and does not interfere with nor stimulate induction of apoptosis. My talk will focus on the adaptation of a high-content assay method utilizing the DEVD-NucView™ 488fluorogenic substrate that meet the required criteria, and for the first time, we show caspase activation in live cells induced either by chemicals or RNAi. I will present data on the adaptation, optimization and validation of the use of this substrate as a homogeneous, live assay reporter for monitoring real-time kinetics of induction of apoptosis in 384well plates, and discuss its advantages for use in real time screening of chemical and RNAi libraries for the rapid identification of novel modulators of apoptosis; and discuss the merits of using this new high-content live cell assay to screen chemical or RNAi libraries.

3:10-3:35 Combining High-Content and High-Throughput Screening
Claudine Grepin, Ph.D., Head, Lead Discovery Technology, Sanofi-Aventis Pharma R&D, France Accurate prediction of human responses to potential drugs is often unreliable and leads to a high attrition rate in development. One of the strategies implemented to increase the chance of isolating the best chemical matter as early as possible during the drug discovery process is to implement cell-based screens, which address targets and compounds in a more physiological context. High-Content Analysis assay formats are examples of those cellular assays that provide accurate and relevant multiple parameter information from a unique experiment. The presentation will focus on a few selected examples where High-Content Screening has been scaled up to High-Throughput Screening to facilitate the decision on compound progression thanks to the wealth of data generated. The added value and lessons learned will be discussed.

Oliver Poeschke, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, Assay Development, Biomolecular Pharmacology Lead Discovery, Merck Serono HCS has evolved from a new technology into a powerful compound screening platform over the last years in our company. This is documented by a number of success stories, of which two case studies will be presented. I will describe how HCS enables the identification, characterization and chemical optimization of small molecules leading to in-vivo active compounds in the early drug discovery phase.

4:45-5:10 The Role of Open Source in High-Content Screening Informatics
Karol Kozak, Ph.D., Head, Computation Analysis, HCA/HTS Informatics, LMC-RISC, Institute for Biochemistry Its main strength – the high information content of the delivered data (images) – means at the same time a considerable challenge on the IT side. The aim of this presentation is to describe an open-source informatics platform for integrating, sharing and processing HCS data using a workflow-oriented architecture. This talk will focus on a platform that covers the whole process of a HCS screen, from the basic compound management through the image processing and data handling, up to the analysis of the screens. The platform offers not only standard/routine functions but also integrates the newest, state-of-the-art algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, standards and knowledge management. A further specialty of this platform is that we want to actively make use of its open source nature by creating an international development community through which one can reach not only new informatics solutions but broaden the application areas and accelerate the development speed.

4:45-5:10 Using FLIM to Analyze 2-Way and 3-Way Protein:Protein Interaction and Caspase Activation in Live Cells
David Andrews, Ph.D., Professor, Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Canada Research Chair in Membrane Biogenesis, McMaster University We have been using Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM) to measure protein:protein interactions in live cells by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescence proteins. Methods to measure caspase activity in live cells using a single molecule consisting of a CFP donor linked via a caspase site to an YFP acceptor are well established. We have successfully automated this assay for high throughput using the FLIM Opera. To examine interactions crucial for regulation of apoptosis by interactions between different Bcl-2 family proteins is more challenging because the relative concentration of the two proteins varies in different areas of the cell. Because fluorescence lifetime is independent of concentration we used FLIM FRET to measure 3-way interactions between the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid, Bad and Bim. In a single cell it was possible to examine drug induced FRET between CFP-Bid and YFP-Bcl-XL as well as FRET between YFPBcl-XL and RFP-Bad or RFP-Bim on mitochondria. Currently we are using this approach to examine in live cells the molecular mechanism of drugs such as ABT-737 that are designed to disrupt the interactions between Bcl-XL and its binding partners.

5:10-5:35 High-Content Screening of the NIH MLSMR Library
Susanne Heynen-Genel, Ph.D., Director, HighContent Screening Systems, Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics, Burnham Institute for Medical Research The	Conrad	Prebys	Center	for	Chemical	Genomics	(CPCCG)	at	the	Burnham	Institute	for	Medical	 Research is one of four comprehensive screening centers for the NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN, http://mli. nih.gov). While these comprehensive screening centers cover all aspects of small molecule library screening	and	probe	development,	CPCCG	also	 specializes in high-content analysis and screening. Thus high-content assays against very diverse targets are being developed and screened at CPCCG.		This	presentation	will	describe	some	 examples of the image-based assays and screens run against the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) library including recently	performed	GPCR	and	lipid	screens.

5:10-5:35 The Open Microscopy Environment: Image Informatics for Biological Microscopy and HCAs
Jason Swedlow, Ph.D., Senior Research Fellow & Reader, Gene Regulation & Expression, University of Dundee We have developed an open-source software framework to address the needs for image data integration and interoperability known as the Open Microscopy Environment (OME). OME has three components—an open data model for biological imaging, standardized file formats and software libraries for data file conversion and software tools for image data management and analysis. The OME Data Model has recently been updated to more fully support fluorescence filter sets, the requirement for unique identifiers, including LSIDs, and screening experiments using multi-well plates. The OME-TIFF file format and the Bio-Formats file format library provide an easy-to-use set of tools for converting data from proprietary file formats. These resources enable access to data by different processing and visualization applications, and sharing of data between scientific collaborators. The Java-based OMERO platform includes server and client applications that combine an image metadata database, a binary image data repository and high performance visualization and analysis. The current release of OMERO includes interfaces for C/C++ and Python to support a wide variety of client applications and support for Matlab-based applications like Cellprofiler. For computational analysis of images, this standardized interface provides a single mechanism for accessing image data of all types-- regardless of the original file format. Moreover, a compute distribution facility is included, to support multi-cpu computing installations.

5:10-5:35 Live-Cell Imaging of Specific RNAs Using Fluorescent Probes
Gang Bao, Ph.D., Professor, Robert A. Milton Chair in Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering Distinguished Professor, Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University With the recent development of novel techniques for imaging RNA in living cells, it is now possible to study the dynamics of RNA expression and regulation. In this presentation I will review the application of fluorescent probes, especially molecular beacons, in live-cell RNA detection, viral infection studies, and the isolation of stem cells. Common challenges faced by fluorescent probes, such as probe design, delivery, and target accessibility, are also discussed. It is expected that continued advancements in live-cell imaging of RNA will open new and exciting opportunities in a wide range of biological and medical applications.

5:35-6:00 Automated HighContent Screening for Compounds That Disassemble the Perinucleolar Compartment (PNC)
Steve Titus, Ph.D., Staff Scientist, Biology, NIH Chemical Genomics Center We have conducted an automated high-content screen using a collection of 140,000 small molecules to look for compounds which disassemble the PNC. The assay was conducted on an	InCell	1000	imager	in	1536	well	format.	From	 the 140,000 compounds screened, 120 hits were identified and ordered, and 91 confirmed activity. I will discuss the assay optimization, screen, and hit confirmation processes in detail.

5:35-6:00 Bioassay Ontology and Software Tools to Integrate and Analyze Diverse Data Sets
Stephan C. Schurer, Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor, Pharmacology, Center for Computational Science, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine The primary goal of the project is the development of a content and software framework to enable systematic mining and analysis of large screening data sets from diverse biological assays, including HCA studies. Currently, bioassay experiments and their endpoints are described primarily as free text. Formalizing this knowledge is required for any computational analysis that involves multiple assay data sets. It is also required to integrate these data with existing bioinformatics resources, such as pathway and interaction databases. A framework to enable researchers to exploit these enormous resources will improve the efficiency of chemical biology research projects, and will lead to the discovery of treatments, usually compounds, that may not emerge from individual screening campaigns.

5:35-6:00 Quantitative Molecular Imaging in Living Cells via FLIM
Mary-Ann Mycek, Ph.D., Associate Professor & Associate Chair, Biomedical Engineering; Faculty Member, Applied Physics Program; Core Member, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) employs fluorophore lifetime, rather than fluorescence intensity, for image contrast. Compared to intensity-based methods, lifetime imaging requires less calibration and/or correction for fluorophore concentration, photobleaching, and other artifacts that affect intensity measurements. FLIM has been employed to probe the microenvironments of endogenous and exogenous fluorophores, including measurements of cellular metabolic co-factors, pH, dissolved gas concentration, and molecular interactions via FRET. Several applications of FLIM for quantitative, live cell imaging will be described, including studies of cellular metabolic pathways, improved FRET detection of oncogene association, microfluidic bioreactor characterization for continuous cell culture, and improved precision for low-light FLIM imaging.

Imaging Infection: An Impetus to Technology Innovation in High-Content Analysis
Spencer Shorte, Plateforme d’Imagerie Dynamique (PFID), Imagopole, Institut Pasteur, Paris A wealth of celluloid evidence details “high-content analysis” (HCA) of living microbiology using a microscope and cinema camera as early as 1907 . However, these remarkable records were lost for decades as an historic artifact. Today, a variety of technologies including imaging & flow cytometry, multi-dimensional dynamic imaging, ultra-structural microscopy and intravital imaging facilitate analysis of infectious disease processes at sub-cellular, cellular, tissue and whole organism levels providing rich information content. Using	malaria	as	a	disease	model,	this	lecture	will	describe	multi-facetted	 visualization of the disease process, including high-resolution intravital multidimensional dynamic imaging that ultimately helped the scientific animation filmmaker Drew Berry to complete his magnificent animated description of the malaria life cycle. In perspective, studies on infectious biology require relevant, high-fidelity experimental paradigms, and improved HCA approaches will better ensure fragile host-pathogen interactions are analyzed in situ without compromise.

NOVEL FLUORESCENT PROBES AND BIOSENSORS 11:30-11:55 Development and Characterization of a Novel AR -TIF2 Protein-Protein Interaction Biosensor HCS Assay to Measure Co-Activator Recruitment Interactions
Paul A. Johnston, Ph.D., Research Associate Professor, Pharmacology & Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine The AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction biosensor (PPIB) was developed to measure	the	interactions	between	the	p160	steroid	receptor	coactivators	 (SRC) with nuclear hormone receptors (NRs). Researchers at Cellumen Inc. have generated recombinant adenovirus (R-AV) constructs of the nuclear anchored	Transcription	Initiation	Factor-2	(TIF2-GFP)	and	the	nuclear-cytoplasmic Androgen receptor (AR-RFP) shuttling components of the PPIB. We have characterized the responses of the AR-TIF2 PPIB to androgens and developed a HCS assay that is sufficiently robust and reproducible to be compatible with screening large compound libraries. We have utilized the ARTIF2 PPIB to characterize and quantify the phenotypes of AR anti-androgens (Biclautamide & Flutamide) that have been used in the clinic to treat prostate cancer. We have also characterized and quantified the phenotype produced by	the	Hsp90	ATPase	inhibitor	17-AAG.	

NEW BIOLOGICAL MODELS FOR HCA 11:30-11:55 High-Content Screen for Compounds that Modulate Misfolded Protein Aggregation in C. elegans
Stephen Pak, Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor, Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh C. elegans is a powerful genetic organism useful for the study of human diseases. Recently, we developed a C. elegans model of a human misfolded protein accumulation disorder, a1-antitrypsin-deficiency. To facilitate the identification of therapeutic compounds, we developed a fully automated, whole organism-based assay for the high content screening of small molecules. Initial screens identified hit compounds that significantly reduce the accumulation of protein aggregates. Characterization of these compounds should provide valuable insight into pathways responsible for the disposition of protein aggregates. These results demonstrate the utility of C. elegans in drug discovery and provide a stepping-stone for future C. elegans-based drug screens.

11:55-12:20 Structure-Guided Improvements to Fluorescent Proteins
Mark Rizzo, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine A full complement of colors for genetically-encoded fluorescent proteins has nearly been achieved. However, the far majority of these proteins are less than ideal probes for live cell microscopy because of problems with overall brightness when observed with existing imaging technology. Limited brightness, and in particular, low quantum yields are particularly important for cyan fluorescent proteins because they are widely used as donors in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays and energy transfer efficiency is directly related to the donor quantum yield. To improve the quantum yield of Cerulean fluorescent protein, we used site-directed mutagenesis to optimize residues surrounding the chromophore. This new variant, mCerulean2, has a greatly improved quantum yield of 0.78, is 50% brighter than mCerulean in cells, and is a superior donor for FRET experiments. In an in vitro assay, FRET with mCerulean2: mVenus can be detected with 7 .5-fold less protein than for mCerulean. With increased brightness and performance for FRET experiments, mCerulean2 is well suited for FRET experiments in living cells.

11:55-12:20 Quantitation of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Signaling by High-Content Analysis in Transgenic Zebrafish
Andreas Vogt, Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor, Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh The zebrafish is one of few multicellular organisms compatible with compound screening in multiwell plates. The zebrafish embryo is particularly suited for image based screens due to its small size and optical transparency. We have developed an image analysis method to quantify activation of fibroblast	growth	factor	(FGF)	signaling	in	a	transgenic	zebrafish	reporter	line	 that	expresses	green	fluorescent	protein	(GFP)	in	particular	regions	of	the	 brain. The system delivers graded responses and quantified the activity of a	novel	small	molecule	inhibitor	of	the	dual	specificity	phosphatase	DUSP6	 (MKP-3).

12:20-12:45 High-Content Imaging Approaches to Interrogate in vitro and in vivo Tumor Angiogenesis
Mark Uhlik, Ph.D., Senior Research Scientist, Angiogenesis & Tumor Microenvironment DHT, Eli Lilly & Co. Solid tumors require the development of new blood vessels via angiogenesis for their continued growth and metastasis. Tumor angiogenesis is a complex biological process involving multiple cell types, soluble factors, microenvironmental cues, and cell-cell interactions. In order to enable the discovery of anti-angiogenic compounds that interfere with these biological processes we are pursuing a phenotypic drug discovery approach driven predominately by cell-based high-content assays. This high content-enabled paradigm of phenotypic drug discovery provides an avenue to 1) identify compounds that modulate molecular targets from a variety of functional classes, 2) identify compounds that modulate pathways not previously identified as having roles in angiogenesis, 3) screen compounds in complex biological systems composed of multiple cell types, and 4) recognize and filter out compounds that	may	be	overtly	cytotoxic.		Using	an	endothelial/mesenchymal	stem	 cell co-culture model of cord formation and assays to assess endothelial migration, proliferation, and apoptosis we are able to bin compounds into discrete phenotypic activity classes. Compounds are further tested in tumor xenograft models for in vivo angiogenesis and tumor growth properties using quantitative multiplexed fluorescence tissue imaging.

12:20-12:45 Multidimensional Fluorescence Imaging for Cell Biology, High-Content Analysis and Label-Free Tissue Analysis
Sunil Kumar, Ph.D., Research Associate, Photonics Group, Physics Department, Imperial College London This talk will review our development and application of multidimensional fluorescence imaging (MDFI) technology, with an emphasis on fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), implemented in microscopy, endoscopy and tomography. Applied to autofluorescence, MDFI can provide label-free molecular contrast in biological tissue for ex vivo and in vivo applications. For cell biology, high speed FLIM can be used to image the spatio-temporal organisation of proteins and their interactions, including via FRET, for which we are working to improve the imaging speed and spatial resolution. For high content analysis, we have developed an automated high-speed optically-sectioned FLIM multiwell plate reader applicable to fixed and live cells. We have also developed a multiplexed FRET microscope capable of simultaneously imaging two different protein-protein interactions in a cell signalling network. For 3-D imaging of embryos and small organisms, we have developed a FLIM optical projection tomography (OPT) system and are working towards tomographic FLIM and FRET of cleared samples and of live animals for dynamic studies in vivo.

12:45-1:10 Controlling the Signaling Dynamics of Rho GTPases and Cell Motility Using Genetically Encoded Photoactivatable Proteins
Yi Wu, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina For many highly dynamic cell behaviors such as cell migration, signaling occurs transiently at specific locations, with subsecond and submicron precision. Study of such rapid dynamics has been hindered by our inability to manipulate protein activities with precise spatio-temporal control in living cells and animals. Here we describe the engineering of several geneticallyencoded	photoactivatable	Rho	GTPases	using	a	light-responsive	protein	 domain (LOV) derived from plant phototropin, enabling reversible and repeatable control of cell signaling in living systems.

HCA FOR siRNA SCREENING 8:30-8:35 8:35-9:00 Chairperson’s Opening Remarks The Pros and Cons of siRNA Use in HCS 8:30-8:35

HCA FOR TOxICITY PROFILING Chairperson’s Opening Remarks

Eugenio Fava, Ph.D., Director, Services and Facilities, German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases The use of siRNA in high-content screens (HCS) in mammalian cells has become a valuable method to identify and describe genetic relationships in both basic biology and disease mechanisms. However, the use of siRNAs in HCS has been hampered by an inherent problem of siRNA, namely off target. Off target is the phenomenon that takes place when genes with incomplete complementarity are downregulated by the siRNA. This leads to problems in data interpretation and overall difficulties in the determination of hits. Although there are different strategies to reduce siRNA target, ranging from design to chemical modification, avoiding it is very difficult if not impossible. Here we analyze and discuss a complementary method approach that allows us to evaluate the siRNA off target from the HCS data. We used this method to compare and contrast different siRNA technologies and the results will be discussed.

8:35-9:00 Refinement of Predictive Cytotoxicity Assays Using High-Content Analysis and Extension into Different Cell Lines
Peter O’Brien, D.V.M., Ph.D., Veterinary Clinical Pathologist, Pathology, University College Dublin, Ireland Our	HepG2	predictive	cytotoxicity	assay	using	HCA	was	refined,	along	with	 the associated process and data analysis and applied in new capacities, including screening in academic “drug discovery” activities. It was streamlined and made more user-friendly, reproducible, and cost-effective at the biological reagents, assaying, and data reduction and analysis ends. Its effective application was extended into several other cell lines, including lymphoid, monocytic, and intestinal, and into other programs and disciplines, including in cancer drug evaluation, food health, and environmental monitoring.

9:30-9:55 A High-Content Assay to Screen for Modulators of the miRNA Machinery
David Shum, Ph.D., Assay Development Specialist, HTS Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering MicroRNAs are small non-coding regulatory RNAs reducing stability and/ or translation of fully or partially sequence-complementary target mRNAs in plants and animals. Their upregulation has been reported in many malignancies and proposed to regulate several tumor suppressor pathways; the understanding of their biogenesis may offer novel therapeutic approaches and intervention. There are no well documented modulators to help us study the pathway and unravel its biological significance; for this purpose, we set out to develop a high-content assay using a stably transfected HeLa S3 cells	expressing	EGFP	under	miR-21	regulation	as	the	reporter	gene	carries	 a	sequence	with	perfect	complementarity	to	miR-21	in	its	3‘	UTR	region,	 thus decrease in miR-21 levels would induce increase in the expression and	maturation	of	the	EGFP	reporter	which	can	easily	be	imaged	using	 automated microscopy. We will present and discuss our assay development and validation against both a pilot chemical library and a custom siRNA library targeting known genes of the miRNA pathway together with few essential housekeeping genes to assess transfection efficiencies. Our high-content assay and its dual adaptation would allow screening and discovery of novel modulators of the miRNA pathway and a better understanding of the regulatory components of its maturation machinery.

9:30-9:55 In-vitro Toxicity Profiling in Non-Adherent Cells by Automated High-Content Microscopy
Michael Prummer, Ph.D., Scientist, High-Content Screening, Discovery Technologies, Pharma Research, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. . Most High-Content Screening assays are run with adherent cells and not with suspension cells due to practical limitations. However, there are established cellular models for conventional microscopy in which suspension cells are used. We are presenting here a novel and universal approach to immobilize non-adherent cells in multi-well format for automated microscopy that fills this gap. As a first application we report on a high-content toxicity assay at the single-cell level using an innovative new preparation tool. For image segmentation and object classification we have developed an adaptive	and	iterative	algorithm	in	collaboration	with	Definiens	AG.	To	extract	a	 toxicity score from the derived data, non-parametric statistical methods were employed. Taken together, these developments open up new routes for highcontent screening with suspension cells.

HCA FOR PATHWAY ANALYSIS 10:20-10:45 Phenotypic Drug Discovery to Identify Novel Oncolytics using High-Content Fingerprinting
Louis Stancato, Ph.D., Principal Research Scientist, Cancer Growth & Translational Genetics, Eli Lilly & Co. The development of high-content imaging subpopulation analysis tools has enabled a high resolution look into cancer cell function, and as a result is now an integral technology in Lilly Oncology. One area in particular that has experienced a renaissance is phenotypic drug discovery, a discipline ideally suited to the application of HCI. By incorporating custom in-house informatics tools we are able to advance molecules with novel mechanisms of action through the lead generation process, in particular chemical series previously discarded due to perceived failure in conventional “targeted” approaches. This presentation will focus on how the HCI informatics tools are used to identify, phenotypically fingerprint and subsequently advance in vivo, novel anti-cancer molecules using both cultured cell and cancer stem cell models.

NEURONAL SCREENING 10:20-10:45 Using HCA to Identify a Transcription Factor Family that Regulates the Intrinsic Ability of Neurons to Extend Axons
Vance Lemmon, Ph.D., Professor, Neurological Surgery, Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine As neurons age, they lose the ability to extend axons, resulting in failure of regeneration after injury to the central nervous system. We used HCA to screen genes that were differentially expressed during development in retinal neurons and cortical neurons. We identified a family of transcription factors that regulate axon growth in vitro and in vivo. In the course of these studies we found that some types of primary neurons are more suitable for detecting increases in neurite growth than other types of neurons.

10:45-11:10 High-Content Analysis of Synapse Formation in Primary Neuronal Cultures for Developmental Neurotoxicity Screening
William R. Mundy, Ph.D., Integrated Systems Toxicology Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Cell-based assays can model neurodevelopmental processes including neurite growth and synaptogenesis, and may be useful for screening and evaluation of large numbers of chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity. This work describes the use of HCA to detect chemical effects on synaptogenesis in vitro. Pre-synaptic puncta were associated with the cell body and dendrites of primary cortical neurons, and increased over several weeks in culture. Several chemicals were identified that decreased synapse number during development in vitro.

10:45-11:10 Targeting Cytokine Receptor-JAK-STAT Signaling Pathways - Development of an HCS Assay to Identify Selective Inhibitors of STAT-3 Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation
Paul A. Johnston, Ph.D., Research Associate Professor, Pharmacology & Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine The Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) are transcription factors that mediate the effects of growth factors and cytokines to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, migration, and apoptosis. Activated STAT3 is an oncogene that directs tumor cells toward proliferation and survival, induces angiogenesis and alters the tumor microenvironment, and promotes tumor metastases through its effects on cell migration and invasion. In sharp contrast activated STAT1 is considered a tumor suppressor because it is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, promotes tumor cell apoptosis, and enhances tumor immunity. Consequently, the discovery of a STAT3 selective inhibitor would be a highly desirable goal for the development of an anti-cancer drug. The development of an HCS assay to identify selective inhibitors of STAT-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation will be described.

11:10-11:35 Screening Neuronal Pattern Formation in vivo
Sebastian Munck, Ph.D., Coordinator, Light Microscopy and Imaging Network LiMoNe, Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, K.U. Leuven We would like to describe an assay for imaging-based high-content analysis of the network formation in vivo. The neurons in the optic lobe of Drosophila melanogaster form a stereotypical pattern. In the optical system neuronal / electrical activity is believed to be a crucial part in the pattern formation process. We want to dissect the genetic and activity depended processes. The aim of the project is to identify the key players of the pattern formation and to modulate them by combining the power of a genetic screen in drosophila with the imaging based read out of the formed pattern.

11:35-12:00 High-Content Cellomics Cell Cycle Analysis of the Effects of HSP90 Inhibition
Susan Lyman, Ph.D., Research Scientist, Exelixis, Inc. Cell cycle analysis has traditionally been carried out by FACS – or more recently, by combining a measurement of DNA content with imaging of one or more phase-specific readouts, such as phospho-histone H3. We have used the latter approach to develop a novel and robust high-throughput Cellomics-based cell cycle assay that accurately reports the phase status of a	cell	(G1,	S,	G2,	or	M)	as	well	as	its	DNA	content	(2n,	4n,	>4n).		We	have	 applied this technique to examine the cell cycle perturbations caused by inhibition of HSP90, a molecular chaperone that enhances the stability of a wide spectrum of client proteins. HSP90 clients include cell cycle proteins such	as	PLK1	and	CDC2	as	well	as	cancer-associated	proteins	such	as	EGFR,	 ERBB2, and MET, making it an attractive cancer target. This presentation will illustrate the Cellomics cell cycle technique and will highlight the strikingly similar complex cell cycle perturbations induced by 3 different small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors in a large panel of immortalized cancer cell lines.
