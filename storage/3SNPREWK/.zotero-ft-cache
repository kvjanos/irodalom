Abstract During interphase, chromosomes are arranged into territories within a highly organized nuclear space containing several compartments. It is becoming clear that this complex nuclear arrangement is important for gene regulation and therefore expression. The study of chromosome organization in interphase requires highresolution imaging methods that at the same time allow for ﬂexible labelling strategies and preserve nuclear structure. Tokuyasu cryosections of cells or tissues provide a simple, high-resolution platform for performing immunolabelling and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on well-preserved samples. Here we show how FISH performed on thin cryosections (cryo-FISH) can be used for the study of chromosome organization at high resolution and in a quantitative manner. We have measured chromosome intermingling, volume and radial position, in resting and activated human lymphocytes, and observed chromosome-speciﬁc differences between the two cellular states. These differences are in part related to the nuclear expansion that occurs during activation, but are also likely to be tied to their different transcriptional proﬁles. Extrapolation of our dataset to the whole genome suggests that activated cells contain a lower amount of chromatin involved in intermingling than resting cells.

Introduction The organization of the cell nucleus has attracted much of the attention of cell and molecular biologists in recent years. It is now clear that the nucleus is a highly complex organelle, containing various nonmembranous compartments, or nuclear bodies, which constitute structural centres for different nuclear functions (Spector 2003, Handwerger & Gall 2006).

Transcription of ribosomal genes, for example, is carried out within the nucleolus in large RNA polymerase (RNAP) I aggregates, and transcription by RNAP II and III is similarly organized, only in smaller foci (Martin & Pombo 2003). Splicing speckles, Cajal bodies and PML bodies are some of other nuclear bodies that have roles in nuclear function, and seem to establish interactions with speciﬁc genomic loci, which may be necessary for

414 their function (Lamond and Spector 2003, Dellaire & Bazett-Jones 2004, Handwerger & Gall 2006). Chromosomes are also organized into domains, termed chromosome territories (CTs), which have non-random radial positions in the nucleus that are evolutionarily conserved (Tanabe et al. 2002, Cremer et al. 2003, 2006). Nevertheless, chromosome position is tissue-speciﬁc to a certain degree, and proximity or extent of intermingling between CTs correlates with the respective potential for translocations (Parada et al. 2004, Branco & Pombo 2006, Soutoglou et al. 2007). Chromosome organization during interphase also has important implications in gene expression. Different models of chromosome organization have tried to explain how transcription is organized within a CT, and how it relates with the various levels of chromatin folding (Dehghani et al. 2005, Cremer et al. 2006, Branco & Pombo 2007). Namely, chromosome conformation seems to be important for the establishment of long-range functional interactions between loci up to several Mbp away, or even across different chromosomes (Tolhuis et al. 2002, Osborne et al. 2004, Lomvardas et al. 2006). These intra- and inter-chromosomal associations are often tissue-speciﬁc, and were recently found to be surprisingly frequent (Simonis et al. 2006, Wurtele & Chartrand 2006, Zhao et al. 2006), such that they are likely to contribute to the spatial organization of chromosomes (Pombo & Branco 2007). However, it remains unclear which of these associations are direct functional interactions, and which may simply reﬂect a compartmentalization of chromatin, for example, into active and inactive compartments in the nucleus (Simonis et al. 2006). Given the small dimensions of some of the nuclear entities, and the sub-micrometer scale of functional spatial associations, experimental systems for the study of chromosome organization need to yield high-resolution images. Additionally, spatial preservation during ﬁxation and labelling procedures are of utmost importance to accurately assess the spatial relationships between the different nuclear landmarks. Classical two-dimensional (2D) FISH protocols on whole cells severely disrupt nuclear architecture and may lead to artefacts (Hepperger et al. 2007). Spatial preservation can be improved with three-dimensional (3D) FISH protocols, at least at the light microscopy (LM) level (Solovei et al. 2002), but this comes at the cost of minimizing treatments that can improve signal intensity. In these

M. R. Branco et al. protocols, the stringency of the ﬁxation step is also compromised to allow probe accessibility, which potentially alters nuclear organization (Guillot et al. 2004). In addition, imaging of whole cells using optical sections provides limited resolution (at best 500 nm axially on a confocal microscope), although current developments in light microscopy are expected to break this limit (Hell 2007). While the use of strong ﬁxatives, such as those used for conventional electron microscopy (EM) studies, can provide good ultrastructural preservation (Figure 1B), it precludes probe accessibility in whole cells. Thin sectioning of cells provides accessibility, and can thus compensate for the stringent ﬁxation step (Branco et al. 2005). Whereas most resins used for cell embedding before sectioning hinder further labelling procedures, sections of frozen sucroseembedded cells (Tokuyasu cryosections; Figure 1A) provide the same labelling ﬂexibility as whole cells (Tokuyasu 1973, Pombo 2007). Sectioning also improves resolution in the light microscope, as the axial resolution becomes the thickness of the section (i.e. 100Y200 nm; Figure 1C). Placing cryosections directly on metal grids, instead of glass coverslips, allows for their use in EM imaging without the need for additional laborious resin-embedding steps and further sectioning. In fact, LM imaging can be performed on sections mounted on metal grids, which makes them extremely useful for correlative studies, where regions of interest can ﬁrst be identiﬁed by LM, at high throughput, before imaging by EM, at high resolution (Pombo et al. 1999a, Robinson et al. 2001, Branco & Pombo 2006). Strategies for correlative microscopy using whole cells and resin embedding normally avoid the need for post-LM labelling by using, for example, ﬂuorochromes (namely, GFP) that photooxidize 3:3¶diaminoobenzidine to produce an electron-dense precipitate (Grabenbauer et al. 2005). Quantum dots, which are ﬂuorescent and electron-dense semiconductor nanocrystals, have also been used (Nisman et al. 2004). Highly sensitive immunolabelling protocols for cryosections have been developed and used extensively for the study of transcription factories (Pombo et al. 1999b, Branco et al. 2005, Faro-Trindade & Cook 2006). We have recently developed cryo-FISH, a FISH protocol for cryosections that provides highresolution imaging of chromosomes and single genomic loci at the LM level and good spatial

Figure 1. Tokuyasu cryosections provide optimal nuclear preservation and are compatible with high-resolution ﬂuorescence imaging. (A) Tokuyasu cryosectioning involves chemical ﬁxation, sucrose embedding and freezing of cells or tissues, before thin sections are cut by ultracryomicrotomy. Frozen sections are collected on sucrose drops and transferred to a solid support, and the sucrose is washed away before labelling with antibodies or nucleic acid probes. The different cellular proﬁles present in a cryosection (along red lines; S1Y4) originate from different cells in the tissue and represent different parts of the nucleus. Pale yellow, cytoplasm; dark blue, nucleus; light blue, nucleoli; green, splicing speckles. (B) Cryosections are obtained from cells ﬁxed in conditions that preserve cellular ultrastructure. HeLa cells were ﬁxed as for cryosectioning, stained and Epon-embedded (Guillot et al. 2004); imaging by electron microscopy shows good preservation of membrane integrity, organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and nucleolus. Bar = 500 nm.

preservation of chromatin at the nanometer scale, and that can be used for correlative EM imaging (Branco & Pombo 2006). The use of a stronger ﬁxative than in conventional 3D-FISH protocols increases the resistance of cryosections to the harsh treatments used to improve probe accessibility and therefore signal intensity and coverage, while retaining spatial preservation of the chromatin (Branco & Pombo 2006). One disadvantage of cryo-FISH is that 3D information is lost for structures larger than the thickness of the section. As serial sectioning and reconstruction of whole cells is technically very

challenging, each cell is typically represented by a single random section, which can make difﬁcult the quantiﬁcation of large-scale parameters, such as radial position. However, the mathematical tools of stereology, which were initially developed to deal with quantiﬁcation problems on electron-micrographs (Weibel 1979), can be readily applied to cryo-FISH images. We have previously used cryo-FISH to study chromosome organization in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-activated human lymphocytes, and showed that CTs intermingle signiﬁcantly, mostly at their

416 edges (Branco & Pombo 2006). The amount of intermingling across different pairs of CTs correlated with their translocation potential and changed in a CT-speciﬁc fashion upon inhibition of transcription. This suggested that transcription may mediate interchromosomal associations and that these are significant enough to inﬂuence chromosome organization at least at the local level (Branco & Pombo 2006, 2007). Cryo-FISH has also been used to detect longrange interactions between individual genomic loci (Simonis et al. 2006; M. R. Branco and A. Pombo, unpublished) and to study changes in the position of genomic loci in relation to their CTs and to transcription factories (Branco & Pombo 2006, Noordermer et al. 2008). Here we investigate differences in CT organization between resting and PHA-activated lymphocytes, in particular at the level of chromosome intermingling, but also chromosome volume and nuclear radial position. Stimulation of resting human lymphocytes with PHA increases nuclear size and causes largescale decondensation of chromatin, with concomitant transcriptional activation (Kysela et al. 2005), leading to distinct transcriptional proﬁles between resting and activated lymphocytes (Torelli et al. 1981). These changes that occur during lymphocyte activation are likely to depend on and inﬂuence the spatial organization of chromosomes.

M. R. Branco et al. nitrogen as described previously (Pombo et al. 1999b). Cryosections were cut using an UltraCut UCT 52 ultracryomicrotome (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK), captured in sucrose drops, and transferred to coverslips. Sections on sucrose drops were stored at j20-C. Immunolabelling For immunolabelling, cryosections were washed in PBS, incubated in 0.1% Triton XY100 in PBS (10 min), and labelled as described previously (Pombo et al. 1999b), except that PBS+ contained 0.1% casein. Serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II was indirectly immunolabelled with H5 (1/1000; Covance, Berkeley, CA, USA). Cryo-FISH Directly labelled (Rhodamine, Texas Red, or FITC) whole human chromosome paints (Qbiogene, Cambridge, UK) were corrected for low-level background by addition of human Cot1 DNA (Roche; 1.7 or 3.3 mg/ml ﬁnal concentration), denatured at 70-C for 10 min, and re-annealed at 37-C for 30 min before hybridization. After washing with PBS, cryosections were incubated at 37-C with 250 mg/ml RNase A (1 h), treated with 0.1 M HCl (10 min), dehydrated in ethanol (30Y100% series, on ice, 3 min each), heat-denatured (8 min, 80-C) in 70% deionized formamide in 2Â SSC, and dehydrated as above, before probe was added. Hybridization was carried out at 37-C for 940 h. Post-hybridization washes were as follows: 50% formamide in 2Â SSC 42-C (3Â over 25 min), 0.1Â SSC (60-C, 3Â over 30 min), and 4Â SSC with 0.1% Tween-20 (42-C, 10 min). Nuclei were counterstained with 2 mM TOTO-3 or 20 ng/ml DAPI in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Microscopy For confocal laser scanning microscopy, images were collected sequentially on a Leica TCS SP2 (100X PL APO 1.40 oil objective) equipped with argon (488 nm) and HeNe (543 nm; 633 nm) lasers, or a Leica TCS SP1 (100X PL APO 1.35 oil objective) equipped with UV (351/364 nm), argon (488 nm),

Materials and methods Cell culture, ﬁxation, and cryosectioning Human female peripheral blood mononuclear cells were puriﬁed by a Leuco-Sep Separation Media (Human; Harlan Sera-Lab, Loughborough, UK) density gradient centrifugation (500 g, 30 min). Cells were either directly processed for cryosectioning or grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% heatinactivated FCS, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), 50 mg/ml b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Dorset, UK), and 5 mg/ml PHA (Sigma) for 72 h. For the preparation of cell blocks for cryosectioning, cells were ﬁxed in 4% and then 8% paraformaldehyde in 250 mM Hepes pH 7.6 (10 min and 2 h, respectively; Guillot et al. 2004). Cell pellets were embedded in 2.1 M sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen in liquid

For wide-ﬁeld LM, images were collected sequentially on a Delta-Vision Spectris system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA, USA) equipped with an Olympus IX70 wide-ﬁeld microscope (100X UPlanFl 1.3 oil objective), a CCD camera, and the following ﬁlters: DAPI, FITC, RD-TR-PE, CY-5, CFP, YFP. No bleedthrough was detected in these conditions. The use of ultrathin cryosections allows for the use of wide-ﬁeld microscopy with no reduction in axial (z) resolution and only a small reduction in lateral resolution (Pombo et al. 1999a). Image analysis and measurements Images were manually thresholded in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Edinburgh, UK) to deﬁne masks for nuclei or CTs. Threshold values were chosen empirically so that the entire CT was selected but no widespread nuclear background was included (see Supplementary Figure S1). Independent threshold selection by four different people has shown that this variability is in the same order of magnitude as the variability obtained across independent experiments (Branco & Pombo 2006). CT and intermingling volumes were calculated according to stereological methods (Weibel 1979) after collecting random images of nuclear sections. CT or intermingling areas were averaged across all sections and divided by the average of the nuclear areas. This ratio (R) is equivalent to the ratio of the respective average volumes, as shown here: AROI t Â AROI VROI ¼ ¼ ¼R ANUC t Â ANUC VNUC where AROI is the average CT or intermingling area, ANUC is the average nuclear area, VROI and VNUC are the corresponding average volumes, and t the section thickness. Using average section volumes for R gives the same result as using average whole-nuclei volumes if enough random sections from different cells are included in the calculation. To obtain several values for R within one hybridization experiment (to allow statistical analysis), images were randomly grouped and R was calculated for each group. Standard deviations remained constant with increasing number of groups until a group size was reached at which R did not contain enough informa-

417 tion and the standard deviation increased abruptly. The highest number of groups before this increase was used. Group size varied between different chromosome pairs, averaging 55 sections per group, and up to 4 groups were used in an experiment (a total of 57 to 211 sections were analysed in individual experiments). Standard deviations obtained by this method were consistent with standard deviations between independent hybridization experiments. For the measurement of CT radial position, we developed an algorithm in MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) that ﬁrst uses the thresholdbased masks of each nuclear section to calculate their radii. After estimating the axial position of each section based on the 3D average nuclear radius, it predicts the area that each of ten 3D concentric shells should occupy in that section. Masks are then generated by an interpolation algorithm so that each shell has the same shape as the section, and occupies the predicted area (Figure 5B). Fluorescence intensities of the chromosome paints are then measured for each shell and plotted against the nuclear radius (Figure 5C). For a large enough group of sections, an average radial position can be obtained from this distribution, which allows for the calculation of standard deviations across groups of sections. The same groups of sections deﬁned for intermingling analysis were used to obtain independent measurements of the average CT radial position. The sequential subtraction method was used to obtain a distribution of 3D nuclear radii from a population of random cryosections (Weibel 1979). Upon sectioning, each nucleus gives rise to a series of differently sized sections such that a polar section from a larger nucleus can have the same size as an equatorial section from a smaller nucleus. The sequential subtraction method aims to discard the contribution of all polar sections from the distribution of section sizes, leaving only the equatorial sections, which represent the true size of the 3D population. From the distribution of section sizes, the histogram class corresponding to the largest sections is assumed to be from equatorial sections of the largest nuclei. The expected frequency of polar sections generated by the sectioning of these nuclei is calculated and subtracted from the distribution (see Supplementary Figure S2). The next largest size category can then be assumed not to contain any polar sections, and the same steps are carried out sequentially for all size categories, after which only

Chromosome organization during lymphocyte activation the sizes of equatorial sections will be represented in the ﬁnal size distribution. Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SAS software (v. 9.1). Statistically signiﬁcant levels were 0.05 and 0.10 for main effects and interactions, respectively. Assumptions for the ANOVA model, i.e. constant variance and normal distribution of residuals, were conﬁrmed by graphical diagnostic tests. Comparisons of differences in intermingling, volume and position between resting and activated samples were performed with Student_s t-test using the estimates from the ANOVA models. Level of signiﬁcance was 0.05.

419 resting cells have smaller nuclei than activated cells, with average radii of 2.7 T 0.3 and 3.5 T 0.8 mm, respectively ( p G 0.0001: n = 309 and 317 nuclear sections for resting and activated cells, respectively). This is translated into an õ2-fold increase in nuclear volume upon activation of resting lymphocytes (from 82 to 180 mm3). These results are in accordance with values obtained before and after concavalin A activation (Dardick et al. 1981), but differ from recent measurements of PHA-activated cells based on the identiﬁcation of equatorial sections from resin-embedded EM samples (Kysela et al. 2005). The increase in nuclear size accompanies the largescale chromatin decondensation that is associated with an increase in transcriptional activity. In fact, the number of foci containing the active form of RNAP II in activated cells is notably higher than that in resting lymphocytes (Figure 2A,B). Effect of activation on CT volume and intermingling States of transcriptional activity or silencing are thought to be a major determinant for the establishment of interchromatin associations, but it is unclear what the inﬂuence of such associations is on the conformation and interaction between CTs in cells with different transcriptional states. For example, the higher transcriptional activity of activated cells might yield more functional interchromatin associations in this cell population when compared with resting cells. We envisaged that CT intermingling might be lower in activated cells if more intrachromosomal associations that stabilize CT conformation were present, and conversely higher if more interchromosomal associations existed. Using cryo-FISH, we have previously found that CTs intermingle signiﬁcantly in nuclei of activated lymphocytes (Branco & Pombo 2006, see also Figure 3DYF). We therefore tested whether CTs in resting cells intermingle to a

Results Morphological and transcriptional changes upon PHA-activation of human lymphocytes The ﬁrst noticeable change that occurs upon activation of resting human lymphocytes by PHA is an increase in nuclear volume. To quantify this difference, we used a stereological algorithm named the sequential subtraction method (Weibel 1979), which is suitable for the analysis of sections from round nuclei. Using experimental measurements of radii from the population of random nuclear sections, the sequential subtraction method allows estimation of the distribution of 3D radii in the original cell population from which sections were cut. For each cell type, the radii of nuclear sections were measured after staining with DAPI or TOTO-3 and the corresponding distribution of radii of the 3D cell population was calculated (Figure 2). As expected,

(A, B) The serine 2 phosphorylated form of RNAP II was immunolabelled in cryosections of resting (A) and PHA-activated (B) human lymphocytes, and counterstained with TOTO-3. Upon activation of resting cells, the number of active RNAP II foci increased concomitantly with the nuclear enlargement and transcriptional activation. Bars = 1 mm. (C, D) To measure the 3D radius of the nucleus in the two cell populations, the radii of nuclear sections of resting and activated lymphocytes were measured after staining with DAPI or TOTO-3 (n Q 309 nuclear proﬁles; (C)). The sequential subtraction method (Weibel 1979) was applied to account for the contribution of polar sections in the distribution. Solid bars represent the distribution of the measured nuclear proﬁles; open bars represent missing polar sections, as predicted by the sequential subtraction method. The values on the x-axes represent the average class size (note that the x-axes are different between the two histograms). From the frequencies of nuclear section radii, a distribution of 3D radii for both cell types was obtained (D), showing a difference that is translated into an õ2-fold difference in volume between resting and activated lymphocytes.

Chromosomes were painted in cryosections of resting (AYC) and PHA-activated (DYF) human lymphocytes and visualized by light microscopy. Examples of nuclear sections (blue) containing two intermingled chromosomes (green and red) are shown (A, D). Intermingling is best seen on greyscale images after the mask for one chromosome (white line) is overlaid on the image of the other chromosome (A¶YC, D¶YF).

similar extent, or whether differences in nuclear volume and transcriptional activity could prevent or otherwise favour intermingling. We performed cryoFISH on sections of resting human lymphocytes using several pairs of whole chromosome paints and identiﬁed nuclear proﬁles with overlapping signals after imaging on the LM, as described previously (Figure 3AYC; Branco & Pombo 2006). Chromosomes in resting cells appeared to have a similar

propensity for intermingling as those in activated cells, with intermingling occurring mostly at the edges of CTs and to varying levels. We then quantiﬁed intermingling volumes for nine different pairs of chromosomes, using a simple stereological principle, which yields values that are directly normalized to nuclear volume (Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S1). Differences in relative intermingling volumes were observed between the two

cellular states, with various pairs of chromosomes displaying a smaller extent of relative intermingling in activated cells. In fact, ANOVA testing showed that the overall effect of activation on relative intermingling was statistically signiﬁcant ( p G 0.0001), but that there were also speciﬁc changes for individual chromosome pairs ( p = 0.03: interaction between the variables Factivation_ and Fchromosome pair_). Pairwise comparisons showed that chromosome pairs 1 & 21, 1 & 2 and 1 & 4 had signiﬁcantly smaller relative intermingling values in activated than in resting cells. Pairs 1 & 22 and 2 & 3 showed less signiﬁcant decreases ( p = 0.08 and 0.11, respectively). To test whether changes in relative CT volume (i.e., normalized to nuclear size) during lymphocyte activation could explain the observed differences in chromosome intermingling between the two cellular states, we measured the volumes of the CTs tested for intermingling in resting and activated cells (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S2). PHA

activation caused an overall decrease in relative CT volumes ( p G 0.0001), with chromosomes 2, 4 and 5 showing signiﬁcantly smaller relative volumes in activated cells than in resting lymphocytes. Chromosome 21 also showed a large, nearly statistically signiﬁcant difference ( p = 0.054). These changes in relative CT volumes are likely to contribute to the observed differences in intermingling, e.g., the decrease in the relative volume of chromosome 2 could justify the corresponding decrease in intermingling for the pair 1 & 2. On the other hand, the intermingling between chromosomes 5 and 13 did not change, despite the nearly 2-fold decrease in the relative volume of chromosome 5. This may be due to other concomitant changes that occur during activation, for example, at the level of CT position or functional associations with neighbouring CTs. To gain further insights into the dynamic changes that occur during lymphocyte activation in terms of chromosome volumes and intermingling, we used the

422 average nuclear volumes measured above for resting and activated cells (Figure 3AYC) to calculate absolute values for intermingling and chromosome volumes (Figure 4C,D; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). As expected, most chromosome volumes are larger in activated cells than in resting cells ( p G 0.0001), reﬂecting the overall chromatin decondensation that occurs upon activation (Figure 4D). Nevertheless, this effect was chromosome-speciﬁc ( p G 0.0001: interaction between the variables Factivation_ and Fchromosome_), and three of the chromosomes analysed showed no statistically signiﬁcant differences in volume (5, 21 and 22). This suggests that, although the volume of many CTs accompanies the nuclear enlargement during activation with a proportional increase in size, others do not decondense as much. Absolute intermingling volumes did not show an overall change upon

M. R. Branco et al. activation ( p = 0.4), although speciﬁc effects were still observed for pairs 1 & 21 and 1 & 4, where there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in absolute intermingling volume (Figure 4C). The overall decondensation of CTs in the absence of changes in absolute intermingling suggests that a smaller fraction of chromatin from each CT intermingles in activated cells, although this would have to be conﬁrmed by analysing a larger sample of chromosome pairs. One possibility to explain the maintenance of absolute intermingling is that the overall expansion of the CTs that occurs upon activation is not proportional to the increase in nuclear volume (as suggested by the overall decrease in relative CT volumes; Figure 4B), leading to a larger nuclear space being available to CTs. Interestingly, all observed effects involved changes speciﬁc to each CT or CT pair, suggesting a relationship with gene-

speciﬁc activation of transcription during PHA stimulation. Activation-induced changes in the radial position of CTs The observation that lymphocyte activation led to chromosome-speciﬁc changes in intermingling and volume led us to investigate whether changes in radial position of CTs might create particular

chromosome neighbourhoods that could inﬂuence chromosome intermingling. Chromosomal gene density and radial position are known to correlate in PHA-activated lymphocytes (Cremer et al. 2001, Croft et al. 1999), which could be driven by the proﬁle of gene expression in each chromosome and the organization of transcription in the nucleus (Bridger et al. 2000, Parada et al. 2004). We ﬁrst tested whether chromosomes labelled by cryo-FISH in activated lymphocytes exhibited the same positioning

424 pattern as those labelled by 3D-FISH. For this purpose, we used a measuring principle previously developed by Cremer and colleagues, in which the nucleus is divided into concentric shells and the intensity of the respective chromosome paint is measured within each shell, thus obtaining a distribution of intensities along the nuclear radius (Cremer et al. 2001). The sections analysed were not consecutive sections of the same cells, but random sections of a large cell population, imposing a difﬁculty in estimating the radial position in 3D. To overcome this limitation, we ﬁrst estimated the axial position (z) of each section, based on its radius (r) and on the average 3D nuclear radius (R): z = ¾(R2 j r2). Based on the estimated axial position, the distribution of the shells in each section was obtained (Figure 5A,B), and the chromosome painting intensities were measured for each shell (Figure 5C). When applied to cryo-FISH images, this method yielded a complete set of average radial positions for all chromosomes in PHA-activated female lymphocytes (Figure 6A; Supplementary Table S3). As described previously, the average radial position shows a strong correlation with gene density (R2 = 0.64), with gene-rich chromosomes preferentially located in the nuclear interior (e.g. chromosome 19), and gene-poor chromosomes at the periphery (e.g. chromosome 18; Figure 6B). Past studies have also shown a correlation with the DNA content of each chromosome, which is probably a result of geometrical constraints, given that larger chromosomes are more likely to be located in the larger

M. R. Branco et al. nuclear periphery than at the interior (Cremer et al. 2001). To test this correlation, we plotted the average radial position against the measured CT volumes directly, instead of DNA content, which showed a mild correlation (R2 = 0.27; Figure 6C). Multiple regression analysis shows that both gene density and CT volume make a signiﬁcant contribution to radial position ( p G 0.0001 and p = 0.008, respectively). To test for differences between resting and activated cells, we measured the radial positions of the 11 chromosomes analysed above in resting lymphocytes. Activation did not have an overall effect on CT radial position ( p = 0.4), but speciﬁc differences were detected between the two cell populations (Figure 7; Supplementary Table S3). Although CT position also correlates with gene density in resting lymphocytes (R2 = 0.66: versus R2 = 0.54 for the same chromosomes in activated cells), two chromosomes (1 and 3) are signiﬁcantly more peripherally positioned in activated cells than in resting cells (and perhaps chromosome 5, p = 0.07), whereas chromosome 21 becomes more centrally positioned upon activation. Note that the average relative radial distribution of chromatin (DAPI) was the same in the two cellular states, showing that the method for measuring radial position from cryosections is not affected by differences in mean and variance of the nuclear size between the two populations (see Figure 2D). The different radial CT positions observed between resting and activated cells may be a consequence of a different network of interactions of chromo-

Error bars represent standard deviations.

Chromosome organization during lymphocyte activation somes with nuclear landmarks and/or other chromosomes between the two cell types. Differences in radial position may also affect the amount of intermingling between speciﬁc pairs of CTs. However, computer simulations using the spherical chromatin domain (SCD) model and applying two different radial position models (one random and one gene density-correlated; Kreth et al. 2004) show little difference in intermingling across chromosome pairs (G. Kreth and C. Cremer, personal communication). It remains possible that with inclusion of information on different compaction levels of gene-rich and genepoor domains in the SCD model, more striking differences would be observed.

425 DNA damage increases during T lymphocyte activation as part of a mechanism for controlled cell death (Gabdoulkhakova et al. 2007). The decrease in CT intermingling could therefore reduce the risk of translocation formation in a high DNA damage environment that could otherwise lead to cancer. We have shown here how cryo-FISH can be used as a high-resolution approach for the study of chromosome organization on spatially well-preserved cells. We also show that limitations in quantiﬁcation using random sections can be overcome by the application of simple stereological methods. An important strength of cryo-FISH that was not demonstrated here is its easy adaptability to EM studies, which can be done correlatively with LM (Branco & Pombo 2006). The reduction in the time requirement and technical difﬁculties that hinder the preparation of conventional EM samples opens the doors for the study of different aspects of nuclear organization (e.g. spatial associations between genomic loci and nuclear landmarks) at the nanometer level.

Discussion Activation of resting human lymphocytes by PHA leads to reprogramming of the transcriptional repertoire (Torelli et al. 1981). This generalized activation has dramatic consequences on nuclear organization, including chromatin decondensation and concomitant nuclear enlargement (Kysela et al. 2005). We found that lymphocyte activation also results in speciﬁc changes in the organization of individual CTs, at the level of intermingling, CT volume and radial position, which may reﬂect an adaptation to the new transcriptional program. It is possible that at least some of the differences observed upon PHA activation (namely at the level of intermingling) involve changes in intra- and interchromosomal associations, similar to what seems to occur upon transcription inhibition of activated lymphocytes (Branco & Pombo 2006). However, the nuclear enlargement, overall chromatin decondensation, and changes in the volume and radial position of individual CTs are also likely to contribute to changes in intermingling. The total amount of intermingling in resting cells seems to involve a larger amount of chromatin than that in activated cells, given that the relative intermingling (i.e., normalized to nuclear volume) was generally higher. An expansion of the present study involving a larger number of chromosome pairs would be necessary to conﬁrm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, it is tempting to attribute a functional signiﬁcance to this observation, since a decrease in intermingling can be seen as a protective mechanism to prevent chromosome translocations.
