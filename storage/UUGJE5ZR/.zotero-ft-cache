Gaussia princeps Luciferase
Intro Gaussia princeps is the largest copepod that lives in the Hawaiian waters (Image by Microangela). Gaussia luciferase uses coelenterazine and its derivatives (Cat# 20001 to 20003) to catalyse the oxidative decarboxylation of coelenterazine to produce coelenteramide and light. Gaussia luciferase products available: Vectors: 1. pGLuc (Cat# 20101) – pUC19-based plasmid with Gaussia luciferase sequence optimised for expression in bacterial cells 2. pCDNA (Cat# 20106) – pCDNA3-based plasmid with humanised Gaussia luciferase sequence; codon optimised for expression in mammalian cells Recombinant: 1. Gaussia luciferase 45% purity (Cat# 20107 and 20108) – crude preparation, low grade material ideal as a teaching aid. Suggested experiments and protocols are available - please contact us at info@luxbiotech.com Biotinylated: 2. Biotinylated luciferase – 2x brighter than normal Gaussia luciferase for sensitive detection of proteins, DNA, etc. - available alone (Cat# 20109) or as a kit including buffers and coelenterazine (Cat# 20110) (see separate product sheet) pCMV-based Gaussia luciferase products are also available but require approximately three weeks to despatch Technical information: Gaussia princeps luciferase is the smallest luciferase isolated to date. It has a spectral peak at 480 nm (figure 1) It is sodium dependent (figure 2). Similarly to Renilla luciferase it is ATP independent. The specific activity of this luciferase in the presence of high concentrations of 16 coelenterazine (10µM) is extremely high: 1.24 x 10 Qps/mg (Quanta per second per milligram). Gaussia luciferase contains a signal peptide, and the protein is therefore secreted from mammalian cells. The signal peptide does not function in E. coli. Note that benzyl coelenterazine (h-CTZ) is not recommended for use with Gaussia luciferases – use native coelenterazine instead (n-CTZ).

The features of this luciferase include: pH resistance (surviving a pH range of 3-11); Good thermostability (up to 60°C and approx. 20% recovery following a 15 minute incubation at 99°C); Activity even in the presence of non-ionic detergents (1-5% nonionic detergents (NP-40, Triton X-100, Triton X-114, CHAPSO); Resistance to cholate, deoxycholate etc. and ability to recover activity after treatment with 7M guanidine chloride or 8M urea+NP-40; Greater brightness compared to other luciferases. Following transformation of Chinese hamster ovary cells, native Gaussia princeps luciferase gave a 15-fold increased luminescence compared to commercially available Renilla luciferase and 750-fold greater luminescence after human codon optimization (see data below); Peak light output: pH=7.8 in 500 mM NaCl

Effect on luminescent signal with increasing coelenterazine concentration
hGLuc shows higher bioluminescent signal than hRLuc or PlLuc at any giving coelenterazine dose and despite its secretion, the intracellular signal is still 50-fold higher than hRluc in mammalian cells. Tannous et al 2005. Viable cells + conditioned medium hGluc Cell lysate

Activity of different luciferases compared to GLuc in vitro
Humanized Gaussia luciferase is over 1000-fold more sensitive than humanized Renilla or humanized firefly luciferases, and the wild-type Gaussia luciferase shows similar sensitivity as the wild-type Pleuromamma luciferase when all expressed in mammalian cells under similar conditions.

The primers were designed to introduce an EcoRI site at the 5’ end and a XbaI site at the 3’ end of the fragment (shown in italic on the sequence). The 541 bp EcoRI/ XbaI digested PCR product was ligated into similarly linearized pUC19. The underlined ATG is the

first codon of the LUC coding sequence. Six histidine codons were added on the 3’ end of the gene to facilitate purification of protein products.
