Key words. Electro-active polymer (EAP), harmonic excitation light microscopy (HELM), high resolution, structured illumination, wide-field microscopy. Summary Combining total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with structured illumination allows optical wide-field imaging with sub-100-nanometre resolution. We present a novel objective-launch set-up for standing wave illumination that takes advantage of a tunable transmission diffraction grating and transparent phase shifters actuated by electro-active polymers to control the excitation pattern in three dimensions. Image acquisition is completed in less than 1 s. To reconstruct the extended image spectrum, we apply a new apodization function that results in a lateral resolution of 89 nm for green emission wavelength. Introduction Fluorescence microscopy and highly specific labelling of molecules and molecular assemblies have become indispensable tools in cell biology (Taylor & Wang, 1980; Stephens & Allan, 2003). Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is the method of choice for observing structures and processes close to cell surfaces and adjacent to the cover slip or glass slide. Illuminating the specimen with an evanescent wave decaying exponentially in axial direction results in an essentially two-dimensional (2D) image without interference from regions deeper within the sample (Axelrod, 2001). However, for proper analysis, many structures and processes require lateral resolution better than 100 nm. To this end, the resolution of TIRF microscopy needs to be extended beyond the classical diffraction limit. Among the established approaches in high-resolution light microscopy (for overviews, see Gustafsson, 1999; Garini et al., 2005), structured illumination, as suggested by Lukosz & Marchand (1963) and later implemented in standard epifluorescence microscopy (Bailey et al., 1993; Heintzmann

& Cremer 1999; Frohn et al., 2000; Gustafsson, 2000), is particularly well suited for TIRF microscopy since the spatial period of the standing wave illumination pattern can be further reduced in the higher refractive index material of the specimen support (Cragg & So, 2000; So et al., 2001; Chung et al., 2006, 2007). Taking advantage of the non-linear response of fluorophores in the saturation regime (Heintzmann et al., 2002; Gustafsson, 2005), resolution may be improved down to several 10 nm. However, such procedures typically require long acquisition times and may suffer from increased photobleaching and phototoxicity, limiting their application to biological specimens. Hence a technique relying on linear fluorophore response is preferred. In this regime, harmonic excitation light microscopy (HELM), also referred to as standing wave microscopy (Frohn et al., 2000; Gustafsson, 2000), has already proven a resolution enhancement by a factor of two in standard epi-fluorescence, approaching 100 nm in TIRF mode (Chung et al., 2007). Here, we present an easy-to-implement TIRF-HELM set-up achieving sub-100-nm resolution in large area images. In our set-up, tunable optical elements actuated by electro-active polymers (EAP) control a 2D standing wave illumination pattern. A tunable polymeric diffraction grating allows one to vary the spatial period and penetration depth of the excitation light in the object plane, and two adjustable polymeric phase plates shift the illumination pattern laterally. Raw data are processed in a robust algorithm with an apodization function adapted to the extended HELM passband. We demonstrate a full width at half maximum point resolution of 89 nm on fluorescent spheres and further illustrate the dramatic resolution increase on HeLa cells transfected with actin-GFP (green fluorescent protein).

Extended resolution Lateral resolution of diffraction-limited optical systems amounts to δ = λ/2nsin(α ap ), where λ is the excitation

spectrum (open squares) are brought into the passband of the microscope and can be detected, albeit at the wrong position in frequency space. For our 2D excitation pattern (Fig. 1(b)), the resulting fluorescence spectrum is given by the linear combination of five spectral components, kx , k y = 4A + e +i ϕx B+ + e −i ϕx B− + e +i ϕ y C + + e −i ϕ y C − . To reconstruct the extended object spectrum (Fig. 1b), we acquire a sequence of five raw images with the phase ϕx , ϕ y of the illumination pattern set to (0,0; π/2,0; π,0; 0,π/2; 0,π) and apply image arithmetic to determine the spectral components A(k x , k y ), B± (k x , k y ), C± (k x , k y ) as described by Frohn et al. (2000). Alternatively, the phase can be set to (0,0; 2π/3,0; 4π/3,0; 0,2π/3; 0,4π/3) to reduce bleaching effects in long-run experiments. Materials and methods
Fig. 1. (a) Structured illumination creates spectral copies (open squares) of the original spectrum (filled squares) shifted by the vector u out of the centre of the passband (shaded circle). Because of the shifted position of the spectral copies, higher spatial-frequency information (illustrated by smaller squares) is brought into the passband and contributes to image formation.

Microscope set-up Figure 2 illustrates schematically a cross-section of our telecentric TIRF-HELM set-up employing two pairs of interfering laser beams launched symmetrically around the objective’s optical axis to form the 2D structured evanescent light field at the cover slip–specimen interface (for clarity, only one pair of interfering beams is shown). The excitation light is provided by a linearly polarized solid state laser (Sapphire 488– 200, Coherent, λ = 488 nm, 1 W), delivered by a polarization maintaining single mode fibre and collimated to a diameter of 1.1 mm. A convex lens L 0 (f = 100 mm) is used to control the divergence of the Gaussian beam in the object plane. Shifting L 0 along the optical axis allows one to adjust the field of illumination w between 10 and 50 μm in diameter. An electrically tunable polymeric 2D sinusoidal phase grating (Aschwanden et al., 2007) generates two orthogonal pairs of laser beams. To this end, only the first orders of diffraction (±x, ±y) are retained, whereas a diaphragm blocks all other orders. The tunable grating is located in a secondary image plane and allows the diffraction angle to be varied, causing a proportional change of the illumination angle in the specimen plane. One beam of each pair (–x, –y) is directed through an electrically tunable polymeric phase plate to control the position of the illumination pattern in x- and y direction. To obtain two independently interfering beam pairs, half-wave plates turn the polarization of the ±x pair by 90◦ . As a result, both the ±x pair and the ±y pair are s-polarized and are not affected by phase aberrations at the edge of high NA objectives (Inou´ & Kubota, 1958). In practice, we adjust the beam e polarizations by turning the half-wave plates until the crossinterference pattern of (x, y) pairs disappears. The resulting 2D sinusoidal excitation pattern corresponds to a first-order projection of the grating. The four beams enter the inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 M, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) from the side via a coupling unit made of lens L 2 (f = 30 mm) and a 90◦ beam

wavelength in vacuum, n is the index of refraction and α ap the half angle of the system’s aperture. In frequency domain, this limit describes a circle centred at the origin of reciprocal space. Figure 1(a) illustrates a schematic image spectrum (filled squares) together with the passband of the microscope (shaded circle). Only spatial frequencies within the passband contribute to image formation, hence the smallest squares, representing high spatial frequency information, cannot be retrieved in classical light microscopy. In HELM, high spatial frequency information is brought into the passband by illuminating the fluorescent sample with a standing wave pattern formed by two pairs of interfering laser beams. The emitted light φ is given by the density distribution of fluorophores ψ times the excitation intensity I, φ(x, y, z) = ψ(x, y, z)I(x, y, z). In TIRF-HELM, the excitation intensity is described by I(x, y, z) = I 0 e−d/z [2 + cos(u x x + ϕ x ) + cos(u y y + ϕ y )], which is an evanescent wave in axial direction with a 2D cosine modulation laterally. The thickness of this structured light sheet is characterized by the penetration depth d = (l/4π)(n 1 2 sin2 α−n 2 2 )−1/2 , where n 1 and n 2 represent the refractive indices of the cover slip and the specimen, respectively, and α is the angle of incidence of the excitation light at the glass-specimen interface. Harmonic excitation results in additional copies of the image spectrum (open squares in Fig. 1(a)), shifted by the vector u = 2π/ , where = λ/(2n 1 sinα) is the wavelength of the standing wave in the glass substrate. Because of this shift, higher spatial frequencies of the image

Fig. 2. Schematic cross-section of the TIRF-HELM set-up. An electrically tunable 2D sinusoidal phase grating, placed in a secondary image plane, and a diaphragm generate two orthogonal pairs of first-order diffracted beams (only one pair shown for clarity). Lenses L 1 and L 2 project the beam waists into the back focal plane (bfp) of the objective. The position of lens L 0 along the beam axis defines the field of illumination. Two electrically tunable phase plates, one per diffraction pair, shift the position of the standing wave illumination pattern in x- and y direction. One pair of diffracted beams is directed through λ/2 plates to obtain two pairs of orthogonally polarized beams. The left inset shows the beam configuration for total internal reflection; w and w are the beam waist diameters in the object plane and the back focal plane, respectively, r c is the critical radius for total internal reflection, r obj is the radius of the objective exit pupil and α is the angle of illumination. The right inset is a cross-section through the polymeric tunable grating.

deflector (front surface silver-coated prism mirror, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA). This coupling unit replaces the aperture diaphragm slider in the standard epi-illumination unit. L 1 (f = 80 mm) and L 2 ensure that the waists of the four beams are located on a ring in the back aperture plane of the objective (Fig. 2, left inset). To enable TIRF conditions for samples in aqueous medium, the width of the ring is given as d = r obj [1 – (n w /n gl )], where r obj is the radius of the objective exit pupil, n w = 1.33 and n gl = 1.51 are the refractive indices of water and glass, respectively. The inner radius of the ring, r c , corresponds to the critical angle at the onset of total internal reflection. The beam waist w depends on the desired field of illumination w and is given by w = f obj λ/wπ, where f obj is the objective focal length (Self, 1983). Using a Zeiss α Plan-Fluar 100×/1.45 oil objective and selecting the illumination field w = 50 μm requires a focal spot of w = 5.1 μm for a ring width of d = 300 μm. The fluorescence signal collected by the objective is separated from the excitation light by a dichromatic mirror and a bandpass filter (515–565 nm, Filter set 10, Carl Zeiss) and recorded with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA ERG, Hamamatsu). Tunable grating and phase plate The tunable 2D transmission grating is fabricated by micromoulding as described by Aschwanden et al. (2007). A

1-mm-thick acrylic dielectric elastomer tape (VHB 4910, 3M) is pre-stretched (300% × 300%) to a final thickness of 62 μm and mounted on a PMMA frame (Fig. 2, right inset). Compliant carbon black ring electrodes are contact printed using a carbon black–coated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp. This structure forms the actuator. A 15-μm-thick PDMS film (Sylgard 184, 10:1 mixture, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) is spin coated onto a 2D sinusoidal master grating (13500 lines/inch, RainbowSymphony, Reseda, CA, USA) and placed onto the dielectric elastomer actuator. After removing trapped air bubbles in vacuum and curing at 65◦ C, the grating master is peeled off from the thermally bonded PDMS layer. Applying a voltage of 4.5 kV, results in a lateral compression of the grating period by 7.5%. Diffraction efficiency into the first orders amounts to 28% and could be improved by adapting the groove height to blue light. The tunable phase plate is built from just a pre-stretched (300% × 300%) dielectric elastomer film (VHB 4910, 3M) with contact printed compliant carbon black ring electrodes of 4 mm inner diameter and 1 mm width (Fig. 3(a)). Applying a voltage to the ring electrodes induces an electromechanical thickness strain between the electrodes that results in an increase in optical path length over the clear aperture, due to the incompressibility of the elastomer material. Increasing the applied voltage from 0 V to 3.7 kV covers a tuning range of 7 λ at 488 nm (Fig. 3(b)). An offset voltage of U 0 = 2.5 kV is applied

Image processing We determined the precise period and orientation of the excitation pattern from the recorded calibration image. This calibration step was performed whenever a different illumination angle was set. The five fluorescence images were background subtracted and normalized for the reconstruction. Image spectra were compensated by the measured optical transfer function (OTF) of the microscope. Noise amplification was avoided by employing a Wiener filter (Kassam & Lim, 1977) for deconvolution. The additive constant c for the filter is inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We estimated c from the radial mean value of the spectrum divided by its variance c = (|k|) V ar [ (|k|)] in the noise regime outside of the OTF support. Images without this OTF compensation will be referred to as unfiltered images. If c is chosen too small, noise will corrupt the separated spectra with an artefactual peak related to the spatial frequency of the grid pattern. As a result, a grid-like pattern will be superimposed on the final image. To separate the individual spectral components, we solved the linear equation system for each pixel by inverse matrix multiplication. The spectra were shifted back to the origin of frequency space by applying the Fourier shift theorem in real space. The initial phases of the illumination pattern were determined by analyzing the overlap regions of the different spectral components. To this end, we iteratively maximized the correlation coefficient between the complex angles of a finite pixel field. This method minimizes deviations introduced by single amplified noise values. In a next step, all spectral components were superimposed into a single data set to form the extended HELM passband. The sharp edges of the extended passband were smoothed with a function providing constant weighting for regions with high SNR and apodization in a band at the edge of the spectrum. The base of this function was the OTF of TIRF-HELM T (Fig. 4(a)) modelled with an analytical OTF according to Agard (1984) for ease of scaling the base dimensions. Dividing T by itself plus a small constant c T 1, generated a step function θ = T/(T + c T ) of the same base dimensions (Fig. 4(b)). Next, we shrunk θ by 30% and convolved it with a circular Gaussian function. The width of the Gaussian was set to damp the spectrum down to 0.5% at the limit of the TIRFHELM OTF. The resulting apodization function θ Ap is shown in Fig. 4(c). The final TIRF-HELM image was obtained after re-sampling the pixel size from 64 to 16 nm by zero padding of the spectrum and retransforming the data into real space.

to the phase plate for a more linear working range. Each phase plate is calibrated to account for variations in the fabrication procedure. For faster response time, we drive the phase plate with an undershoot pulse (U = 0 V) of 50-ms duration before applying the voltage corresponding to the target phase setting. After a relaxation time of 100 ms, the relative phase drift is <0.02 λ s–1 , stable enough for TIRF-HELM imaging. Specimen preparation HeLa cells transfected with actin-GFP were grown on cover slips, fixed with formaldehyde and mounted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Fluorescent microspheres of nominal diameter 50 nm (Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA) were suspended 1:400 in UHQ water. The solution was (1) mixed with 1% Agarose and mounted between two cover slips or (2) dropped on a cover slip, air dried and re-wetted with water. Image acquisition The field of illumination was adjusted to 50 μm in diameter. In experiments with fixed illumination angle, the period of the standing wave was = 175 nm, corresponding to a theoretical penetration depth of the evanescent field of d = 92 nm. Each acquired data set comprised a calibration image of the illumination pattern imaged with a neutral density filter and without the dichromatic mirror, and five fluorescence images for the different phase settings of the illumination pattern. The sum of these five images will be referred to as conventional image. Total acquisition times were 0.9 s for microsphere specimens and 1.6 s for HeLa cells due to lower fluorescence signal.

Results We first evaluated the performance of our TIRF-HELM setup on a water-wetted preparation of 50-nm fluorescent microspheres. Figures 5(a) and (b) clearly reveal the level of detail accessible with our 2D structured illumination that does

neither require the specimen to be rotated nor any other optical or mechanical component. Comparison with the unfiltered TIRF-HELM image (Fig. 5c) demonstrates the importance of first compensating the five raw images by the microscope’s OTF before reconstructing the extended HELM spectrum. The unfiltered TIRF−HELM image suffers from strong artefacts induced by the anisotropic point-spread-function (PSF) shown in Fig. 6(c). For reference, we include the conventional TIRF image, filtered with the measured OTF of the microscope (Fig. 5(d)) and unfiltered (Fig. 5(e)). To quantify the resolution of our TIRF-HELM system, we evaluated the effective PSF obtained from 50-nm microspheres. To this end, we aligned and averaged the intensity profiles of 20 isolated beads and determined the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resulting signal. Figures 6(a) and (b) illustrate the PSF of conventional unfiltered TIRF microscopy and the reduction in FWHM upon filtering with the microscope’s OTF, respectively. The PSF obtained for the unfiltered TIRF-HELM reconstruction (Fig. 6(c)) exhibits pronounced sidelobes in x- and y direction resulting from the maxima in the extended spectrum

(cf. Fig. 4(a)). Filtering the five raw images with the microscope’s OTF before reconstructing the extended resolution image effectively removes the sidelobes (Fig. 6(d)). Figure 6(e) displays cross sections through the filtered PSFs. For conventional TIRF microscopy (dashed line), we obtain an FWHM of 231 nm, whereas for TIRF-HELM (full line), the FWHM is reduced to 89 nm, which is an improvement by a factor of 2.6. The tunable grating affords continuous control of the illumination angle without mechanical readjustment of the set-up. Hence, the penetration depth of the evanescent wave can be easily changed as documented in Fig. 7 on agarose-embedded microspheres. The penetrations depths indicated correspond to the theoretical predictions for the illumination angles used at the glass–water interface. Angles were determined from the period of the recorded standing wave illumination pattern. To further explore the potential of TIRF-HELM on biological specimens, we recorded 1024 × 1024 pixel images of HeLa cells transfected with actin-GFP. The comparison between conventional TIRF microscopy (Figs. 8(a) & (b)) and

TIRF-HELM (Figs 8(c) & (d)) clearly reveals the dramatic increase in resolution achievable with structured illumination.

Conclusion We presented a novel objective launched TIRF-HELM setup, based on optical elements tuned by dielectric elastomer actuators. For the first time, we introduce these inexpensive polymeric optical elements in light microscopy, demonstrating their versatile properties for optical applications. The electrically tunable diffraction grating and phase shifters accomplish complete control over the illumination pattern such that no mechanical adjustments are necessary during image acquisition. In addition to setting the penetration depth of the evanescent wave, the tunable grating also allows one to easily adjust TIRF conditions for samples with varying effective refractive index. The telecentric set-up with the tunable diffraction grating placed in a secondary image plane requires few adjustment parameters and results in very low drift rates (8.3 nm min–1 ) of the illumination pattern, making feedback control redundant. Light coupling via an aperture slider port also maintains the full functionality of the microscope.
