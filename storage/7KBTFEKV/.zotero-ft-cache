Signalling pathways that mediate skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy
David J. Glass

Atrophy of skeletal muscle is a serious consequence of numerous diseases, including cancer and AIDS. Successful treatments for skeletal muscle atrophy could either block protein degradation pathways activated during atrophy or stimulate protein synthesis pathways induced during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. This perspective will focus on the signalling pathways that control skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, including the recently identified ubiquitin ligases muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx), as a basis to develop targets for pharmacologic intervention in muscle disease.

here are compelling reasons to develop new medicines that can maintain skeletal muscle mass. Profound atrophy is often a consequence of diseases such as cancer and AIDS1. Muscle immobilization, as commonly seen when a limb is put in a cast after an orthopedic injury, causes rapid muscle loss which may require months of physical therapy. The effectiveness of glucocorticoid drugs, such as dexamethasone, are limited by muscle wasting, seen as a side-effect of these agents. Even during normal ageing there is a gradual loss of muscle mass and a diminished capacity to reverse that loss, which results in weakness and morbidity2,3. Currently, there are no safe and effective medicines available to treat muscle atrophy. The rate of protein breakdown increases during atrophy and has been correlated with the activation of cellular proteases, most notably the ATP-dependent ubiquitin proteasome system1,4. One study which suggested that activation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathways caused atrophy made use of inhibitors of the proteasome, which were shown to reduce the rate of proteolysis in atrophying skeletal muscles5. However, it was not known whether there are mediators of protein breakdown that are unique to skeletal muscle or whether more general mechanisms are employed. Whereas atrophy has been associated with increases in protein breakdown, an increase in protein synthesis has been shown to occur during hypertrophy6. This protein synthesis results in the addition of contractile filaments comprising the myofibre, allowing for greater force to be produced by the muscle. Advances in the understanding of signalling pathways that control skeletal muscle mass will be discussed in an effort to highlight how progress in basic science might aid in the identification of novel targets for anti-atrophy drug discovery. Reciprocally, it will be demonstrated that

the particular requirements making a protein useful as a target for clinical intervention spurs research into fundamental problems in cell biology.
IGF-1 An increase in muscle work stimulates the expression of a protein growth factor known as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)7. IGF-1 has been shown to be sufficient to induce hypertrophy through either autocrine or paracrine mechanisms7. IGF-1 expression is increased during compensatory hypertrophy7, caused experimentally by removing several muscles to force those remaining to take up the resultant increase in load. Furthermore, transgenic mice engineered to over-express IGF-1 using a muscle-specific promoter have skeletal muscles that are twofold greater in mass than those seen in normal mice3,8. So, could IGF-1 be developed as a medicine to induce muscle hypertrophy? There are several problems with this approach. The receptor for IGF-1 is ubiquitously expressed, so there is the danger that systemic treatment would affect other tissues. In addition, IGF-1 stimulates proliferation and survival in mitosis-competent cells. Therefore, unless genetic therapy using IGF1 could be developed, selective activation of the IGF-1 pathway in skeletal muscle may require the determination of downstream mediators of IGF-1-induced hypertrophy. The downstream signalling mechanisms induced by IGF-1 that are required for hypertrophy have been a matter of some controversy. It was initially reported that the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin was critical for IGF-1-mediated hypertrophy9,10. Calcineurin was also reported to be required for load-induced hypertrophy11. Other work has focused on the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase PI(3)K/Akt (PKB) pathway downstream of IGF-1, demonstrating that Akt is activated

during hypertrophy and is sufficient to induce hypertrophy12,13. Both the calcineurin pathway and the PI(3)K/Akt pathway will be discussed further below.
Calcineurin and the NFATs Calcineurin is activated by calcium/calmodulin and mediates the dephosphorylation of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) transcription factors14. There are four members of the NFAT family, NFATc1–c4 (ref. 14). After dephosphorylation, NFATs are translocated to the nucleus, resulting in gene transcription. Therefore, dephosphorylation of NFAT and its subsequent translocation have been used to gauge calcineurin activity. There is good reason to consider calcineurin as a potential mediator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy; transgenic animals that express a constitutively active mutant of calcineurin or NFATc3 in cardiac myocytes undergo cardiac hypertrophy15. However, in skeletal muscle the case for calcineurin as a mediator of hypertrophy is less certain. Whereas some groups have reported that cyclosporin A (CsA), a smallmolecule inhibitor of calcineurin, inhibits compensatory hypertrophy11, others have seen no effect3,16,17. These discrepancies could be caused by differences in experimental design; however, in vitro inhibition of calcineurin-mediated nuclear translocation of NFAT using CsA did not result in an inhibition of IGF-1-mediated hypertrophy of myotubes13, and several groups were able to deliver sufficient levels of CsA in vivo so as to inhibit other markers of calcineurin activity in skeletal muscle, and yet inhibition of hypertrophy was not detected3,16,17. The role of calcineurin in skeletal muscle hypertrophy was also assessed by genetic methods. Transgenic mice that expressed a constitutively active form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle did not undergo hypertrophy18,19. Calcineurin activity in the mus87

difficult to produce small-molecule activators of cytoplasmic enzymes; therefore, in cases where activation of an enzyme is desired, a more fruitful approach may be to find those proteins that down-regulate the enzyme of interest and target those inhibitory proteins. In the case of Akt, activity can be controlled by regulating the levels of its lipid-binding site, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which is dephosphorylated by two different types of phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP (for SH2-domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase; there are two mammalian SHIPs, SHIP1 and SHIP2). Overexpression of PTEN results in the inactivation of Akt1 (ref. 26) and a subsequent decrease in cell size27,28. Overexpression of SHIP2 has been shown to inhibit hypertrophy in muscle12,13. A dominant-negative mutant of SHIP2 that activates Akt1 by inhibiting the function of endogenous SHIP2 (ref. 29) causes hypertrophy in skeletal myotubes13. Could PTEN or SHIP2 be useful targets for drug discovery in the search for activators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy? Unfortunately, genetic loss of PTEN results in an increased propensity for cancer through activation of the Akt pathway in cells capable of proliferation30. A knockout mouse of SHIP2 has been generated, but SHIP2−/− animals die soon after birth as a result of hypoglycemia31. It is not clear, however, whether the SHIP2−/− mice are genetically null for SHIP2. Of concern is the fact that the first 18 exons were left intact in these animals. In addition, a phenotype was observed in the SHIP2+/− animals consistent with the possibility that some portion of the protein is being made and is functioning as a dominant-negative molecule; however, data suggested that the SHIP2 mRNA and protein are absent in the knockouts31. Taken at face value, this experiment indicates that SHIP2 might be an attractive target for insulin sensitization in diabetics; however its use as a target for hypertrophy awaits experiments that can discriminate between effects on glucose transport through Akt2 and potential stimulation of protein synthesis through activation of Akt1.
The PI(3)K/Akt/Tsc/mTOR pathway Indications that there was a particular pathway downstream of Akt relevant to the control of cell size came from experiments in Drosophila melanogaster, where loss or inhibition of either PI(3)K32, mTOR33 or p70 S6 kinase34 (p70S6K) resulted in decreases in cell size. These signalling molecules comprise members of a pathway from IRS-1 to p70S6K (Fig. 1). In mammalian cells, the precise pathway connecting PI(3)K to the activation of p70S6K is a matter of some dispute. The Akt1 activator PDK1 can phosphorylate

cles obtained from these transgenic animals increased significantly when compared with normal levels, indicating that activation of this enzyme is not sufficient to induce hypertrophy19. It is perhaps hardest to reconcile the finding that calcineurin activity does not increase during hypertrophy, as might be expected if it were playing a causative role12. Although the sum of the present data does not rule out a role for calcineurin in the hypertrophic response, more work is required to label calcineurin a promising target in this field.
The IGF-1/PI(3)K Pathway Binding of the growth factor IGF-1 induces a conformational change in the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in its trans-phosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). In turn, this results in the activation of PI(3)K (Fig. 1). In mammalian muscle, PI(3)K was implicated as a potential mediator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in experiments where a mutant form of the Ras proto-oncogene that was only competent to activate the PI(3)K pathway was used20; expression of this mutant caused skeletal muscle hypertrophy when directly introduced into muscle and blocked denervation-induced atrophy20, providing early evidence that activation of the PI(3)K pathway was sufficient to mediate the hypertrophic effect of IGF-1 on skeletal muscle. The PI(3)K/Akt pathway Activation of PI(3)K results in the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate,

which provides a membrane-binding site for the serine/threonine kinase Akt21 (Fig. 1). Akt is phosphorylated after translocation to the membrane by the kinase Pdk1 (3′-phoshphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1)21. Once activated, Akt phosphorylates an array of substrates, including proteins that mediate protein synthesis, gene transcription, cell proliferation and survival21. In mammals, there are three forms of Akt, Akt1–3, encoded by distinct genes21. Expression of a constitutively active form of Akt1 in skeletal muscle cells, either in vitro22 or in vivo12,23, causes hypertrophy. The demonstration that Akt1 is activated downstream of PI(3)K stimulation and that Akt1 can recapitulate the hypertrophic effects observed with PI(3)K suggests that these two molecules are components of a linear pathway. Mice that lack Akt1 are smaller than control littermates, supporting a role for Akt1 in cell growth24. Interestingly, deletion of Akt2 results in a distinct phenotype. Akt2−/− animals are resistant to insulin and undergo a diabetes-like syndrome, supporting other experiments that implicate the PI(3)K/Akt pathway in glucose transport25. The distinction between Akt1 and Akt2 function highlights the possibility of selectively activating Akt1 and therefore stimulating protein synthesis without interfering with glucose homeostasis.
Lipid phosphatases that inhibit Akt The demonstration that activation of Akt1 is sufficient to induce hypertrophy mandates consideration of Akt1 as a target for drug discovery. As a practical matter, however, it is

p70S6K directly35, implying that Akt may be dispensable for signalling to p70S6K. However, there are also data that point to Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as FRAP or RAFT-1) as necessary intermediates between PI(3)K and p70S6K (Fig. 1). mTOR was so-named because it is inhibited by a chemical called rapamycin; rapamycin initially binds a protein called FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), and the complex of rapamycin and FKBP inhibits mTOR function23. Akt phosphorylates36 and activates mTOR37, and phosphorylation of both Akt12,23 and mTOR are increased during muscle hypertrophy38. In mouse myotubes, rapamycin blocks both Akt- and IGF-1-mediated activation of p70S6K (refs 13, 23), and this blockade decreases both hypertrophy13 and muscle growth23. Inhibition of mTOR activity with rapamycin blocks compensatory hypertrophy in vivo12. In that same system, rapamycin blocks activation of p70S6K, but not Akt. These data are consistent with the concept that Akt and mTOR are requisite members of a linear signalling pathway upstream of p70S6K (Fig. 1). However, data obtained with rapamycin may not be dispositive, as there may be concerns about the specificity of any chemical agent. Recently, genetic support for a linear pathway came from reports demonstrating that the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) and Tsc2 proteins can inhibit mTOR-mediated signalling. Akt directly phosphorylates Tsc2, activating mTOR in part by inactivating Tsc2 (ref. 39). Presumably, if PDK could circumvent Akt and mTOR, Tsc2-mediated inactivation of mTOR would not be sufficient to block activation of p70S6K downstream of insulin- or serum-mediated stimulation. However, p70S6K and PHAS-1 phosphorylation are inhibited by Tsc2 in insulin- or serum-treated cells39,40. A definitive answer as to whether PDK1 might be sufficient to activate p70S6K in mammalian systems awaits the generation of appropriate genetic mutants. It is also possible that there may be differences in signalling that are dependent on cell context. Activation of mTOR results in an increase in protein translation by two mechanisms: first, mTOR activates p70S6K, a positive regulator of protein translation41; second, mTOR inhibits the activity of PHAS-1 (also known as 4E-BP1), a negative regulator of the protein initiation factor eIF-4E42. Signalling from Drosophila TOR to PHAS-1 was also confirmed genetically in Drosophila42. Thus, a search for targets in this pathway should focus on inhibitors of p70S6K, or whether it is possible to directly block the activity of PHAS-1.
β The PI(3)K/Akt/GSK3β pathway Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is another substrate of Akt that has been

shown to mediate hypertrophy. Phosphorylation of Akt results in the inactivation of GSK3β44. Therefore, expression of a dominant-negative form of GSK3β is a way to mimic Akt activity. This dominantnegative form of GSK3β has been shown to induce hypertrophy in skeletal myotubes13. GSK3β might be an attractive target for drug discovery because inhibition of this kinase produces the desired effect. However, there is the concern that inhibition of GSK3β would have pleiotropic effects, as it has multiple substrates and is expressed in multiple tissues. However, it will still be interesting to perform the experiment.
β2 adrenergic receptor It is difficult to point to modulators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy downstream of the PI(3)K/Akt pathway whose expression is specific to muscle; those rare candidates may be difficult to target pharmacologically. Therefore, one may need to look for receptors other than the ubiquitously expressed IGF-1 receptor that signal through the PI(3)K/Akt pathway and have a more restricted expression pattern. For example, agonists of the β2-adrenergic receptor, such as clenbuterol, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy and block atrophy45. Most of the β adrenergic receptor signalling studies have focused on activation of cAMP pathways mediated by the Gαs protein. However, it was reported that the Gβ/γ proteins activate the PI(3)K/Akt pathway46. It is therefore of interest to know whether an agent such as rapamycin would inhibit the hypertrophic effects of clenbuterol. Clenbuterol and related compounds could be used to block skeletal muscle atrophy if not for their effects on the circulatory system; stimulation of the β2 adrenergic receptor induces changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and so far these effects have been inseparable from their hypertrophic effects on skeletal muscle. Ubiquitin ligases Perhaps the most direct strategy for identifying useful anti-atrophy targets is to determine the signalling pathways that are required for atrophy. The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in skeletal muscle atrophy has been previously established. For example, inhibitors of the proteasome block increases in protein breakdown normally seen in atrophy5, the level of ubiquitinated conjugates increase during atrophy47 and genes that encode various components of the ubiquitin pathway increase during atrophy48,49. Although there was little basis to expect that musclespecific mediators of atrophy would be found, especially given the ubiquitous

expression of the cytoplasmic proteins that induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy, a search for markers of the atrophy process identified two genes that are up-regulated in multiple models of skeletal muscle atrophy and are expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The two genes are called MuRF1 (ref. 50; for muscle ring finger protein 1) and MAFbx50 (for muscle atrophy F-box protein, also called Atrogin1 (ref. 49). Both genes encode ubiquitin ligases, proteins that bind and mediate ubiquitination of specific substrates. MuRF1−/− and MAFbx−/— mice have been generated50. Under normal conditions, these animals appear to be phenotypically identical to wild-type littermates. After muscle denervation, however, significantly less muscle mass is lost in both MuRF1−/− and MAFbx−/− animals, by comparison to denervated control animals50. MuRF1 has been shown to bind the giant sarcomeric protein titin51 and overexpression of MuRF1 disrupts the portion of titin that was shown to bind MuRF1, suggesting that MuRF1 regulates the stability of this large structural protein52. If MuRF1 ubiquitinates structural components of the sarcomere, this would provide a clear mechanism for how MuRF1 might mediate skeletal muscle atrophy. The genetic demonstration that MuRF1 and MAFbx are required for skeletal muscle atrophy identifies them as potential targets for drug discovery. Unlike some of the other signalling components, MuRF1 and MAFbx fit the criteria for small-molecule drug targets for several reasons. First, their enzymatic activity seems to be required for muscle atrophy; second: they are expressed specifically by muscle cells; third, they do not seem to be required for normal muscle growth or function. Ongoing work is aimed at determining whether the muscle that is preserved in the knockout animals maintains a normal functional capacity.

Conclusion Significant progress has been made in the understanding of signalling pathways that induce both skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, pointing to potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention. Activation of the PI(3)K/Akt pathway has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to induce hypertrophy and to block skeletal muscle atrophy. Akt mediates its hypertrophic effects at least in part by stimulating protein synthesis pathways downstream of mTOR and GSK3β. In addition, the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx have been found to be essential for muscle atrophy. Thus, cytoplasmic proteins in both the Akt and the ubiquitin pathways may potentially serve as clinical targets. Also, the potent hypertrophic effects of both IGF-1 and clenbuterol make the search for useful

muscle-restricted receptors attractive. The demonstration that the muscle-specific genes MAFbx and MuRF1 are upregulated in multiple models of skeletal muscle atrophy helps to suggest that atrophy is not simply the converse of hypertrophy. Although there are apparently muscle-specific atrophy pathways, during hypertrophy more general protein synthesis pathways are strongly upregulated. It is of interest to determine whether atrophy and hypertrophy pathways communicate with each other. If so, and if one pathway can dominantly suppress the other, then this would help in the search for the primary control mechanism of the atrophy process. It is critical to continue studying the cellular pathways mediating skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy to discover promising targets for the development of effective new treatments for skeletal muscle disease.
