Seeding MCF-10A cells in Matrigel
1) Make bed of Matrigel in 8 wells of chamber slide You will need enough Matrigel for 8 wells Matrigel will be pre-thawed on ice (at least 20 min before use) 45ul X 10 (8 wells plus 2 extra wells for pipetting error) = 450ul You will be given 1 ml aliquot Coat each well as described in demo by Grace and Eva Place in 37oC CO2 incubator for at least 30 minutes 2) Trypsinize cells You will be given a confluent 10 cm culture dish with MCF-10A cells These will be used to seed single cells in the 8-well chamber slide Aspirate medium Wash with 10 ml PBS Add 900ul of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA Incubate at 37oC for about 30 minutes 3) Make overlay medium while trypsinizing cells Will need 400ul/well Make 400ul X10 for 8 wells (+ 2 extra) – need 4 ml total Per well 400ul of Assay Media 8ul of EHS (2% final) 0.2ul of 10ug/ml EGF (5ng/ml final) X 10 wells 4 ml Assay media 80ul EHS 2ul EGF(10ug/ml stock)

Original stock of EGF is 100 ug/ml – it will be given to you as a 1:10 dilution, i.e. 10ug/ml. 4) Harvest trypsinized cells Resuspend in 5 ml of resuspension medium Spin cells at 900 rpm for 3 min Aspirate and resuspend in 1 ml of assay medium Pipette up and down with a 1ml tip to generate single cell mix (at least 5-10times) Add 7 ml assay medium and mix completely with a 10ml pipet Count cells (will be close to 1 million cells/ml) Calculate cells needed for 10 wells (8 wells plus 2 extra): 6000 cells per well – 60,000 for 10 wells Add 60,000cells to 4ml of pre-made overlay medium in step3 Mix completely 5) Add 400ul very carefully to each well with Matrigel bed 6) Incubate at 37oC
