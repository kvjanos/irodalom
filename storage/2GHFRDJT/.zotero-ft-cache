Good & Bad Aspects
Homotopy equivalence: Preserves topological structure of domains. Compact representation (graph structure): Easy to store and process in computer. Wide range of applications (Shape Analysis) pattern recognition, computer vision, computer graphics, CAGD, mechanical engineering, biological/medical applications Problems: Difﬁcult to compute Sensitive to noise Poor mathematical analyses so far

Pathological Shapes
MA (MAT) can exhibit pathological behaviours even for domains with C ∞ boundary.

Normal Domain
Ω: compact & connected in R2 is a normal domain, if ∂Ω: ﬁnite number of simple closed curves each boundary component: ﬁnite number of real analytic curve pieces. (Paciﬁc. J. Math. 1997) Ω: a normal domain. =⇒
Theorem

MA(Ω) and MAT(Ω) have ﬁnite graph structures. MA(Ω) is a strong deformation retract of Ω. ♣ Almost every domain in applications is normal.

Generic Points – 2D
G(Ω): the set of MA points with two contact points MA(Ω) except for ﬁnitely many points

Independence of Approximations
Corollary
Let Ω be a pseudonormal 3D domain, and let Ω1 and Ω2 be two weakly injective 3D domains such that max {H(Ωi , Ω), H(∂Ωi , ∂Ω)} ≤ for i = 1, 2. Let θ = min {θΩ1 , θΩ2 }. Then we have H (MAT(Ω1 ), MAT(Ω2 )) ≤ H (MA(Ω1 ), MA(Ω2 )) ≤ 2g(θ) · + o( ), 2g(θ) · + o( ).

General Case of Normal Domains
(VMV 2001) Let Ω be a normal domain (2D) which is not weakly injective. Then we have H(MA(Ω)|MA(Ω ))

Conclusions – Instability
Analyzed quantitatively the effect of boundary perturbation on MAT (weakly injective). Proved the stability of MAT under one-sided Hausdorff distance. Introduced the indicators θΩ , KΩ , NΩ for level of detail. Suggested a new pruning strategy with error analysis.
Problems:

Systematic method for approximation Too large bounds : bounds for speciﬁc applications, introduction of probability measure Other distances : topological information, normal information

Directions
Extension to 3D shape, algorithm, instability need deeper mathematics : differential geometry, (real) algegraic/analytic geometry, differential topology, singularity theory, etc. Relation with Subdivision Real-world applications
