Supplemental Experimental Procedures Antibodies Primary antibodies were from the following sources: Rb anti-Alfy (as previously described(Simonsen et al., 2004)); Ms anti-GFP (Clontech Laboratories, Roche), Rb anti-GFP (Abcam, Novus); Ms anti-FLAG (Sigma); Ms anti-tubulin (Sigma); Ms anti-myc (9E10 hybridoma, ATCC); Gt anti-Atg5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Rb anti-APG5L (Abgent, Abcam); Rb anti-ATG7 (Abcam), Ms (B&D Transduction Labs), GP or Rb-SQSTM1/p62 (Abgent); Ms anti-NBR1 (Abnova); Ms anti-htt (Chemicon MAB5492, MAB5490, MABEM48); Rb anti-Dnmt (Stressgen); Rb anti-Atg16L (Proscience); Rb anti-LC3B (Abcam (WB), gift from T. Yoshimori (WB), gift from R. Kopito (IF)). HRP-labeled secondary antibodies were from Pierce. Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cell Culture HeLa cell cultures were maintained as recommended by American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,VA). HeLa cells stably expressing a tet-off inducible exon1 of Htt carrying a polyQ expansion of 25,65 or 103 residues, fused to monomeric enhanced CFP at the COOH termini (Htt 25Q,65Q- and 103Q-mCFP) were cultured as described and 100 ng/ml doxycyclin (dox) was used to shut off production of new protein. HEK cells stable expressing GFP-LC3 was generously provided by Sharon Tooze. Human HD fibroblasts were obtained from Corriell and maintained as instructed. Immuno Electron Microscopy Cells for immuno EM were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, scraped in 1% gelatin, pelleted and further embedded in 10% gelatin. After infusion with 2.3 M sucrose samples were mounted on silver pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut at −110°C on a Leica Ultracut and picked up with a 1:1 mixture of 2.3 M sucrose and 2.0 M methyl cellulose. Sections were labeled with a rabbit antibody against GFP (a gift from T. Johansen, Tromsø), followed by 10-nm protein A gold (CMC, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and observed in a JEOL-1230 electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 60–80 kV. Images were recorded with a Morada digital camera using iTEM (Olympus SIS GmbH, Münster, Germany) software. Samples for plastic embedding were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 2% OsO4, stained with Uranyl acetate and embedded in Epon after dehydration in alcohol series. Cell Fractionation and Cryo-Electron Microscopy Nycodenz and Metrizamide cell fractionation methods were performed as previously described (Jeong et al., 2009). Briefly, Htt103QmCFP cell lines were mechanically disrupted and were fractionated using a discontinuous Nycodenz gradient (Stromhaug et al., 1998) or 50% Metrizamide gradient (Marzella et al., 1982). Isolated fractions were then examined by immunoblotting or cryo-EM. For cryo-EM, organelles were imaged in vitreous ice over open holes on a perforated carbon support to preserve all details in the image. Samples were imaged on a Tecnai 20 FEG electron microscope operating at 200 kV, with magnifications from 25,000 to 50,000 and a typical defocus of -3.5 μm. Filter-Trap Assay Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL and insoluble material was collected by sentrifugation. The pelleted material was treated with DNAse and then solubilized in 2% SDS. The SDS fraction was applied to a dot-blot apparatus containing a cellulose acetate membrane with pore size 0.2µm (Whatman plc, Maidstone,UK) which traps the SDS-insoluble aggregates. To analyze the effect of siRNA treatment on soluble Htt (IGEPAL-soluble fraction) this fraction was analyzed by SDS page and western blotting. The total protein load was normalized to the volume of the soluble fraction. The protein concentration was measured by the DC protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). An antiGFP antibody was used to detect htt25Q/65Q/103QmCFP. The intensities of the different dots obtained were quantified using the software provided by the ChemiGenius imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). 9

Plasmids Construction The following pDEST-Alfy constructs were made by subcloning the indicated Alfy amino acid fragments into pENTR vectors, followed by an LR reaction using pDEST–Tomato or pDEST-Cherry according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Gateway™ system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); pDESTCherry-Alfy3434-3526, pDEST-Tomato-Alfy2285-3526, pDEST-Tomato-Alfy2285-2982, pDEST-TomatoAlfy2981-3526 and pDEST-Tomato-Alfy1-1271. pDEST-HttQ68-Flag have been described (Bjorkoy et al., 2005). pcDNA-myc-Alfy1-1271 and pcDNA-myc-Alfy2543-3527 were generated by subcloning of the indicated Alfy fragments, generated by PCR, into pcDNA-myc (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pGAD-GHAlfy3434-3526, pGAD-GH-Alfy3068-3526 and pGAD-GH-Alfy2700-3526 were generated by subcloning of the indicated PCR-amplified Alfy fragments in frame with the Gal4 activation domain of pGAD-GH (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). hAtg5 was amplified by PCR from the Marathon Ready human brain cDNA (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) and subcloned in frame with pcDNA 3-myc (Raiborg et al., JCS 2001) or with the DNA-binding domain of pLexa/pBTM116 (Vojtek et al, 1993). Human Atg5, LC3-B or Syntaxin-7 were amplified by PCR from the Marathon Ready human brain cDNA (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) and subcloned into pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia,Buckinghamshire,UK). Amino acids 2887-3526 of human Alfy was subcloned into pMALc2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Transfection of Small-Interfering RNA (siRNA) Oligonucleotides and Plasmids HeLa and HttPolyQ-mCFP cells were transfected with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool small interfering RNAs (siRNA) (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) against human Alfy (WDFY3), Atg7 and Beclin1. Results were confirmed by the use of single siRNA against Alfy (Simonsen et al., 2004a) and one single siRNA from the SMARTpool, having the sequence 5'-GGAAAUGCUCCGCCGAAUAUU-3' of the sense strand and 5'-PUAUUCGGCGGAGCAUUUCCUU-3' of the antisense strand. Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (Bache et al., 2003). Briefly, the cells were transfected with 50-100 nM siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 d, the cells were then re-plated and left for another 2 d before experiments were carried out. Specific protein knockdown was demonstrated by running equal amounts of cell lysate on SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting using antibodies against Alfy. Knock-down was also confirmed by RT-PCR. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the Fugene transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and were cultured for 48 h to allow protein expression. Cells were then fixed on coverslips for confocal analyses or lysed for protein detection assays. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis Immunoprecipitation of Atg5 with C-terminus Alfy (Fig 2b): Cells were harvested and lysed in NP40 buffer (125 mM KAc, 25 mM Hepes at pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgAc, 0.5 % NP40 and 1mM DTT) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The total cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody at 4°C for 10-12 h. After addition of protein A/G agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences), the incubation was continued for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted with SDS loading buffer by boiling for 5 min. Immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of Alfy-htt complex. Cells were lysed with ice cold lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail. Collected lysates were spun at 500xg to pellet unlysed cells and nuclei, then immunoprecipitated as follows: HttPolyQ-mCFP cell lines and exon1htt72Q were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP Magnabeads (Miltenyi Biotec). To analyze the cellular levels of different proteins, cells were first extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 + protease and phosphatase 10

inhibitor cocktails), centrifuged (14000 rpm) for 10 minutes and the supernatants collected. Protein concentrations in the soluble fractions were determined and approximately 20 μg of protein per sample was loaded and resolved on 4-20% gradient gels (Pierce, Rockford, IL) followed by electro blotting to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The blots were probed with specific antibodies, which were detected using standard ECL reagents. The intensities of the different bands obtained were quantified using the software provided by the ChemiGenius imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and relative amounts quantified using tubulin as a loading control. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy HeLa cells grown on coverslips, transfected or not with the indicated siRNA or plasmid, were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin and stained for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (Simonsen et al., 1998). Coverslips were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope equipped with a Neo-Fluar 100x/1.45 oil immersion objective. Image processing and analysis were done with Zeiss LSM 510 software version 3.2, and Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For siRNA transfected stable cell lines, images were collected on the InCell Analyzer 3000 and analysed with the Raven software as previously described (Yamamoto et al., 2006). Transiently transfected cells and primary neuron were examined using a Leica confocal microscope. Analyses was performed on accompanying software and NIH Image. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted from 5x105 HeLa cells using the AurumTM Total RNA mini kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purity and quantity were measured by optical density. 1 μg total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit (BioRad). Real-time PCR was performed in parallel 20 μl reactions containing 10 μl 2x QuantiTectTM SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, CA, USA), 2 μl 10x QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen) and 20 ng cDNA (2 ng were used for actin) in 96-well optical plates. The cycling conditions for the LightCycler480 (Roche) were 95oC for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94oC 15 sec, 55oC 20 sec and 72oC 20 sec. The following pre-validated QuantiTect Primer Assays (Qiagen) were used; Hs_WDFY3_1_SG, Hs_ACTB_1_SG, Hs_TBP_1_SG. Real-time efficiencies were calculated from the slopes of the standard dilution curves. mRNA levels were determined by the method of direct comparison of C T values (C T > 35 rejected) and relative quantities calculated by the ΔΔCT equation or transformed into linear form by . Transcripts were normalized to the quantity of Actin and TBP for each condition. Purification of GST and MBP Fusion Proteins GST, GST-Atg5, GST-LC3 and GST-Syntaxin-7 and MBP-AlfyCT639 were produced in E.coli BL-21. The bacteria were lysed with B-per extraction reagent (Pierce) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mM DTT for 30 min at RT. Lysates containing GST-fusion proteins were incubated with pre-washed Glutathione SepharoseTM (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) for 30 min at RT. The beads were added to a column and washed with buffer A (20mM Tris, 60mM NaCl, pH=7,6, 1 mM DTT). Bound GSTfusion proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10mM reduced glutathione and dialysed in 20mM Hepes, 140mM NaCl, pH=7,2. Lysate containing MBP-AlfyCT639 was incubated with pre-washed Amylose Resin (New England BioLabs) on a column. The resin was washed with buffer B (20 mM Tris pH. 7,5, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT with protease inhibitors) and the protein eluted with buffer B containing 10mM maltose. Eluted protein was dialyzed in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. GST Pulldown Assay 5 µg of GST, GST-Atg5, GST-LC3 or GST-Syntaxin-7 were immobilized on pre-washed Glutathione SepharoseTM (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB). The beads were washed with buffer K (125 mM KAc, 25mM Hepes, 2.5 mM MgAc, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) and incubated with 1 µg of MBP-AlfyCT639 for 2.5 h at 4oC. The beads were washed 3 times with buffer K and once with buffer K lacking NP-40 and then boiled in 2x sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, 11

transfered to a PVDF membrane and bound MBP-AlfyCT639 was detected using western blotting with an anti-Alfy antibody. 15 ng MBP-AlfyCT639 was loaded as a control. Yeast Two-Hybrid Analysis The yeast reporter strain L40 (Vojtek et al., 1993) was cotransformed with pLexa-hAtg5 and the indicated pGAD-Alfy plasmids using a standard lithium acetate method. Selection of transformed yeast was done on DOB-agar plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. A positive interaction was scored by measuring β-galactosidase activities of duplicate transformants, as previously described (Guarente et al., 1982) The data obtained from 4 independent experiments are presented as mean±SEM. Alternatively, freshly transformed colonies were streaked on DOB-agar plates lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine and were grown for 2-3 days at 30°C. Proteasome Assay Proteasome activity was analyzed using the Proteasome-GloTM Cell-based assay (Promega, Madison, WI), which measures the chymotrypsin-like protease activity associated with the proteasome complex, according to the manufactures’ instruction. Briefly, HeLa cells (5x103) were seeded in 96 wells white walled plate on the last day of siRNA transfection. The cells were exposed for 10 min to the Proteasome-GloTM reagent and the chymotrypsin-like protease activity was measured using the GloMax™ 96 Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Drosophila Lines and Genetic Crosses Flies were cultured and maintained on standard cornmeal-molasses-yeast medium and lines obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (flybase.bio.indiana.edu). The EP(2)2299 (UAS-EP-bchs, bchs4) allele was from the Rörth P-element collection that contains a UAS-P-element construct insertion that allows Gal4-driven expression of the full-length Bchs protein. The UAS-bchs-C1000 P-element construct was generated from an EcoR1 cDNA fragment containing the C-terminal 1000 amino acids of Bchs, cloned in to the pUAST vector (Brand and Perrimon, 1993), using a linker sequence encoding a start methionine. This region of Bchs/Alfy contains the BEACH, WD40 and FYVE domains. The UAS-PolyQ127 line was a gift from Dr. Seymour Benzer (California Institute of Technology, CA) and was genetically recombined on to the same chromosome as the GMR-Gal4 driver. This line was crossed as a single unit with different UAS lines. Crosses were maintained at 25°C and F1 progeny scored for modification of eye pigmentation, size, shape, surface texture and necrosis. Representative digital eye images were taken with a Leica MZ6 dissection microscope and Nikon Coolpix 990 camera system and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and Canvas 8.0 imaging software.
