La

Autophagy, a tightly regulated process responsible for the bulk degradation of most long-lived proteins and some organelles, is associated with several forms of human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disease and cardiomyopathies. However, the molecular machinery involved in autophagy in mammalian cells remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform, based on an automated fluorescence microscopy system, which enables acquiring and quantitatively analyzing images of GFP-LC3 dots in cotransfected cells. From a library of 1,050 human cDNA clones, we identified three genes (TM9SF1, TMEM166 and TMEM74) whose overexpression induced high levels of autophagosome formation. In particular, overexpression of TM9SF1, which colocalized with LC3 according to the confocal assay, led to a significant increase in the number of GFP-LC3 dots. The results of transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting to examine LC3-II levels further confirmed the ability of TM9SF1 to induce autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of TM9SF1 expression by RNA interference could hamper starvation-induced autophagy. The functional screening platform therefore can be applied to high-throughput genomic screening candidate autophagy-related genes, which would provide new insights into underlying molecular mechanisms that may regulate autophagy in mammalian cells.

and is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes.1-3 Autophagy is associated with neurodegenerative disease, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections.4 There are three primary forms of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy.5 Macroautophagy is considered the most prevalent form of autophagy. During macroautophagy (referred to as ‘autophagy’ hereafter), a cup-shaped structure called the preautophagosome engulfs cytosolic components, including organelles, and closes to form an autophagosome (also known as an ‘autophagic vesicle containing undegraded cytoplasm’) that subsequently fuses with a lysosome to form an autolysosome, leading to the proteolytic degradation of the internal components of the autolysosome by lysosomal enzymes.5 Autophagy has been investigated extensively in yeast, and because of the generation of autophagy-specific mutants in a variety of yeast cell lines, a number of yeast genes involved in autophagy (called ‘ATG’ genes) have been identified through genetic screens.6 In mammalian, although some homologues of yeast ATG genes have been identified and remarkable progress have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in mammalian autophagy, there are still many questions remained to be answered.5,7 Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a homologue of yeast Atg8 (Aut7/Apg8), is considered a highly specific marker of autophagosomes.8,9 Expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with LC3 (GFP-LC3) and endogenous LC3-II/LC3-I has been used extensively as a specific and sensitive autophagosomal marker used to monitor autophagic activity.7 Until now, the GFP-LC3 autophagic marker has never been used in highthroughput assays to identify genes that regulate autophagy due to technical issues associated with the quantification of GFP-LC3 structures in large numbers of samples. Here we demonstrate that the GFP-LC3 structures can be identified and quantified using an automated approach for microscopic data acquisition and analysis using a high-throughput approach.

High-throughput functional screening for autophagy-related genes and identification of TM9SF1 as an autophagosome-inducing gene

High-throughput screening for autophagy-related genes

Results
Identification of three candidate genes that induce increased numbers of GFP-LC3 dots. To identify human genes involved in autophagy, we screened 1,050 genes of unknown function from our cDNA library using GFP-LC3 as a marker for autophagosomes (Fig. 1A, Suppl. Table 1). We evaluated the ability of candidate genes to induce autophagy according to the number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell. Cells cotransfected with the empty library vector and the GFP-LC3 vector with and without starvation induction served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell was 0.53 ± 0.14 in negative control (unstarved) cells. For most cDNAs screened, the average number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell was very low (≤1.0 for 87.0% of the cDNAs screened). However, the average number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell increased to 2.65 ± 0.43 after starvation induction. Overexpression of three genes (TM9SF1, TMEM166 and TMEM74) led to an increased number of GFP-LC3 dots (up to 2.0 per cell; Fig. 1C and D). The function of the three identified genes (TM9SF1, TMEM166 and TMEM74) was further confirmed by carrying out three independent experiments (data not shown). TM9SF1-overexpressed HeLa cells contain higher numbers of autophagic and acidic vesicles. Transmission electron microscopic analysis, which is the primary and universally accepted method for the detection of autophagy,7 showed that TM9SF1-overexpressed and starving HeLa cells contained extensive numbers of typical autophagic vesicles relative to control cells (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the results of our TEM studies provided additional evidence confirming the ability of TM9SF1 to induce autophagosome production. Furthermore, TM9SF1 overexpression led to increased levels of MDC staining, which is a marker of acid vesicles, in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). MDC was previously considered a marker for autophagic vacuoles, since it was shown to accumulate in acidic compartments enriched in lipids.15 However, MDC is no longer considered a specific marker for autophagic vacuoles, because MDC stains acidic cell compartments.16,17 The increased levels of MDC staining indicate that TM9SF1 overexpression induces the formation of acidic vesicles in HeLa cells, which may correspond to acidic autophagic vacuoles or lysosomes.

In an effort to identify human genes involved in the induction of autophagy, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform based on an automated fluorescence microscopy system, that enables acquiring and quantitatively analyzing images of GFP-LC3 dots in cotransfected cells. From a library of 1,050 human cDNA clones, we identified three genes (TM9SF1, TMEM166 and TMEM74) whose overexpression led to increased numbers of GFP-LC3 dots in the initial screen, which were validated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of autophagosome formation and by immunoblot analysis of LC3-II upregulation. Collectively, our data suggest that the genes are likely to play a significant role in autophagy induction. The screening platform we developed for the identification of autophagy-related genes based on automated fluorescence imaging can be applied readily for high-throughput genomic screening using a 384-well plate format or a cellular array, which would facilitate the identification of novel mammalian autophagy-associated genes and the elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms involved in autophagy induction.

TM9SF1 overexpression leads to increased LC3-II levels in HeLa cells. We found that TM9SF1-transfected HeLa cells showed both an increase in the amount of LC3-II and an increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, TM9SF1 overexpression also led to both an increase in the amount of GFP-LC3-II and an increase in the GFP-LC3-II/ GFP-LC3-I ratio (Fig. 2C); this was consistent with our previous results demonstrating that TM9SF1 overexpression led to an increased number of GFP-LC3 dots and confirmed that TM9SF1 overexpression induces autophagosome formation. Previous studies showed that mutation of glycine at position 120 prevents the C-terminal cleavage and the conjugation of LC3 to the autophagosomal membranes.9 We found that TM9SF1 overexpression has no direct effect on aggregate of GFP-LC3(G120A), and GFP-LC3(G120A) was evenly distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 3A). This identified that TM9SF1 overexpression induces conversion of GFP-LC3-I into GFP-LC3-II but not the aggregation of GFP-LC3 and the puncta are autophagosome-dependent. We also found that lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 could significantly increase the dots of GFP-LC3 in TM9SF1 overexpressed HeLa cells compared with vector overexpressed HeLa cells treated with Bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 3B). The progression of the autophagy is sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin. We further found that wortmannin could partially inhibit the increment of GFP-LC3 dots caused by TM9SF1 (Fig. 3C). These results collectively show that TM9SF1 expression triggers autophagy in HeLa cells. TM9SF1 localizes to autophagic vacuoles and lysosome in HeLa cells. The subcellular localization of proteins is critical to their biological function. Therefore, we determined the subcellular localization of TM9SF1 using confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). We found that TM9SF1-GFP colocalized completely with a DsRed fusion of LC3 (DsRed-LC3), which is associated specifically with autophagic vacuoles. With the treatment of Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar proton ATPase, TM9SF1 still partially colocalized with DsRed-LC3, indicating that TM9SF1 partially localized to the autophagosome. Furthermore, TM9SF1-GFP also colocalized extensively with LTR, which is a sensitive lysosomal/ autolysosomal marker. In addition, TM9SF1 also can colocalize with lysosomal marker LAMP-1. TM9SF1-GFP did not colocalize with the mitochondrial marker MTR. In a proteomic analysis of lysosomal integral membrane proteins by Bagshaw et al.18 TM9SF1 was found to localize in lysosome, which was consistent with our results. Taken together with the results of our earlier studies, the localization of TM9SF1 to autophagic vacuoles and lysosome supports a role for TM9SF1 in autophagy induction. Knockdown of TM9SF1 endogenous expression reduces levels of starvation-induced autophagy. To further determine the role of TM9SF1 in autophagy under physiological conditions, siRNA was designed to knockdown the expression of TM9SF1 in HeLa cells. Nonsilencing siRNA or siRNA against TM9SF1 (si-TM9SF1) was transfected into HeLa cells alone or combined with the TM9SF1-GFP vector. At 48 h after transfection, TM9SF1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in cells transfected with si-TM9SF1, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A), RT-PCR and western blotting (Fig. 5B). To investigate whether si-TM9SF1 transfected HeLa cells have impact on general lysosomal function,

we detected two major lysosomal proteinases. The result showed no difference in the cathepsin D and acid phosphatase enzymatic activity between nonsilencing and si-TM9SF1 transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 5C). Further, we evaluated whether si-TM9SF1 treatment could inhibit starvation-induced autophagy. HeLa cells transfected with nonsilencing siRNA or si-TM9SF1 were induced by starvation for 2 h to promote autophagy. As illustrated in Figure 5D and E, si-TM9SF1 could inhibit both overexpressed GFP-LC3-II and endogenous LC3-II levels in starved HeLa cells. Furthermore, rescue assay showed knockdown-resistant gene can suppress the defect of the si-TM9SF1 and induce autophagy.

transfected HeLa cells was also significantly increased compared with si-TM9SF1 transfected cells. These data suggest that TM9SF1 plays a key role in the regulation of cell autophagy.

Discussion
Cellular based large-scale screens have played important roles in elucidating the functions of human genes in a variety of cell signal pathways and in diverse cellular processes.19-21 Autophagy is associated with many forms of human diseases.4 However, many of the mammalian genes involved in autophagy remain unidentified and studies to monitor autophagy in mammalian cells have only been performed on a small scale.7-9,22,23 Therefore, it is necessary

High-throughput screening for autophagy-related genes

to establish a platform suitable for large-scale functional screening mammalian genes involved in autophagy. There are varieties of autophagy detection methods being used in higher eukaryotes, such as quantitative electron microscopy, LC3 and TOR and p62 western blotting, GFP-LC3 and tandem RFP-GFP fluorescence microscopy, and turnover of long-lived proteins, etc.24,25 However, many of them are time-consuming and labored. LC3 was identified as a specific and convenient autophagic marker in mammalian cells, and GFP-LC3 was recommended for use in high-throughput functional screens to target autophagy.8,9 Examination of GFP-LC3 localization is relatively simple, and requires only a high-resolution fluorescence microscope.

to use GFP-LC3 in a high-throughput fluorescence microscopybased screen, a platform must be established for automated image capture and analysis. Automated fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis technologies have developed rapidly and have been widely applied in several high-throughput cell image-based screens in recent years.19,26 A number of commercial instruments and software are available from well-known companies including Cellomics, Molecular Devices, Axon, Q3DM and GE Health Care.27 Here, we developed an assay to measure autophagy using automated fluorescence microscopy imaging with 96-well plates and an automated fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss, Germany) controlled by “scan multiwell plate” and “auto focus” commands

dots or of increasing levels of LC3-II, strictly speaking, does not necessarily correspond to autophagic degradation. Therefore, the autophagy-related genes we identified based on the number of GFP-LC3 dots are considered autophagosome-inducing genes, but not necessarily autophagy-induced genes. Further experimentation, including assays to determine LC3-II turnover suggested by Isei Tanida, will be required to validate the exact roles of the “hits” with respect to autophagy.28 The three initial “hits” from our GFP-LC3-based screen, including TM9SF1, TMEM166 and TMEM74, were validated using independent methods to detect autophagy, including TEM, LC3 immunoblot analysis, and MDC staining. TMEM166 (transmembrane protein 166, also known as FLJ13391) was first identified as a novel gene associated with cell viability in our lab.10 In our autophagy screen and apoptosis assays, TMEM166 was identified as a novel regulator involved in both autophagy and apoptosis.29

TMEM74 (transmembrane protein 74) was first identified as a regulator of cell death in a previous study from our lab, and its role in autophagy has been further studied by Dr. Yu in our lab.30 TM9SF1 (transmembrane 9 superfamily member 1, NM_006405.5), also called MP70, is a nine-spanning transmembrane protein first cloned in 1997.29 TM9SF1 expression is ubiquitous in human tissues, and it is widely expressed and highly conserved among yeast, plants and mammals.31 It was reported that TM9SF1 could be induced by the neurotoxin 6-OHDA in a model of Parkinson’s disease in PC12 cells.32 In a recent study of identification tumor-associated antigens,31 TM9SF1 was overexpressed in tumors at levels 5.20 times higher than in normal breast tissue. The same study demonstrated that myc-tagged TM9SF1 localized to the cell surface of transfected COS-7L cells.33 However, the function of TM9SF1 remained unknown until now. Here, we found that TM9SF1 may play an important role in autophagosome induction. We further found that TM9SF1-GFP localized to lysosomes, but not to other membrane compartments in transfected HeLa cells: TM9SF1-GFP colocalized extensively with LTR (lysosomal marker) and with DsRed-LC3 (autophagic vacuole marker). Furthermore, knockdown of TM9SF1 by RNA interference could attenuate autophagosome formation. Collectively, we hypothesized that TM9SF1 might play a modulating role in the process of autophagy, and then accelerate functional autophagy. But the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In summary, we have established an effective and convenient cell-based screening platform, which can be applied for high-throughput genomic screening candidate autophagyrelated genes using human cDNA and/or siRNA libraries. Three genes (TMEM74, TMEM166 and TM9SF1) were identified as positive genes which overexpression can induce autophagosome formation. TM9SF1 was further investigated as a novel autophagy-related gene. Further studies will be required to elucidate the specific role of TM9SF1 in autophagy.

HeLa cells transfected with TM9SF1 or TM9SF1-GFP were grown on coverslips, and stained with 200 nM LTR for 15 min, 100 nM MTR for 15 min, or 0.05 mM Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) for 1 h at 37°C; cells were washed three times with PBS and observed using a Leica TCS SP2 Confocal System (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with the appropriate filters. HeLa cells cotransfected with TM9SF1-GFP and DsRed-LC3 were observed directly using the same confocal system. For myc-tagged TM9SF1, indirect immunofluorescence assay was used. Electron microscopy analysis. HeLa cells cultured on coverslips were prefixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4°C, treated with 1% OsO4 for 2 h at 4°C, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and flat embedded in epon. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan). The number of autophagosomes per cell profile was determined by an observer blinded to experimental conditions for a minimum of 50 cells for each specimen. Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously.12 Total cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells, and immunoblotting was performed using different antibodies. Enzymatic assay. Lysosomal acid phosphatase activity was assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP) substrates as described.13,14 HeLa cells were lysed with enzyme lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton-X100, 300 mM NaCl) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The supernatants were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with 1 mM 4-MUP substrate in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.15 M glycine buffer (pH 10.3), and the fluorescence was measured at Excitation 355 nm/Emission 460 nm by using a GENios Pro reader (Tecan, Switzerland). TM9SF1 siRNAs synthesis and electroporation transfection. Specific siRNA against TM9SF1 with targeting sequence 5'-GAA TGG CTG AGT CTT TGT A-3' (si-TM9SF1) was synthesized by RiboBio Corporation (Guangzhou, China). Nonsilencing siRNA
