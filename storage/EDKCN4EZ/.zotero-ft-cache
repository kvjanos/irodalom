Macroautophagy is a vital process in the cardiac myocyte: it plays a protective role in the response to ischemic injury, and chronic perturbation is causative in heart disease. Recent ﬁndings evidence a link between the apoptotic and autophagic pathways through the interaction of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL with Beclin 1. However, the nature of the interaction, either in promoting or blocking autophagy, remains unclear. Here, using a highly sensitive, macroautophagy-speciﬁc ﬂux assay allowing for the distinction between enhanced autophagosome production and suppressed autophagosome degradation, we investigated the control of Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 on nutrient deprivation-activated macroautophagy. We found that in HL-1 cardiac myocytes the relationship between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 is subtle: Beclin 1 mutant lacking the Bcl-2-binding domain signiﬁcantly reduced autophagic activity, indicating that Beclin 1-mediated autophagy required an interaction with Bcl-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 had no effect on the autophagic response to nutrient deprivation; however, targeting Bcl-2 to the sarco ⁄ endoplasmic reticulum (S ⁄ ER) signiﬁcantly suppressed autophagy. The suppressive effect of S ⁄ ER-targeted Bcl-2 was in part due to the depletion of S ⁄ ER calcium stores. Intracellular scavenging of calcium by BAPTA-AM signiﬁcantly blocked autophagy, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarco ⁄ endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, reduced autophagic activity by  50%. In cells expressing Bcl-2–ER, thapsigargin maximally reduced autophagic ﬂux. Thus, our results demonstrate that Bcl-2 negatively regulated the autophagic response at the level of S ⁄ ER calcium content rather than via direct interaction with Beclin 1. Moreover, we identify calcium homeostasis as an essential component of the autophagic response to nutrient deprivation.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a highly regulated process by which the cell degrades portions of its cytoplasm and is distinct from chaperone-mediated autophagy and microautophagy [1]. The autophagic process consists of three

phases: formation and engulfment, in which portions of the cytoplasm, such as mitochondria and protein aggregates, are surrounded by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes; delivery of autophagosomes and their contents to lysosomes; and

degradation of the autophagosomes and cargo by lysosomal proteases [2,3]. The autophagic pathway is crucial for maintaining cell homeostasis and disruption to the pathway can be a contributing factor to many diseases. Decreased autophagy may promote the development of cancer [4] and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s [5] and Parkinson’s diseases [6]. In the heart, autophagy may protect against apoptosis activated by ischemic injury [7], and its chronic perturbation is causative in a genetic form of heart disease [8]. Conversely, autophagy can also act as a form of programmed cell death linked to, but distinct from, apoptosis [9,10]. Beclin 1, a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseinteracting protein [11], plays a role in promoting autophagy [12]. Beclin 1 contains a Bcl-2-binding domain which may serve as a point of cross-talk between the autophagic and apoptotic pathways. Recently, a BH3 domain in the Bcl-2-binding domain of Beclin 1 was shown to bind to Bcl-XL [13]. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have been shown to activate the autophagic response during programmed cell death in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts [10]. Conversely, Bcl-2 has been shown to suppress starvation-induced autophagy in MCF7 cancer cells [14]. Autophagy begins with formation of the autophagosome. The machinery controlling formation of the autophagosome involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. The ﬁrst is the conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5 [15]. The other is the processing of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Upon activation of autophagy, cytosolic LC3-I undergoes covalent conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine [16] to form LC-II, which is then recruited into the autophagosome-forming membrane, with Atg12 conjugation to Atg5 as a necessary prerequisite [17]. The recent characterization of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)–LC3 is a driving force in the autophagy ﬁeld as it functions as a unique and speciﬁc indicator for autophagosomes in live cells [18]. Currently, demonstration of GFP–LC3 punctae visualized by ﬂuorescence imaging, or LC3-I processing detected by western blotting [18] are widely used methods for detecting changes in autophagic activity and autophagosome formation. However, it is important to note that lysosomal degradation of LC3-II varies according to cell type [19,20]. Moreover, increased numbers of autophagosomes can reﬂect impaired fusion with lysosomes rather than an upregulation of autophagic activity [21]. Lysosomal degradation of LC3-II is regarded as a more accurate reﬂection of autophagic activity, and therefore the accumulation of LC3-II in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors is a more accurate

indicator of autophagy [20]. For these reasons, studies which rely on steady-state LC3-II concentrations or the steady-state abundance of autophagosomes may reach incorrect conclusions, as increased numbers of autophagosomes do not always correlate with increased autophagic activity. The goal of this study was to determine the roles of Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 in controlling autophagy. We employed a highly sensitive systematic approach for evaluating autophagy under high-nutrient conditions and in response to nutrient deprivation in the HL-1 cardiac cell line. Active autophagic ﬂux in a cell was determined based upon the increase in GFP–LC3-II accumulation in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors. We found that Bcl-2 has both an activating and suppressive effect on autophagy. Although the Bcl-2binding domain of Beclin 1 is required for autophagy, Bcl-2 destabilization of sarco ⁄ endoplasmic reticulum (S ⁄ ER) calcium stores can override Beclin 1 induction of autophagy. These ﬁndings reveal additional levels of complexity in the control of autophagy. Physiologic and pathophysiologic implications of this relationship to cardiomyocyte function are discussed.

Results
Inhibiting lysosomal activity to quantify autophagic ﬂux During the initiation of autophagy, cytosolic LC3 (LC3-I) is cleaved and lipidated to form LC3-II [16,20]. LC3-II is then recruited to the autophagosomal membrane [17]. Transient transfection of the fusion protein, GFP–LC3, allows detection of autophagosomes which appear as punctae by ﬂuorescence microscopy of live or ﬁxed cells. In this study, we utilized the extent of GFP–LC3labeled autophagosome formation during a set amount of time as a speciﬁc index of macroautophagic activity. To determine the autophagic ﬂux, a lysosomal inhibitor cocktail consisting of the cell-permeable pepstatin A methyl ester (PepA; 5 lgÆlL)1, inhibitor of cathepsin D), (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E64d; 5 lgÆlL)1, inhibitor of cathepsin B) and baﬁlomycin A1 (Baf; 50 lm; inhibitor of the vacuolar proton ATPase) was used to block lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes [20]. Inhibition of cathepsin activity was veriﬁed utilizing the ﬂuorescent MagicRed cathepsin B substrate [22]. Under normal conditions processing of the MagicRed substrate to its ﬂuorescent form by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B allows detection of individual organelles representing the lysosomes. In cells treated with

the inhibitor cocktail, ﬂuorescence intensity was lower due to decreased MagicRed processing by cathepsin B (Fig. 1A). Similarly, LysoTracker Red, which accumulates in acidic organelles, serves to reveal lysosomal acidiﬁcation, which is required for protease activity [23] and autophagosome–lysosome fusion [24]. Baf effectively blocked lysosomal acidiﬁcation (Fig. 1B). Quantifying autophagy and autophagic ﬂux in HL-1 cardiac myocytes We ﬁrst characterized the basal level of autophagy in fully supplemented medium [25]. GFP–LC3-expressing HL-1 cells were incubated without or with lysosomal inhibitor cocktail for 3.5 h. Autophagosomes were visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy, revealing two distinct populations: cells containing few or no GFP– LC3 punctae (‘low’), and a small population of cells exhibiting numerous GFP–LC3 punctae (‘high’). To evaluate the effect of rapamycin (Rm), which is known to stimulate autophagy even under high nutrient conditions [26–28], GFP–LC3-expressing HL-1 cells were treated with or without 1 lm Rm in the presence or absence of the lysosomal inhibitors. After 30 min incubation with Rm, cells showed a robust increase in the numbers of GFP–LC3 dots per cell (Fig. 2A, right).

Next, we quantiﬁed the percentage of cells showing numerous GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell by ﬂuorescence microscopy. The results, shown in the bar graph (Fig. 2B), indicate the percentage of cells showing numerous GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell at steady-state. Similar scoring in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitors, allows determination of cumulative autophagosome formation over a deﬁned time interval. The difference in the number of cells with high autophagosome content in the presence or absence of inhibitors (numbers inserted in graphs) represents the percentage of cells with high autophagic ﬂux. Under full medium (FM) conditions, in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, only a small, statistically insigniﬁcant increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting high autophagosome content was observed, indicating low autophagic ﬂux under high nutrient conditions. In contrast, Rm stimulated a signiﬁcant increase in autophagic ﬂux. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that Rm-stimulated autophagy in FM exceeds the capacity for autophagosome degradation, as steady-state levels of autophagy increased even though ﬂux was greatly enhanced. In order to further characterize autophagic ﬂux in cell populations, GFP–LC3-expressing cells in FM were treated with or without Rm in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors, and the number of GFP–LC3

punctae in individual cells was quantiﬁed. As shown in Fig. 2C, histogram analysis revealed a bimodal distribution between ‘low’ and ‘high’ numbers of GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell. In the absence of lysosomal inhibitors, the majority of cells had < 20 GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell and none had > 30 GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell. In contrast, the majority of cells treated with Rm exhibited > 60 GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell. Cells with intermediate numbers of autophagosomes were very infrequent. Thus, this distinctive bimodal distribution allows straightforward evaluation of autophagy in a population of cells. Autophagic response to nutrient deprivation Autophagy is strongly upregulated in response to nutrient deprivation [19,29]. To examine the autophagic response to starvation in HL-1 cells, GFP–LC3expressing cells were subjected to nutrient deprivation by incubation in modiﬁed Krebs-Henseleit buffer (MKH), which lacks amino acids and serum. Interestingly, after incubation in MKH in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors, most cells exhibited few auto-

phagosomes (Fig. 3), resembling cells incubated in FM (Fig. 2B). This observation in HL-1 cells differs from results in other cell lines [14,20]. However, the addition of lysosomal inhibitors for 3.5 h revealed robust autophagic activity, with  90% of cells displaying high numbers of GFP–LC3 dots ⁄ cell (Fig. 3). The remaining  10% of cells showed low numbers of GFP–LC3 punctae, possibly because they were in a phase of the cell cycle in which autophagy is suppressed [30,31]. These results demonstrate that autophagic ﬂux was substantially upregulated in HL-1 cells in response to nutrient deprivation, consistent with previous reports [32,33]. Beclin 1 control of the autophagic response to nutrient deprivation requires a functional Bcl-2 ⁄ -XL-binding domain We next investigated the control of Beclin 1 and its binding partner, Bcl-2, on autophagic activity. Beclin 1 was the ﬁrst mammalian protein described to mediate autophagy [12]. Beclin 1 interaction with the class III

In contrast, Beclin 1DBcl2BD expression signiﬁcantly reduced autophagic ﬂux in both high- and low-nutrient conditions (Fig. 4), indicating that Beclin 1-mediated autophagy required the Bcl-2binding domain for maximal autophagic response.

phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVps34 is required for activation of the autophagic pathway [34]. Beclin 1 contains a Bcl-2-binding domain which has been shown to interact with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but not proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members [35]. However, the nature of the relationship between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that Bcl-2 plays a role in the suppression of starvation-induced autophagy [14,36]; others have shown that Bcl-2 positively regulates autophagic cell death activated by etoposide [10]. Here we sought to determine the effect of Beclin 1 and its mutant lacking the Bcl-2-binding domain (Beclin 1DBcl2BD) [14] on autophagic activity under high- and low-nutrient conditions. Both Flag–Beclin 1 and its mutant constructs express at comparable levels in HL-1 cells [32]. Under high-nutrient conditions, steady-state and cumulative autophagy were similar between control and Beclin 1-transfected cells (Fig. 4). In MKH buffer, both control and Beclin 1-overexpressing cell populations responded to nutrient

Our ability to quantify autophagic ﬂux (versus the commonly reported autophagosome content) revealed the surprising ﬁnding that Beclin 1DBcl2BD suppressed autophagy. This was in contrast to the studies of Pattingre et al. [14], who showed that in cancer cells, Beclin 1DBcl2BD, as well as other Beclin 1 mutants lacking the ability to interact with Bcl-2, increased the percentage of cells containing numerous autophagosomes; these mutants have been shown to activate cell death during nutrient deprivation, attributed to excessive autophagy. In addition, they showed that Bcl-2 decreased steady-state autophagy through its interaction with the Beclin 1 Bcl-2-binding domain. To explore potential reasons for this discrepancy, we quantiﬁed autophagic ﬂux in order to evaluate the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on the response to nutrient deprivation. HL-1 cells were cotransfected with mCherry–LC3 and GFP–Bcl-2-wt (wild-type) or GFP–Bcl-2-ER (S ⁄ ER-targeted) (Fig. 5A). Although we found that Beclin 1DBcl2BD expression greatly reduced autophagic ﬂux, expression of wild-type Bcl-2 did not alter ﬂux (Fig. 5B). Endogenous Bcl-2 is found in the cytosol, at the mitochondria, and at the S ⁄ ER [37]. Forced localization of Bcl-2 to the S ⁄ ER has previously been reported to suppress autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation, as indicated by the decrease in the percentage of cells displaying numerous autophagosomes [14]. Our measurement of autophagic activity in the presence and absence of lysosomal inhibitors revealed that Bcl-2-ER, unlike Bcl-2-wt, potently suppressed autophagic ﬂux in response to nutrient deprivation (Fig. 5B). Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits autophagy due to depletion of sequestered S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores The strong suppressive effect on autophagy exerted by Beclin 1DBcl2BD, the profound suppressive effect of Bcl-2-ER, and the minimal suppressive effect of Bcl-2wt were inconsistent with the notion that Bcl-2 functions as a direct suppressor of Beclin 1 activity. These results suggested the existence of another mechanism

controlling autophagic activity. Bcl-2 increases the permeability of the S ⁄ ER to Ca2+ [38] through its interaction with sarco ⁄ endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), which is responsible for pumping Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the S ⁄ ER [39]. Intriguingly, S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores are required for the activation of autophagy [40] as well as downstream lysosomal function [41]. We hypothesized that Bcl-2 targeted to the S ⁄ ER inhibits autophagy in part due to modulation of the S ⁄ ER Ca2+ content. We ﬁrst sought to determine whether overexpression of Bcl-2 signiﬁcantly reduced Ca2+ content in HL-1 cardiac cells. S ⁄ ER Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained by the opposing processes of release by the ryanodine receptor and re-uptake by SERCA. Thapsigargin (TG), a selective SERCA inhibitor, can be used to deplete S ⁄ ER calcium stores by blocking reuptake [42]. Experiments were performed in the presence of norepinephrine (0.1 mm) to stimulate S ⁄ ER Ca2+ release, and S ⁄ ER Ca2+ content was inferred by measuring the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ 1 min after TG treatment, using the ﬂuorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 (2 lm). TG-mediated depletion of S ⁄ ER Ca2+ was similar in control and

Bcl-2-wt transfected cells, but was signiﬁcantly reduced in cells transfected with Bcl-2-ER (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that the capacity for S ⁄ ER Ca2+ release, an index of S ⁄ ER Ca2+ content, is reduced by Bcl-2-ER in the HL-1 cardiac myocyte, in agreement with studies performed in other cell lines [39,43]. Positive regulation of autophagy by S ⁄ ER Ca2+ We then sought to determine whether low levels of cytosolic Ca2+ might inﬂuence the activation of autophagy by nutrient deprivation. BAPTA-AM (25 lm), a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator [44,45], was added to HL-1 cells, and autophagic ﬂux was quantiﬁed. BAPTA-AM treatment resulted in nearly complete inhibition of autophagic activity (Fig. 7A). Moreover, BAPTA-AM decreased autophagy even in the presence of Rm (1 lm; results not shown). To determine whether S ⁄ ER Ca2+ content affected autophagic activity, we depleted S ⁄ ER Ca2+ with TG. In control, Bcl-2-wt, and Bcl-2-ER-transfected cells, TG (1 lm) signiﬁcantly suppressed nutrient deprivation-induced autophagic activity (Fig. 7B).

(A) Western blots of cell lysates from transfected cells shows the expression of GFP–Bcl-2 constructs and endogenous Bcl-2 (endo). The whole population of cells from each condition was collected for western blot and therefore includes untransfected cells. Transfection efﬁciency was noticeably higher with GFP–Bcl-2-ER, accounting for the difference seen on western blot. However, the apparent intensity of ﬂuorescence in cells expressing GFP–Bcl-2-ER was similar to that of GFP–Bcl-2-wt (results not shown), thus allowing us to conclude that differential effects of Bcl-2-ER were due to its localization rather than a difference in expression levels.

steady-state autophagosome accumulation and autophagic ﬂux, we revealed a complex role for Bcl-2 in the regulation of autophagy: under normal conditions Bcl-2 positively regulates autophagy via its interaction with Beclin 1, yet under conditions in which Bcl-2 is concentrated at the S ⁄ ER, the consequent depletion of S ⁄ ER lumenal Ca2+ results in an overriding inhibition of autophagy.

somes [47], it is not known whether GFP–LC3 overexpression truly upregulates autophagy. Importantly, however, transgenic mice expressing GFP–LC3 can develop normally without detectable abnormalities [19]. The application of maximal projections of Z-stacks provides a more complete assessment to detect the number of GFP–LC3-positive dots than that obtained by 2D imaging or electron microscopy, which is limited to the plane of focus or selected intracellular regions. Moreover, unlike commonly used assays measuring degradation of long-lived proteins, the technique we employed is speciﬁc to quantify macroautophagy. Such a distinction is relevant, as chaperonemediated autophagy, which targets cytosolic proteins, is strongly stimulated by ketone bodies, which build up during starvation [48], and by oxidative stress [49].

In fact, recent ﬁndings indicate that chaperone-mediated autophagy and macroautophagy may have compensatory functions [50]. In agreement with previous reports [20,51], our results further dispute the widely held assumption that cellular autophagosome numbers correlate with autophagic activity: we show that in response to nutrient deprivation low autophagosome numbers can reﬂect either high lysosomal turnover of autophagosomes or low autophagic ﬂux. Notably, HL-1 cells in FM (low autophagic activity) or undergoing nutrient deprivation (high autophagic activity) exhibit low steady-state levels of GFP–LC3-positive punctae. This result was surprising, as the upregulation of autophagy by starvation has been reported in vivo [19], in isolated primary cells [33], and in other cell lines [52] [14,20]. This discrepancy may be a characteristic of HL-1 cells. The turnover rate of lysosomal degradation may be faster than in other cell types. In addition, the presence of glucose in MKH buffer might have permitted efﬁcient clearance of autophagosomes, in contrast to studies in which glucose, as well as serum and amino acids, was eliminated. We suggest that the best indicator of autophagic activity is ﬂux, which we deﬁne as the percentage of cells with numerous autophagosomes after lysosomal inhibition (cumulative), minus the percentage of cells with numerous autophagosomes in the absence of lysosomal inhibitors (steady-state). An increase in steady-state autophagy without a corresponding increase in cumulative autophagy would indicate a defect in autophagosome clearance (a failure to route autophagosome to lysosomes or to degrade them once fused with lysosomes). Conversely, decreased steady-state autophagy in conjunction with decreased cumulative autophagy would indicate impaired formation of autophagosomes. This approach therefore provides additional information about the process of autophagy, revealing points of impairment, and reduces the potential for misinterpretation of results obtained by monitoring LC3–GFP punctae. Endogenous Bcl-2 enables maximum Beclin 1-mediated autophagic activity during nutrient deprivation The effect of the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl2 ⁄ -XL on autophagic activity is unclear. Control cells exhibited robust autophagic activity in response to nutrient deprivation and Rm, indicating that endogenous levels of Beclin 1 were sufﬁcient to drive maximal autophagic activity. In contrast, the Beclin 1 mutant (Beclin 1DBcl2BD) suppressed autophagy, indicating that Beclin 1DBcl2BD functioned as a dominant-negative protein during nutrient deprivation. By contrast,

Bcl-2 and calcium control of autophagy

N. R. Brady et al.

Beclin 1DBcl2BD functioned similar to wild-type Beclin 1 to promote clearance of toxic huntingtin aggregates in neurons [53]. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts overexpressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL exhibited increased levels of Atg5–Atg12 conjugates and more GFP–LC3 punctae in response to etoposide [10], and Beclin 1 lacking or mutated in the Bcl-2-binding domain caused a massive accumulation of autophagosomes and induced cell death in both FM and under starvation conditions [14]. In light of our ﬁndings that autophagic ﬂux is impaired in cells overexpressing Beclin 1DBcl2BD, it is possible to reinterpret the observation of increased numbers of autophagosomes as an indication of impaired autophagolysosomal clearance rather than increased autophagy. Although it is possible that deletion of the Bcl-2-binding domain has a nonspeciﬁc effect on Beclin 1 function, we think that our results indicate a requirement for Bcl-2 interaction to promote autophagy. One possible interpretation is that a trimolecular complex, comprising Beclin 1, Bcl-XL (or Bcl-2), and the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34, is required for autophagosome formation. In the case of Beclin 1DBcl2BD, a nonproductive bimolecular complex (lacking Bcl-2) would form. Beclin 1DBcl2BD would compete with Beclin 1 for interaction with Vps34, and in the case of overexpression, would act as a competitive inhibitor. Pattingre et al. [14] showed that autophagosome content was negatively correlated with the amount of Bcl-2 that interacted with Beclin 1, and that Bcl-2 binding of Beclin 1 interfered with the Beclin 1–Vps34 interaction, which signals autophagy. In support of this model, the authors showed that high levels of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 coimmunoprecipitated under high-nutrient conditions, and conversely, Bcl-2 did not coimmunoprecipitate with Beclin 1 under low-nutrient conditions. However, Zeng et al. [54] showed that endogenous Bcl-2 did not interact with Beclin 1 in U-251 cells under FM conditions; only through overexpression of Bcl-2 was such an interaction detected. Moreover, Kihara et al. [34] found that under FM conditions all Beclin 1 in HeLa cells is bound to Vps34. These diverging reports raise the possibility that rheostatic control of autophagy by Beclin 1–Bcl)2 interaction is not a universal mechanism. Further experiments are needed to clarify the nature of Bcl-2 control of autophagy at the level of S ⁄ ER calcium and Beclin 1 binding. S ⁄ ER-localized Bcl-2 depletes S ⁄ ER Ca2+-content, thereby inhibiting autophagy High S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores are required for autophagy [40]. We found that Bcl-2-ER suppressed autophagic activity, similar to the previous report [14] and reduced S ⁄ ER Ca2+ content, as previously shown [39,43].
3192

Moreover, we directly demonstrated the Ca2+ requirement for autophagic activity: intracellular chelation of Ca2+ by BAPTA, and depletion of S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores by the SERCA inhibitor TG, both profoundly suppressed autophagy. The recent report by Criollo et al. [36] found that TG increased the percentage of cells with numerous autophagosomes, which they interpreted as increased autophagic activity. Our studies are consistent with their steady-state observations, but our ﬂux measurements allow us to conclude that TG impairs autophagic ﬂux, and reveal that this effect is in fact related to S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores. Although overexpression of Bcl-2-wt did not suppress autophagy, this may reﬂect the amount of Bcl-2 localized to the S ⁄ ER, which was considerably less than when expressing ER-targeted Bcl-2. We speculate that the specialized S ⁄ ER of the HL-1 cardiac myocyte, which contains high SERCA levels, is able to overcome some degree of Bcl-2 leak and maintain S ⁄ ER Ca2+content in response to low levels of Bcl-2 [43], yet would be impaired by supra-physiological levels of Bcl-2 at the S ⁄ ER [39]. It is interesting to note that the physiological implications of S ⁄ ER-targeted Bcl-2 in the cardiac myocyte are unclear. Conditions that trigger preferential recruitment of Bcl-2 to the S ⁄ ER have not been shown and it is not known if this might occur under physiologic or pathologic conditions. Although enforced Ca2+ release from S ⁄ ER stores, by either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, minimizes the Ca2+signaling component of apoptosis [55], it is not known if S ⁄ ER targeted-Bcl-2 affects the ability of the cardiac myocyte to contract. While the decrease of S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores might be predicted to be harmful to the heart by reducing its capacity to do work, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in the heart do not exhibit overt cardiac dysfunction [56,57]. The requirement for S ⁄ ER Ca2+ stores to support autophagy is clear, yet the regulating mechanism remains unknown. Suppression of autophagy by BAPTA buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ or by TG-mediated reduction in ER luminal Ca2+ suggests that transient S ⁄ ER Ca2+ release may be a necessary cofactor for activation of autophagy. In this scenario, depending on the nature of amplitude and duration of Ca2+ release by TG, its administration could conceivably result in a transient increase in autophagosome formation, followed by a sustained inhibition of autophagic ﬂux. As Vps34 contains a C2 domain, we speculate that transient Ca2+ elevations would trigger recruitment of the autophagic machinery to the membrane, in a manner analogous to the recruitment of cytosolic phospholipase A2 [58]. In addition, it was recently reported that calpain is required for autophagy [59,60],

Bcl-2 and calcium control of autophagy

indirectly implicating calcium necessary to activate calpain. However, this may be a two-edged sword, as it was reported that calpain converts Atg5 to a BH3-only protein capable of triggering apoptosis [61]. Signiﬁcance in the heart This study was carried out in the HL-1 cardiac myocyte cell line, which represents a useful model that may extend our understanding of the autophagic processes in the heart. The cardiac myocyte requires an efﬁcient supply and delivery of ATP from the mitochondria to perform work and maintain ion homeostasis. Ca2+ couples mitochondrial ATP production to demand: Ca2+ release during the action potential stimulates both acto-myosin ATPase activity (contraction) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [62] through activation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle [63]. Our results reveal that, in addition, Ca2+ homeostasis is required for maximal macroautophagic activity in the cardiac myocytes. It is well known that altered Ca2+ homeostasis plays a causative role in many forms of cardiovascular disease [64,65]. Our results also suggest that under certain conditions Bcl-2 is required for autophagic activity, supporting previous ﬁndings that increased Bcl-2 and autophagic activity correlated with protection in an in vivo model of ischemic injury [7,57]. In conclusion, autophagy is emerging as an important process involved in programmed cell death as well as cytoprotection. We suggest that the inability to mount an autophagic response due to depleted S ⁄ ER Ca2+ is relevant for paradigms of both cellular protection and cell death. The additional insights gained from measurement of autophagic ﬂux may necessarily lead to re-evaluation and reinterpretation of published results. The ﬁndings of Levine’s [14] and Kroemer’s [36] groups in relation to this study clearly illustrate the need to revisit studies in which the steady-state abundance of autophagosomes was used to infer the extent of autophagic activity.

Cells were transfected with the indicated vectors using the transfection reagent Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, achieving at least 40% transfection efﬁciency. For experiments aimed at determining autophagic ﬂux, HL-1 cells were transfected with GFP–LC3 and the indicated vector at a ratio of 1 : 3 lg DNA. For calcium imaging experiments, HL-1 cells were transfected with mito-ECFP [66] and the indicated vector at a ratio of 1 : 3 lg DNA.

High- and low-nutrient conditions
Cells were plated in 14-mm-diameter glass bottom microwell 4 dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). For high-nutrient conditions, experiments were performed in fully supplemented Claycomb medium. For low-nutrient conditions, experiments were performed in modiﬁed MKH (in mm: 110 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.25 MgSO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, 20 Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubation at 95% room air)5% CO2.

Wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy
Cells were observed through a Nikon TE300 ﬂuorescence 5 microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with a ·10 lens (0.3 NA, Nikon), a ·40 Plan Fluor and a ·60 Plan Apo objective (1.4 NA and 1.3 NA oil immersion lenses; Nikon), 6 a Z-motor (ProScanII, Prior Scientiﬁc, Rockland, MA), a cooled CCD camera (Orca-ER, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, 7 NJ) and automated excitation and emission ﬁlter wheels controlled by a LAMBDA 10–2 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, 8 CA) operated by MetaMorph 6.2r4 (Molecular Devices Co., 9 Downington, PA). Fluorescence was excited through an excitation ﬁlter for ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (HQ480 ⁄ ·40), and Texas Red (D560 ⁄ ·40). Fluorescent light was collected via a polychroic beamsplitter (61002 bs) and an emission ﬁlter for ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (HQ535 ⁄ 50 m), and Texas Red (D630 ⁄ 60 m). All ﬁlters were from Chroma. Acquired wideﬁeld Z-stacks were routinely deconvolved using 10 iterations of a 3D blind deconvolution algorithm (AutoQuant) to maximize spatial resolution. Unless stated otherwise, representative images shown are maximum projections of Z-stacks taken with 0.3 lm increments capturing total cellular volume.

Baf (50 nm, vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor) to inhibit autophagosome–lysosome fusion [24], and E64d (5 lgÆmL)1, inhibitor of cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B), and PepA (5 lgÆmL)1, cathepsin D inhibitor) to inhibit lysosomal protease activity, for an interval of 3.5 h. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde in NaCl ⁄ Pi (pH 7.4) for 15 min. To quantify the number of GFP–LC3 punctae in a single cell, Z-stack images of single GFP–LC3-expressing cells were captured using ·60 oil objective and then background ﬂuorescence was removed by applying a mean ﬁlter (4-pixel) to each stack image. Maximal projection images were produced, and the number of GFP–LC3 punctae per cell was determined using imagej software (NIH, Bethesda, 10 MD). For population analysis, cells were inspected at 60· magniﬁcation and classiﬁed as: (a) cells with predominantly diffuse GFP–LC3 ﬂuorescence; or as (b) cells with numerous GFP–LC3 punctae (> 30 dots ⁄ cell), representing autophagosomes. At least 200 cells were scored for each condition in three or more independent experiments.

Western blotting
Whole-cell lysates were subjected to 10–20% trisglycine SDS ⁄ PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with anti-Bcl-2 serum (C-2, 1 : 200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or antiBeclin 1 serum (1 : 200).

Statistics
The probability of statistically signiﬁcant differences between two experimental groups was determined by Student’s t-test. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments unless stated otherwise.

Determining the activity of the lysosomal compartment
LysoTracker Red is a cell-permeable acidotropic probe that selectively labels vacuoles with low internal pH and thus can be used to label functional lysosomes. Following sI ⁄ R and control experiments, cells were loaded with 50 nm LysoTracker Red for 5 min in MKH; the medium was then exchanged with dye-free MKH, and cells were imaged at ·40 magniﬁcation by ﬂuorescence microscopy. Activity and intracellular distribution of cathepsin B, a predominant lysosomal protease, was assessed using (z-RR)2-MagicRedCathepsin B substrate (B-Bridge International, Inc., Moun11 tain View, CA). MagicRed-Cathepsin B substrate was added to the cells during the last 30 min of an experiment according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Calcium imaging
For dye loading, Fluo-4 was dissolved in in 20% (w ⁄ v) Pluronic F-127 in dimethylsulfoxide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; #P-300MP) to a 2 mm stock Fluo-4 ⁄ AM solution. Cells were incubated for 20 min in 2 lm Fluo-2 ⁄ AM at 37 °C in MKH buffer. Then the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free MKH buffer containing 0.1 mm norepinephrine and cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C prior to imaging. Mito-CFP-transfected cells were selected and 10 consecutive images (1Æs)1) of Fluo-4 were acquired. TG (1 lm) was then added, allowed to incubate for 1 min, and subsequently 10 consecutive images (1Æs)1) of Fluo-4 ﬂuorescence were acquired. The average change in Fluo-4 ﬂuorescence (F) intensity (Finitial ⁄ (Fﬁnal ) Finitial)) was determined from cellular image intensities using the imagej multi-ROI function (rsb.info. nih.gov ⁄ ij).
