ABSTRACT: White adipocytes have a unique structure in which nearly the entire cell volume is occupied by one large lipid droplet. However, the molecular and cellular processes involved in the cytoplasmic remodeling necessary to create this structure are poorly defined. Autophagy is a membrane trafficking process leading to lysosomal degradation. Here, we investigated the effect of the deletion of an essential autophagy gene, autophagy-related gene 7 (atg7), on adipogenesis. Amouse model with a targeted deletion of atg7 in adipose tissue was generated. The mutant mice were slim and contained only 20% of the mass of white adipose tissue (WAT) found in wild-type mice. Interestingly, ≈50% of the mutant white adipocytes were multilocular. The mutant white adipocytes were smaller with a larger volume of cytosol and contained more mitochondria. These cells exhibited altered fatty acid metabolism with increased rates of β-oxidation and reduced rates of hormone-induced lipolysis. Consistently, the mutant mice had lower fed plasma concentrations of fatty acids and the levels decreased at faster rates upon insulin stimuli. These mutant mice exhibited increased insulin sensitivity. The mutant mice also exhibited markedly decreased plasma concentrations of leptin but not adiponectin, lower plasma concentrations of triglyceride and cholesterol, and they had higher levels of basal physical activity. Strikingly, these mutant mice were resistant to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Taken together, our results indicate that atg7, and by inference autophagy, plays an important role in normal adipogenesis and that inhibition of autophagy by disrupting the atg7 gene has a unique anti-obesity and insulin sensitization effect.

ABSTRACT: Background: The era of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has led to the identification of many inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with unknown function. The next step would be to identify the functional consequences of these polymorphisms in order to target them efficiently for therapeutic purposes. One way to study this type of genetic variation is the use of cell line models. However, to characterize the functional effect of a SNP, it is important to know if the selected cell line model itself carries the studied genetic variation. Here, we genotyped 50 IBD markers across 32 susceptibility genes in 9 commonly used gastrointestinal cell lines. Methods: We used Sequenom, TaqMan, and DNA sequencing for the genotyping. To determine the expression profile of the selected genes, we conducted real-time RT-PCR. Results: We found variant SNPs in all analyzed cell lines. Almost every minor allele was carried by at least one of the tested cell lines. We analyzed the effect of 4 SNPs in more detail using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) comprising genes ATG16L1, CD14, MDR1, and OCTN2. According to our data, only 2 of the commonly studied SNPs in MDR1 and CD14 have an impact on gene expression. Conclusions: We have identified genotype variants in all analyzed cell lines. Some of them are functional and alter the response to drugs (MDR1) or affect bacterial recognition (TLR4, NOD2). Our results highlight that the genotype should not be neglected in experimental design when using model cell lines. Copyright © 2009 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway that, when genetically downregulated, increases life span in evolutionarily diverse organisms including mammals. The central component of this pathway, TOR kinase, is the target of the inhibitory drug rapamycin, a highly specific and well-described drug approved for human use. We show here that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen in some TOR mutants. Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway, through alterations to both autophagy and translation. Rapamycin could increase life span of weak insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway mutants and of flies with life span maximized by dietary restriction, indicating additional mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The primary intracellular protein degradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome pathways, have been emerging as central regulators of viral infectivity, inflammation, and viral pathogenicity. Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart. The disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages: acute viral infection, immune cell infiltration, and cardiac remodelling. Growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages. Cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication. In addition, these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection. Recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems, with an emphasis on coxsackievirus B3, one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis, and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.

ABSTRACT: The regulation of autophagy in metazoans is only partly understood, and there is a need to identify the proteins that control this process. The diabetes-and obesity-regulated gene (DOR), a recently reported nuclear cofactor of thyroid hormone receptors, is expressed abundantly in metabolically active tissues such as muscle. Here, we show that DOR shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, depending on cellular stress conditions, and re-localizes to autophagosomes on autophagy activation. We demonstrate that DOR interacts physically with autophagic proteins Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE16) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies indicate that DOR stimulates autophagosome formation and accelerates the degradation of stable proteins. CG11347, the DOR Drosophila homologue, has been predicted to interact with the Drosophila Atg8 homologues, which suggests functional conservation in autophagy. Flies lacking CG11347 show reduced autophagy in the fat body during pupal development. All together, our data indicate that DOR regulates autophagosome formation and protein degradation in mammalian and Drosophila cells. © 2010 European Molecular Biology Organization.

Transcription factor GATA4 inhibits doxorubicin-induced autophagy and cardiomyocyte death

ABSTRACT: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent anti-tumor drug known to cause heart failure. The transcription factor GATA4 antagonizes DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the protective mechanism remains obscure. Autophagy is the primary cellular pathway for lysosomal degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, and its activation could be either protective or detrimental depending on specific pathophysiological conditions. Here we investigated the ability of GATA4 to inhibit autophagy as a potential mechanism underlying its protection against DOX toxicity in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. DOX markedly increased autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes as indicated by the difference in protein levels of LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 form 2) or numbers of autophagic vacuoles in the absence and presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1. DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death determined by multiple assays was aggravated by a drug or genetic approach that activates autophagy, but it was attenuated by manipulations that inhibit autophagy, suggesting that autophagy contributes to DOX cardiotoxicity. DOX treatment depleted GATA4 protein levels, which predisposed cardiomyocytes to DOX toxicity. Indeed, GATA4 gene silencing triggered autophagy that rendered DOX more toxic, whereas GATA4 overexpression inhibited DOX-induced autophagy, reducing cardiomyocyte death. Mechanistically, GATA4 up-regulated gene expression of the survival factor Bcl2 and suppressed DOX-induced activation of autophagy-related genes, which may likely be responsible for the anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic effects of GATA4. Together, these findings suggest that activation of autophagy mediates DOX cardiotoxicity, and preservation of GATA4 attenuates DOX cardiotoxicity by inhibiting autophagy through modulation of the expression of Bcl2 and autophagy-related genes. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In Ngsk prion protein (PrP)-deficient mice (NP<sup>00</sup>), ectopic expression of PrP-like protein Doppel (Dpl) in central neurons induces significant Purkinje cell (PC) death resulting in late-onset ataxia. NP <sup>00</sup> PC death is partly prevented by either knocking-out the apoptotic factor BAX or overexpressing the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2 suggesting that apoptosis is involved in Dpl-induced death. In this study, Western blotting and immunohistofluorescence show that both before and during significant PC loss, the scrapie-responsive gene 1 (Scrg1) - potentially associated with autophagy - and the autophagic markers LC3B and p62 increased in the NP<sup>00</sup> PCs whereas RT-PCR shows stable mRNA expression, suggesting that the degradation of autophagic products is impaired in NP<sup>00</sup> PCs. At the ultrastructural level, autophagic-like profiles accumulated in somatodendritic and axonal compartments of NP<sup>00</sup>, but not wild-type PCs. The most robust autophagy was observed in NP<sup>00</sup> PC axon compartments in the deep cerebellar nuclei suggesting that it is initiated in these axons. Our previous and present data indicate that Dpl triggers autophagy and apoptosis in NP <sup>00</sup> PCs. As observed in amyloid neurodegenerative diseases, upregulation of autophagic markers as well as extensive accumulation of autophagosomes in NP<sup>00</sup> PCs are likely to reflect a progressive dysfunction of autophagy that could trigger apoptotic cascades. © 2008 International Society of Neuropathology.

ABSTRACT: Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a stress-regulated protein kinase that mediates a range of processes, including signal-induced cell death and autophagy. Although the kinase domain of DAPK has a range of substrates that mediate its signalling, the additional protein interaction domains of DAPK are relatively ill defined. This review will summarize our current knowledge of the DAPK interactome, the use of peptide aptamers to define novel protein-protein interaction motifs, and how these new protein-protein interactions give insight into DAPK functions in diverse cellular processes, including growth factor signalling, the regulation of autophagy, and its emerging role in the regulation of immune responses. © 2009 FEBS.

The autophagic responses of HeLa cells caused by four kinds of rare earth oxide nanoparticle (R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, R = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb) are studied. The results reveal that the autophagic response is dose dependent and time dependent and the autophagy-inducing activity is a general biological effect for the lanthanoid (see Figure).

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved intracellular process for vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic components. In higher plants, autophagy defects result in early senescence and excessive immunity-related programmed cell death (PCD) irrespective of nutrient conditions; however, the mechanisms by which cells die in the absence of autophagy have been unclear. Here, we demonstrate a conserved requirement for salicylic acid (SA) signaling for these phenomena in autophagydefective mutants (atg mutants). The atg mutant phenotypes of accelerated PCD in senescence and immunity are SA signaling dependent but do not require intact jasmonic acid or ethylene signaling pathways. Application of an SA agonist induces the senescence/cell death phenotype in SA-deficient atg mutants but not in atg nprt plants, suggesting that the cell death phenotypes in the atg mutants are dependent on the SA signal transducer NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1. We also show that autophagy is induced by the SA agonist. These findings imply that plant autophagy operates a novel negative feedback loop modulating SA signaling to negatively regulate senescence and immunity-related PCD. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an important component of host innate and adaptive immunity to viruses. It is critical for the degradation of intracellular pathogens and for promoting antigen presentation. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection induces an autophagy response, but this response is antagonized by the HSV-1 neurovirulence gene product, ICP34.5. This is due, in part, to its interaction with the essential autophagy protein Beclin 1 (Atg6) via the Beclin-binding domain (BBD) of ICP34.5. Using a recombinant virus lacking the BBD, we examined pathogenesis and immune responses using mouse models of infection. The BBD-deficient virus (Δ68H) replicated equivalently to its marker-rescued counterpart (Δ68HR) at early times but was cleared more rapidly than Δ68HR from all tissues at late times following corneal infection. In addition, the infection of the cornea with Δ68H induced less ocular disease than Δ68HR. These results suggested that Δ68H was attenuated due to its failure to control adaptive rather than innate immunity. In support of this idea, Δ68H stimulated a significantly stronger CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity response and resulted in significantly more production of gamma interferon and interleukin-2 from HSV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than Δ68HR. Taken together, these data suggest a role for the BBD of ICP34.5 in precluding autophagy-mediated class II antigen presentation, thereby enhancing the virulence and pathogenesis of HSV-1.

ABSTRACT: CCL2 is a cytokine prevalent in the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment. Recently, we reported that CCL2 induces the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to promote prostate cancer PC3 cell survival; however, themechanism used by CCL2 tomaintainmTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activation requires clarification. This study demonstrates that upon serum starvation, CCL2 functions as a negative regulator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by decreasing phosphorylation at its major regulatory site (Thr<sup>172</sup>) in PC3, DU145, and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. The CCL2-mediated AMPK regulation decreased raptor phosphorylation (Ser<sup>792</sup>) resulting in hyperactivation of mTORC1. D942, a pharmacological activator of AMPK, stunted CCL2-induced mTORC1 activity, survivin expression, and cell survival without significantly affecting Akt activity. CCL2, however, conferred some resistance to the lethal effect of D942 compared with untreated cells. By using Akt-specific inhibitor X, it was shown that Akt inactivation did not cause an increase in AMPK phosphorylation in CCL2-stimulated cells, suggesting that CCL2-mediated negative regulation of AMPK is independent of Akt. Furthermore, bisindolylmaleimide-V, a specific inhibitor of p70<sup>S6K</sup>, stunted survivin expression and induced cell death in CCL2-treated PC3. Altogether, these findings suggest that CCL2 hyperactivates mTORC1 through simultaneous regulation of both AMPK and Akt pathways and reveals a new network that promotes prostate cancer: CCL2-AMPK-mTORC1-survivin.

ABSTRACT: Mutations affecting the conversion of PI3P to the signaling lipid PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> result in spongiform degeneration of mouse brain and are associated with the human disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We now report accumulation of the proteins LC3-II, p62 and LAMP-2 in neurons and astrocytes of mice with mutations in two components of the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulatory complex, Fig4 and Vac14. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing p62 and ubiquinated proteins are present in regions of the mutant brain that undergo degeneration. Co-localization of p62 and LAMP-2 in affected cells indicates that formation or recycling of the autolysosome is impaired. These results establish a role for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in autophagy in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and demonstrate that mutations affecting PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> can contribute to inclusion body disease. © The Author 2009.

ABSTRACT: Mutations in genes involved in macroautophagy have been found to be associated with Morbus Crohn, also called Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease. Taking this disease as an example for pathogenesis due to altered macroautophagy, we discuss here how macroautophagy supports innate and adaptive immunity. This support ranges from maintenance of components of the immune system, antigen processing for presentation to the immune system, to education of the immune system in order to distinguish self from dangerous non-self. A better understanding of these mechanisms should allow us not only to develop therapeutical strategies for CD but also to utilize macroautophagy for enhanced immunity against pathogens and tumors.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy may represent a common cellular response to nanomaterials, and modulation of autophagy holds great promise for improving the efficacy of cancer therapy. Fullerene C60 possesses potent anti-cancer activities, but its considerable toxicity towards normal cells may hinder its practical applications. It has been reported that fullerene C60 induces certain hallmarks of autophagy in cancer cells. Here we show that the water-dispersed nanocrystal of underivatized fullerene C60 (Nano-C60) at noncytotoxic concentrations caused authentic autophagy and sensitized chemotherapeutic killing of both normal and drug-resistant cancer cells in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent and photo-enhanced fashion. We further demonstrated that the chemosensitization effect of Nano-C60 was autophagy-mediated and required a functional Atg5, a key gene in the autophagy signaling pathway. Our results revealed a novel biological function for Nano-C60 in enhancing the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents through autophagy modulation and may point to the potential application of Nano-C60 in adjunct chemotherapy. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a highly conserved housekeeping pathway that plays a critical role in the removal of aged or damaged intracellular organelles and their delivery to lysosomes for degradation. 1,2 Autophagy begins with the formation of membranes, arising in part from the endoplasmic reticulum, that elongate and fuse engulfing cytoplasmic constituents into a classic double-membrane bound nascent autophagosome. These early autophagosomes undergo a stepwise maturation process to form the late autophagosome or amphisome that ultimately fuses with a lysosome. Efficient autophagy is dependent on an equilibrium between the formation and elimination of autophagosomes; thus, a deficit in any part of this pathway will cause autophagic dysfunction. Autophagy plays a role in aging and agerelated diseases.1,2,7 However, few studies of autophagy in retinal disease have been reported. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Mammalian white adipocytes have a unique structure in which nearly the entire cell volume is occupied by a single large lipid droplet, while the surrounding cytoplasm occupies minimal space. The massive cytoplasmic remodeling processes involved in the formation of this unique cellular structure are poorly defined. Autophagy is a membrane trafficking process leading to lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components. Here, we investigated the functional role of atg5, a gene encoding an essential protein required for autophagy, in adipocyte differentiation in a cellular model and in mice. Massive autophagy was activated when wild-type primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were induced for adipocyte differentiation. Importantly, the autophagy deficient primary atg5<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs exhibited dramatically reduced efficiency in adipogenesis. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that atg5<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs initially appeared to differentiate normally; however, a majority of the differentiating atg5<sup>-/-</sup> cells ultimately failed to undergo further morphological transformation and eventually died, likely through apoptosis. Consistent with these in vitro results, histological analysis revealed that the atg5<sup>-/-</sup> latestage embryos and neonatal pups had much less subcutaneous perilipin A-positive adipocytes. Consistently, when treated with chloroquine, a functional inhibitor of autophagy, wild-type MEFs exhibited drastically reduced efficiency of adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Atg5 is involved in normal adipocyte differentiation, suggesting an important role of autophagy in adipogenesis. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Hypoxia commonly exists in solid tumors. Under such adverse conditions, adaptive responses including autophagy are usually provoked to promote cell survival. In our study, autophagy, a lysosomal-mediated degradation pathway, is demonstrated as a protective way to make hepatocellular carcinoma cells resistant to chemotherapy under hypoxia. Compared with normoxia, chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death under hypoxia was significantly decreased, as a result of the reduced apoptosis. However, when autophagy was inhibited by 3-MA or siRNA targeted Beclin 1, this reduction was reversed, i.e., chemoresistance was attenuated, which means autophagy mediates the chemoresistance under hypoxia. In conclusion, autophagy decreases hepatoma cells sensitization to chemotherapeutic agents by affecting their apoptotic potential. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy, a lysosomal process involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, is responsible for the turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles that are either damaged or functionally redundant. The process is tightly controlled by the insulin-amino acid-mammalian target of the rapamycin-dependent signal-transduction pathway. Research in the last decade has indicated not only that autophagy provides cells with oxidizable substrate when nutrients become scarce but also that it can provide protection against aging and a number of pathologies such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiac disease, diabetes, and infections. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in the valosin containing protein (VCP) gene. The disease is associated with progressive proximal muscle weakness, inclusions and vacuoles in muscle fibers, malfunction in the bone remodeling process resulting in Paget's disease, and premature frontotemporal dementia. VCP is involved in several cellular processes related to the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of proteins. To understand the pathological mechanisms underlying the myopathy in IBMPFD, we have studied the cellular consequences of VCP mutations in human primary myoblasts. Our results revealed that patients' myoblasts accumulate large vacuoles. Lysosomal membrane proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2 show increased molecular weights in patients' myoblasts due to differential N-glycosylation. Additionally, mutant myoblasts show increased autophagy when cultured in the absence of nutrients, as well as defective cell fusion and increased apoptosis. Our results elucidate that VCP mutations result in disturbances in several cellular processes, which will help us in the understanding of the pathological mechanisms resulting in muscle weakness and other features of VCP associated disease.

ABSTRACT: A progressive reduction in β-cell mass occurs in the evolution of diabetes. Thus understanding the mechanisms responsible for this reduction in β-cell mass is important for understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes and in developing novel approaches to prevention and treatment. Pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in pancreatic β-cell function and survival. Complete deficiency of Pdx1 is associated with pancreatic agenesis, and partial deficiency leads to severe β-cell dysfunction, and increases β-cell death and diabetes both in rodent and human. Chronic hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, which are major features of type 2 diabetes, cause β-cell dysfunction via reduced Pdx1 expression. Inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (Igf) signalling followed by reduced Pdx1 expression is a common pathway induced by the majority of the mechanisms in apoptotic β-cells. Although the report so far paid little attention to non-apoptotic β-cell death (autophagy and necrosis), we expect these are also involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. The potential role of Pdx1 in non-apoptotic β-cell death should also be considered in future studies in diabetes, and in attempts to develop novel agents that target this process for prevention and treatment of the disorder. © 2009 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that promotes its internalization within nonprofessional phagocytes by interacting with specific host cell receptors. L. monocytogenes resides transiently in a membrane-bound compartment before escaping into the host cell cytosol where bacterial proliferation takes place. Actin-based motility then promotes cell-to-cell pathogen spread. Extensive studies on cytoskeleton rearrangements, membrane trafficking, and other events have established this microorganism as an archetype of cellular function subversion for intracellular parasitism. Here we discuss the most significant membrane trafficking pathways hijacked by L. monocytogenes during the host cell infection process and compare them to those of other intracellular pathogens, in particular Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a fundamental biological process that endows eukaryotic cells with the ability to autodigest portions of their own cytoplasm. Autophagy plays roles in aging, development, neurodegeneration, cancer and immunity. The immunological role of autophagy was first recognized for the ability of autophagy to sanitize the cellular interior by killing intracellular microbes and, indirectly, by the adaptations that successful intracellular pathogens have evolved to protect themselves from autophagy. Since then, the repertoire of autophagy functions in immunity has been vastly expanded to include numerous intersections of regulatory and effector nature with innate and adaptive immunity. Autophagy acts both as an effector and a regulator of pattern recognition receptors, it supports MHC II presentation of cytosolic (self and microbial) antigens, it shapes central tolerance via thymic selection of the T cell repertoire, is an effector of Th1/Th2 polarization, affects homeostasis of T, B, and specialized immune cells such as Paneth cells, and - when defective - can be a contributing factor to chronic inflammatory conditions in human populations such as Crohn's disease.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy (or autophagy) is a conserved degradative pathway that has been implicated in a number of biological processes, including organismal aging, innate immunity, and the progression of human cancers. This pathway was initially identified as a cellular response to nutrient deprivation and is essential for cell survival during these periods of starvation. Autophagy is highly regulated and is under the control of a number of signaling pathways, including the Tor pathway, that coordinate cell growth with nutrient availability. These pathways appear to target a complex of proteins that contains the Atg1 protein kinase. The data here show that autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also controlled by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. Elevated levels of PKA activity inhibited autophagy and inactivation of the PKA pathway was sufficient to induce a robust autophagy response. We show that in addition to Atg1, PKA directly phosphorylates Atg13, a conserved regulator of Atg1 kinase activity. This phosphorylation regulates Atg13 localization to the preautophagosomal structure, the nucleation site from which autophagy pathway transport intermediates are formed. Atg13 is also phosphorylated in a Tor-dependent manner, but these modifications appear to occur at positions distinct from the PKA phosphorylation sites identified here. In all, our data indicate that the PKA and Tor pathways function independently to control autophagy in S. cerevisiae, and that the Atg1/Atg13 kinase complex is a key site of signal integration within this degradative pathway.

ABSTRACT: There are three types of cell death; apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. The possibility that activation of the macroautophagy (autophagy) pathwaymayincrease beta cell death is addressed in this study. Increased autophagy was present in pancreatic islets from Pdx1<sup>+/-</sup> mice with reduced insulin secretion and beta cell mass. Pdx1 expression was reduced in mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells by delivering small hairpinRNAsusing a lentiviral vector. The MIN6cells died after 7 days of Pdx1 deficiency, and autophagy was evident prior to the onset of cell death. Inhibition of autophagy prolonged cell survival and delayed cell death. Nutrient deprivation increased autophagy in MIN6 cells and mouse and human islets after starvation. Autophagy inhibition partly prevented amino acid starvation-inducedMIN6cell death. The in vivo effects of reduced autophagy were studied by crossing Pdx1<sup>+/-</sup> mice to Becn1<sup>+/</sup><sup>-</sup>mice. After1weekona high fat diet, 4-week-oldPdx1<sup>+/-</sup> Becn1<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed normal glucose tolerance, preserved beta cell function, and increased beta cell mass compared with Pdx1<sup>+/-</sup> mice. This protective effect of reduced autophagy had worn off after 7 weeks on a high fat diet. Increased autophagy contributes to pancreatic beta cell death in Pdx1 deficiency and following nutrient deprivation. The role of autophagy should be considered in studies of pancreatic beta cell death and diabetes and as a target for novel therapeutic intervention. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a highly conserved pathway for the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. Similar to apoptosis, autophagy is a critical regulatory mechanism for determining cellular fate and various pathophysiological conditions in metazoans. So far, the systematic analysis of the expression patterns and transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related (ATG) genes has remained incompletely defined. In this study, we used RT-PCR to analyze the expression patterns of 26 human ATG genes simultaneously using cDNA derived from different adult and fetal tissues. As a result, we observed a characteristic ubiquitous expression pattern for all the genes except for ATG2A, ATG9B, and WIPI2. In particular, ATG2A was the only upregulated gene in the etoposide-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. ATG2A mRNA was also upregulated by doxorubicin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 13 out of 23 human ATG gene promoters were regulated by the transcription factor E2F1 in HeLa cells, indicating that these constructs could be useful for examining how the autophagy pathway is involved in other cellular phenomena, such as apoptosis evoked by various stimuli. Taken together, these results suggest that autophagy might be regulated at both the transcriptional level and the post-translational level. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Time-dependent regulation analysis is a new methodology that allows us to unravel, both quantitatively and dynamically, how and when functional changes in the cell are brought about by the interplay of gene expression and metabolism. In this first experimental implementation, we dissect the initial and late response of baker's yeast upon a switch from glucose-limited growth to nitrogen starvation. During nitrogen starvation, unspecific bulk degradation of cytosolic proteins and small organelles (autophagy) occurs. If this is the primary cause of loss of glycolytic capacity, one would expect the cells to regulate their glycolytic capacity through decreasing simultaneously and proportionally the capacities of the enzymes in the first hour of nitrogen starvation. This should lead to regulation of the flux which is initially dominated by changes in the enzyme capacity. However, metabolic regulation is also known to act fast. To analyse the interplay between autophagy and metabolism, we examined the first 4 h of nitrogen starvation in detail using time-dependent regulation analysis. Some enzymes were initially regulated more by a breakdown of enzyme capacity and only later through metabolic regulation. However, other enzymes were regulated metabolically in the first hours and then shifted towards regulation via enzyme capacity. We conclude that even initial regulation is subtle and governed by different molecular levels. © 2009 FEBS.

ABSTRACT: The drs gene is an apoptosis-inducing tumor suppressor. Previously, we showed that drs contributes to the suppression of tumor formation by generating drs-knockout mice. In this study, by using drs KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that drs is involved in the autophagy regulation under low serum culture conditions. Both electron microscopy and GFP-LC3 analyses demonstrated that drs is involved in the maturation process of autophagy from autophagosomes to autolysosomes. In addition, drs could associate with Rab24 and the association between drs and Rab24 was enhanced during autophagy. Drs was also co-localized with Rab24 on punctuated structures during autophagy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy (or self eating), a cellular recycling mechanism, became the center of interest and subject of intensive research in recent years. Development of new molecular techniques allowed the study of this biological phenomenon in various model organisms ranging from yeast to plants and mammals. Accumulating data provide evidence that autophagy is involved in a spectrum of biological mechanisms including plant growth, development, response to stress, and defense against pathogens. In this review, we briefly summarize general and plant-related autophagy studies, and explain techniques commonly used to study autophagy. We also try to extrapolate how autophagy techniques used in other organisms may be adapted to plant studies. © 2009 Géraldine Mitou et al.

ABSTRACT: To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae elaborates specialized infection structures called appressoria, which use enormous turgor to rupture the tough outer cuticle of a rice leaf. Here, we report the generation of a set of 22 isogenic M. oryzae mutants each differing by a single component of the predicted autophagic machinery of the fungus. Analysis of this set of targeted deletion mutants demonstrated that loss of any of the 16 genes necessary for nonselective macroautophagy renders the fungus unable to cause rice blast disease, due to impairment of both conidial programmed cell death and appressorium maturation. In contrast, genes necessary only for selective forms of autophagy, such as pexophagy and mitophagy, are dispensable for appressorium-mediated plant infection. A genome-wide analysis therefore demonstrates the importance of infection-associated, nonselective autophagy for the establishment of rice blast disease.

ABSTRACT: Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a regulator of cell growth. TOR activity can also enhance cell death, and the TOR inhibitor rapamycin protects cells against proapoptotic stimuli. Autophagy, which can protect against cell death, is negatively regulated by TOR, and disruption of autophagy by mutation of Atg5 or Atg7 can lead to neurodegeneration. However, the implied functional connection between TOR signaling, autophagy, and cell death or degeneration has not been rigorously tested. Using the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, we show in this study that hyperactivation hyperactivation of TOR leads to photoreceptor cell death in an age- and light-dependent manner and that this is because of TOR's ability to suppress autophagy. We also find that genetically inhibiting TOR or inducing autophagy suppresses cell death in Drosophila models of Huntington's disease and phospholipase C (norpA)-mediated retinal degeneration. Thus, our data indicate that TOR induces cell death by suppressing autophagy and provide direct genetic evidence that autophagy alleviates cell death in several common types of neurodegenerative disease. © 2009 Wang et al.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a conserved proteolytic mechanism that degrades cytoplasmic material including cell organelles. The importance of autophagy for cell homeostasis and survival has long been appreciated. Recent data suggest that autophagy is also involved in non-metabolic functions that particularly concern blood cells. Here, we review these findings, which point to an important role of autophagy in several cellular functions related to host defense. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy or "self-eating" digests proteins and functionless cell organelles to reuse. This cell-own recycling system attracts much attention in tumour biology. One of the major functions of autophagy is maintaining cellular homeostasis. Thus, it is constitutive active in all living cells. Damaged or dispensable proteins and organelles are removed to regulate composition and size of the cytoplasm. Many therapeutic treatments have been shown to modulate autophagy signalling although it is still unclear if autophagy represents a survival or a suicide mechanism for tumour cells. Tumour growth in response to blocked autophagy as well as tumour growth in response to induced autophagy has been described. Several recent review articles address the differential effect of autophagy manipulation to apoptosis signalling. However, less has been reported about interactions of autophagy manipulation to the outcome of cancer therapy and tumour growth. Therefore, this review tries to fill this gap. We discuss data demonstrating that cellular decisions to autophagy manipulation depend on tumour type, stage, microenvironment, autophagy initiator or inhibitor and combined tumour treatment. Finally, we come to the conclusion that further analyses are necessary before manipulation of autophagic mechanisms can find its way into tumour therapy for improved treatment of patients. © 2009 UICC.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a tightly regulated cell self-eating process. It has been shown to be associated with various neuropathological conditions and therefore, traditionally known as a stress-induced process. Recent studies, however, reveal that autophagy is constitutively active in healthy neurons. Neurons are highly specialized, post-mitotic cells that are typically composed of a soma (cell body), a dendritic tree, and an axon. Despite the vast growth of our current knowledge of autophagy, the detailed process in such a highly differentiated cell type remains elusive. Current evidence strongly suggests that autophagy is uniquely regulated in neurons and is also highly adapted to local physiology in the axons. In addition, the molecular mechanism for basal autophagy in neurons may be significantly divergent from "classical" induced autophagy. A considerable number of studies have increasingly shown an important role for autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases and have explored autophagy as a potential drug target. Thus, understanding the neuronal autophagy process will ultimately aid in drug target identification and rational design of drug screening to combat neurodegenerative diseases. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an ancient pathway required for cell and tissue homeostasis and differentiation. Initially thought to be a process leading to cell death, autophagy is currently viewed as a beneficial catabolic process that promotes cell survival under starvation conditions by sequestering components of the cytoplasm, including misfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and damaged organelles, and targeting them for lysosome-mediated degradation. In this way, autophagy plays a role in maintaining a balance between degradation and recycling of cellular material. The importance of autophagy is underscored by the fact that malfunctioning of this pathway results in neurodegeneration, cancer, susceptibility to microbial infection, and premature aging. Autophagy occurs in almost all cell types, including immune cells. Recent advances in the field suggest that autophagy plays a central role in regulating the immune system at multiple levels. In this review, we focus on recent developments in the area of autophagy-mediated modulation of immune responses. © Current Medicine Group, LLC 2009.

ABSTRACT: Intracellular pathogens like Shigella flexneri enter host cells by phagocytosis. Once inside, the pathogen breaks the vacuolar membrane for cytosolic access. The fate and function of the vacuolar membrane remnants are not clear. Examining Shigella-infected nonmyeloid cells, we observed that proteins associated with vacuolar membrane remnants are polyubiquinated, recruit the autophagy marker LC3 and adaptor p62, and are targeted to autophagic degradation. Further, inflammasome components and caspase-1 were localized to these membranes and correlated with dampened inflammatory response and necrotic cell death. In Atg4B mutant cells in which autophagosome maturation is blocked, polyubiquitinated proteins and P62 accumulated on membrane remnants, and as in autophagy-deficient Atg5<sup>-/-</sup> cells, the early inflammatory and cytokine response was exacerbated. Our results suggest that host membranes, after rupture by an invading cytoplasm-targeted bacterium, contribute to the cellular responses to infection by acting as a signaling node, with autophagy playing a central role in regulating these responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Our previous work has shown that autophagy plays a pro-survival function in two necrotic cell death models: zVAD-treated L929 cells as well as H <sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated Bax<sup>-/-</sup>Bak<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (DKO MEF). This study aims to further explore the regulatory role of autophagy in necrosis by examining the functional role of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Our initial intriguing finding was that insulin is able to promote necrotic cell death induced by zVAD and MNNG in L929 cells or by H <sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in DKO MEF cells cultured in full-growth medium. The pro-necrosis function of insulin was further supported by the observations that insulin is capable of abolishing the protective effect of starvation on necrotic cell death induced by zVAD in L929 cells. Next, we demonstrated that insulin acts on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway to promote necrosis as the suppression of the above pathway by either chemical inhibitors (LY294002 and rapamycin) or mTOR knockdown is able to mitigate the pro-death function of insulin. Finally, we provided evidence that the pro-death function of insulin is dependent on its inhibitory effect on autophagy, which serves as an important pro-survival function in necrosis. Taken together, here we provide compelling evidence to show that activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway can promote necrotic cell death via suppression of autophagy, at least in the necrosis models defined in our study in which autophagy serves as a pro-survival function. Data from this study not only further underscore the pro-survival function of autophagy in necrotic cell death, but also provide a novel insight into the intricate connections linking the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway with cell death via modulation of autophagy. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved cellular process during which cytoplasmic material is engulfed in double membrane vacuoles that then fuse with lysosomes, ultimately degrading their cargo. Emerging evidence, however, now suggests that autophagy can form part of our innate and adaptive immune defense programs. Recent studies have identified pattern recognition molecules as mediators of this process and shown that intracellular pathogens can interact with and even manipulate autophagy. Recent translational evidence has also implicated autophagy in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases, including Crohn disease. In this review, we present autophagy in the context of its role as an immune system component and effector and speculate on imminent and future research directions in this field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is emerging as an important process in plant infection by pathogenic fungi, which develop differentiated infection cells to breach the plant cuticle. Conversely, autophagic processes are also important in the defence responses of plants that are able to perceive and react to invading pathogens. The pivotal role of autophagy in both fungal pathogenesis and disease resistance is linked to its function in the regulation of programmed cell death which is a key component of plant immunity responses and fungal infection-related development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In filamentous ascomycetes, autophagy is involved in several developmental processes. Nevertheless, until now little is known about its role in fruiting-body development. We therefore isolated a gene of the homothallic ascomycete Sordaria macrospora with high sequence similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae autophagy-related gene ATG7, encoding a core autophagy regulator. This is the first characterization of an ATG7 homolog in filamentous ascomycetes. A S. cerevisiae complementation assay demonstrated that the S. macrospora Smatg7 gene functionally replaces the yeast homolog. We were not able to generate a homokaryotic knock-out mutant in S. macrospora, suggesting that Smatg7 is required for viability. However, a heterokaryotic ΔSmatg7/Smatg7 strain and transformants generated by RNA interference showed considerable morphological phenotypes during fruiting-body development. Using real-time PCR, we demonstrated that in the wild type, the transcriptional expression of Smatg7 is markedly up-regulated under amino acid starvation conditions and at late stages during sexual development. Moreover, we showed that transcriptionally down-regulation of Smatg7 disturbs autophagy in S. macrospora. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: HYD1 is a D-amino acid peptide that was previously shown to inhibit adhesion of prostate cancer cells to the extracellular matrix. In this study, we show that in addition to inhibiting adhesion of multiple myeloma (MM) cells to fibronectin, HYD1 induces cell death in MM cells as a single agent. HYD1-induced cell death was necrotic in nature as shown by: (a) decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<sub>Ψm</sub>), (b) loss of total cellular ATP, and (c) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, HYD1 treatment does not result in apoptotic cell death because it did not trigger the activation of caspases or the release of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G from the mitochondria, nor did it induce double-stranded DNA breaks. HYD1 did initiate autophagy in cells; however, autophagy was found to be an adaptive response contributing to cell survival rather than the cause of cell death. We were further able to show that N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a thiol-containing free radical scavenger, partially protects MM cells from HYD1-induced death. Additionally, N-acetyl-L-cysteine blocked HYD1-induced as well as basal levels of autophagy, suggesting that ROS can potentially trigger both cell death and cell survival pathways. Taken together, our data describe an important role of ROS in HYD1-induced necrotic cell death in MM cells. Copyright © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

ABSTRACT: In this article we provide an overview of the intersection between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the autophagy pathway and discuss the potential protective effects of lithium through mechanisms that recruit autophagy and other effects. The autophagy pathway is recruited during motor neuron (MN) death both in vitro and in vivo. Despite a few controversial issues concerning the significance (detrimental/protective) of autophagy in ALS, recent findings indicate a protective role. Lithium in low doses is a well-known autophagy inducer that clears misfolded proteins and altered mitochondria from MNs. Moreover, lithium preserves mitochondria and sustains their genesis. This effect is replicated by rapamycin, which is an autophagy inducer but with a different mechanism from lithium. Lithium also increases the number of Renshaw cells that are affected early during the progression of experimental ALS. Again, lithium has been reported to decrease glial proliferation in the ALS spinal cord and induces sprouting in corticospinal fibers. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cytoplasmic degradative pathway that can participate in biosynthetic processes, as in the yeast Cvt pathway, but is more commonly known for its functions in removing damaged or surplus organelles and macromolecular complexes. Here, we find that autophagy intersects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) biogenesis, mirroring the above dichotomy. Early, nondegradative stages of autophagy promoted HIV yields. HIV Gagderived proteins colocalized and interacted with the autophagy factor LC3, and autophagy promoted productive Gag processing. Nevertheless, when autophagy progressed through maturation stages, HIV was degraded. This, however, does not occur, as the HIV protein Nef acts as an antiautophagic maturation factor through interactions with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin 1, thus protecting HIV from degradation. The dual interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by using the early stages while inhibiting the late stages of autophagy. The role of Nef in the latter process enhances yields of infectious HIV and may be of significance for progression to clinical AIDS. © 2009 Kyei et al.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a fundamental function of eukaryotic cells and is well conserved from yeast to humans. The most remarkable feature of autophagy is the synthesis of double membrane-bound compartments that sequester materials to be degraded in lytic compartments, a process that seems to be mechanistically distinct from conventional membrane traffic. The discovery of autophagy in yeast and the genetic tractability of this organism have allowed us to identify genes that are responsible for this process, which has led to the explosive growth of this research field seen today. Analyses of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins have unveiled dynamic and diverse aspects of mechanisms that underlie membrane formation during autophagy. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: The proteasome and the autophagy systems are two evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for degrading intracellular materials. They are functionally coupled and suppression of the proteasome promotes autophagy. Although suppression of the proteasome leads to cell death, suppression of autophagy can be either prodeath or prosurvival. To understand the underlining mechanism of this dichotomy and its potential clinical implications, we treated various transformed and nontransformed human cells with proteasome inhibitors. We found that whether autophagy served a prosurvival role in this scenario was contingent on the cellular oncogenic status. Thus, autophagy suppression enhanced apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors in transformed cells, but not in nontransformed cells. Oncogenic transformation enhanced the ability of cells to initiate autophagy in response to stress, reflecting a stronger dependence of transformed cells on autophagy for survival. Indeed, a combined use of bortezomib, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved proteasome inhibitor for clinical use, and chloroquine, which inhibits autophagy by disturbing lysosomal functions, suppressed tumor growth more significantly than either agent alone in a xenograft model. These findings indicate that suppression of both intracellular degradation systems could constitute a novel strategy for enhanced cancer control in a tumor-specific way.

ABSTRACT: Apoptosis and autophagic cell deaths are programmed cell deaths and they play essential roles in cell survival, growth and development and tumorigenesis. The huge increase of publications in both apoptosis and autophagic signaling pathways has contributed to the wealth of knowledge in facilitating the understanding of cancer pathogenesis. Deciphering the molecular pathways and molecules involved in these pathways has helped scientists devise and develop targeted strategies against cancer. Various drugs targeting the apoptotic TRAIL, Bcl-2 and proteasome pathways are already in Phase II/III clinical trials. The first mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus has already been approved by the FDA, USA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and more mTOR inhibitors are expected to be in the market in a few years time. Strategizing against aberrant autophagy activities in various cancers by using either pro-autophagics or autophagy inhibitors are currently been investigated. This review aims to discuss the most recent antitumor strategies targeting the apoptosis and autophagy signaling pathways and the latest outcome of clinical trials of the above drugs. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Background: Previous study reported that resveratrol has anti-tumor activity. In this study, we investigated the involvement of autophagy in the resveratrol-induced apoptotic death of human U251 glioma cells. Methods: The growth inhibition of U251 cells induced by resveratrol was assessed with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The activation of autophagy and proapoptotic effect were characterized by monodansylcadaverine labeling and Hoechst stain, respectively. Mitochondrialtransmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured as a function of drug treatment using 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). The role of autophagy and apoptosis in the resveratrol-induced death of U251 cells was assessed using autophagic and caspase inhibitors. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis were used to study the apoptotic and autophagic mechanisms. Results: Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays indicated that resveratrol decreased the viability of U251 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that resveratrol increased cell population at sub-G1 phase, an index of apoptosis. Furthermore, resveratrol-induced cell death was associated with a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk suppressed resveratrol-induced U251 cell death. Resveratrol stimulated autophagy was evidenced by punctuate monodansylcadaverine(MDC) staining and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) immunoreactivty. Resveratrol also increased protein levels of beclin 1 and membrane form LC3 (LC3-II). Autophagy inhibitors 3-methylademine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 sensitized the cytotoxicity of resveratrol. Conclusion: Together, these findings indicate that resveratrol induces autophagy in human U251 glioma cells and autophagy suppressed resveratrol-induced apoptosis. This study thus suggests that autophagy inhibitors can increase the cytotoxicity of resveratrol to glioma cells. © 2009 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation, which is likely to represent an innate adaptation to starvation. In times of nutrient deficiency, the cell can self-digest and recycle some nonessential components through nonselective autophagy, thus sustaining minimal growth requirements until a food source becomes available. Over recent years, autophagy has been implicated in an increasing number of clinical scenarios, notably infectious diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmunity. The recent identification of the importance of autophagy genes in the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease suggests that a selective autophagic response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of common complex immune-mediated diseases. In this review, we discuss the autophagic mechanisms, their molecular regulation, and summarize their clinical relevance. This progress has led to great interest in the therapeutic potential of manipulation of both selective and nonselective autophagy in established disease.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a dynamic process involving the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic organelles and proteins. Based on the function of "cellular recycling", autophagy plays key roles in the quality control of cellular components as well as supplying nutrients and materials for newly constructed structures in cells under metabolic stresses. The physiological relevance of autophagy in tumor formation and progression is still controversial. The cytoprotective function of autophagy in cells subjected to starvation might enhance the prolonged survival of tumor cells that are often exposed to metabolic stresses in vivo. Meanwhile, a tumor-suppressive function of autophagy has also been suggested. Autophagy-related cell death has been regarded as a primary mechanism for tumor suppression. In addition, the loss of autophagy induced genome instability and significant necrosis with inflammation in transplanted mouse tumor models, suggesting an additional function of autophagy in the suppression of tumor formation and growth. Until now, investigations supporting and proving the above possibilities have not been fully completed using clinical samples and equivalent animal models. Though monitoring and the interpretation of autophagy dynamism in tumor tissues are still technically difficult, identifying the autophagic activity in clinical samples might be necessary to clarify the pathophysiological relevance of autophagy in tumor formation and progression as well as to develop new therapeutic strategies based on the regulation of autophagy. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Human genomic data of many types are readily available, but the complexity and scale of human molecular biology make it difficult to integrate this body of data, understand it from a systems level, and apply it to the study of specific pathways or genetic disorders. An investigator could best explore a particular protein, pathway, or disease if given a functional map summarizing the data and interactions most relevant to his or her area of interest. Using a regularized Bayesian integration system, we provide maps of functional activity and interaction networks in over 200 areas of human cellular biology, each including information from ∼30,000 genome-scale experiments pertaining to ∼25,000 human genes. Key to these analyses is the ability to efficiently summarize this large data collection from a variety of biologically informative perspectives: prediction of protein function and functional modules, cross-talk among biological processes, and association of novel genes and pathways with known genetic disorders. In addition to providing maps of each of these areas, we also identify biological processes active in each data set. Experimental investigation of five specific genes, AP3B1, ATP6AP1, BLOC1S1, LAMP2, and RAB11A, has confirmed novel roles for these proteins in the proper initiation of macroautophagy in amino acid-starved human fibroblasts. Our functional maps can be explored using HEFalMp (Human Experimental/Functional Mapper), a web interface allowing interactive visualization and investigation of this large body of information. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a bulk lysosomal degradation process important in development, differentiation and cellular homeostasis in multiple organs. Interestingly, neuronal survival is highly dependent on autophagy due to its post-mitotic nature, polarized morphology and active protein trafficking. A growing body of evidence now suggests that alteration or dysfunction of autophagy causes accumulation of abnormal proteins and/or damaged organelles, thereby leading to neurodegenerative disease. Although autophagy generally prevents neuronal cell death, it plays a protective or detrimental role in neurodegenerative disease depending on the environment. In this review, the two sides of autophagy will be discussed in the context of several neurodegenerative diseases. [BMB reports 2009; 42(6): 324-330].

ABSTRACT: Type I collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix, and mutations in the collagen gene cause several matrix-associated diseases. These mutant procollagens are misfolded and often aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the misfolded procollagens are potentially toxic to the cell, little is known about how they are eliminated from the ER. Here, we show that procollagen that can initially trimerize but then aggregates in the ER are eliminated by an autophagy-lysosome pathway, but not by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by specific inhibitors or RNAi-mediated knockdown of an autophagy-related gene significantly stimulated accumulation of aggregated procollagen trimers in the ER, and activation of autophagy with rapamycin resulted in reduced amount of aggregates. In contrast, a mutant procollagen which has a compromised ability to form trimers was degraded by ERAD. Moreover, we found that autophagy plays an essential role in protecting cells against the toxicity of the ERAD-inefficient procollagen aggregates. The autophagic elimination of aggregated procollagen occurs independently of the ERAD system. These results indicate that autophagy is a final cell protection strategy deployed against ER-accumulated cytotoxic aggregates that are not able to be removed by ERAD. © 2009 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy and proteasomal degradation constitute the two main catabolic pathways in cells. While the proteasome degrades primarily short-lived soluble proteins, macroautophagy, the main constitutive autophagic pathway, delivers cell organelles and protein aggregates for lysosomal degradation. Both the proteasome and macroautophagy are attractive effector mechanisms for the immune system because they can be used to degrade foreign substances, including pathogenic proteins, within cells. Therefore, both innate and adaptive immune responses use these pathways for intracellular clearance of pathogens as well as for presentation of pathogen fragments to the adaptive immune system. Because, however, the same mechanisms are used for the steady-state turnover of cellular self-components, the immune system has to be desensitized not to recognize these. Therefore, proteasomal degradation and macroautophagy are also involved in tolerizing the immune system prior to pathogen encounter. We will discuss recent advances in our understanding how macroautophagy selects self-structures in the steady state, how presentation of these on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules leads to tolerance and how macroautophagy assists both innate and adaptive immunity. This new knowledge on the specialized functions of the metabolic process macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes should allow us to target it for therapy development against immunopathologies and to improve vaccinations. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.

ABSTRACT: The binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin-1 reduces Beclin-1's capacity to induce autophagy. Here, we have tested whether the interaction is reciprocated by loss of Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function. We targeted Bcl-2 to mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induced apoptosis using several apoptotic stimuli that initiate ER and/or mitochondrial signaling pathways (UV radiation, TNF and cycloheximide, staurosporine, thapsigargin and tunicamycin). When Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 were expressed together in HeLa cells, Beclin-1 (but not Beclin-1 lacking the Bcl-2-binding domain) followed Bcl-2 to the appropriate organelle with complete or near-complete overlap (comprising 60 and 30% of cells, respectively). The interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 was verified by immunoprecipitation, and a membrane-proximate localization of Beclin-1 was shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Apoptosis was followed by measuring changes in nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activity, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage or punctation of mRFP-Bax on mitochondria. Binding of Beclin-1 to Bcl-2 did not modify apoptosis irrespective of Bcl-2 concentration, location or apoptotic stimulus. A similar result was obtained in Atg5/ cells that are autophagy-deficient, arguing against compensation for the loss of protection by Bcl-2 by autophagy-mediated survival induced by Beclin-1. Hence, although Beclin-1 contains a BH3-only motif typical of pro-apoptotic proteins, it is a negligible modulator of Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: The analysis of autophagy in cells and tissue has principally been performed via qualitative measures. These assays identify autophagosomes or measure the conversion of LC3I to LC3II. However, qualitative assays fail to quantitate the degradation of an autophagic substrate and therefore only indirectly measure an intact autophagic system. "Autophagic flux" can be measured using long-lived proteins that are degraded via autophagy. We developed a quantifiable luciferase reporter assay that measures the degradation of a long-lived polyglutamine protein aggregate, polyQ80-luciferase. Using this reporter, the induction of autophagy via starvation or rapamycin in cells preferentially decreases polyQ80-luciferase when compared with a nonaggregating polyQ19-luciferase after four hours of treatment. This response was both time- and concentration-dependent, prevented by autophagy inhibitors and absent in ATG5 knockout cells. We adapted this assay to living animals by electroporating polyQ19-luciferase and polyQ80-luciferase expression constructs into the right and left tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mice, respectively. The change in the ratio of polyQ80-luciferase to polyQ19-luciferase signal before and after autophagic stimulation or inhibition was quantified via in vivo bioluminescent imaging. Following two days of starvation or treatment with intraperitoneal rapamycin, there was a ∼35% reduction in the ratio of polyQ80:polyQ19- luciferase activity, consistent with the selective autophagic degradation of polyQ80 protein. This autophagic response in skeletal muscle in vivo was abrogated by co-treatment with chloroquine and in ATG16L1 hypomorphic mice. Our study demonstrates a method to quantify the autophagic flux of an expanded polyglutamine via luciferase reporters in vitro and in vivo. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy mediates the bulk turnover of cytoplasmic constituents in lysosomes. During embryonic development in animals, a dramatic degradation of yolk proteins and synthesis of zygotic proteins takes place, leading to intracellular remodeling and cellular differentiation. Zebrafish represents a unique system to study autophagy due in part to its rapid embryonic development relative to other vertebrates. The technical advantages of this organism make it uniquely suited to various studies including high-throughput drug screens. To study autophagy in zebrafish, we identified two zebrafish Atg8 homologs, lc3 and gabarap, and generated two transgenic zebrafish lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of the corresponding proteins. Similar to yeast Atg8 and mammalian LC3, zebrafish Lc3 undergoes post-translational modification starting at the pharyngula stage during embryonic development. We observed a high level of autophagy activity in zebrafish embryos, which can be further upregulated by the TOR inhibitor rapamycin or the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. In addition, zebrafish Gabarap accumulates within lysosomes upon autophagy induction. Thus, we established a convenient zebrafish tool to assay autophagic activity during embryogenesis in vivo. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: The oncosuppressor protein p53 regulates autophagy in a dual fashion. The pool of cytoplasmic p53 protein represses autophagy in a transcription- independent fashion, while the pool of nuclear p53 stimulates autophagy through the transactivation of specific genes. Here we report the discovery that Sestrin2, a novel p53 target gene, is involved in the induction of autophagy. Depletion of Sestrin2 by RNA interference reduced the level of autophagy in a panel of p53-sufficient human cancer cell lines responding to distinct autophagy inducers. In quantitative terms, Sestrin2 depletion was as efficient in preventing autophagy induction as was the depletion of Dram, another p53 target gene. Knockout of either Sestrin2 or Dram reduced autophagy elicited by nutrient depletion, rapamycin, lithium or thapsigargin. Moreover, autophagy induction by nutrient depletion or pharmacological stimuli led to an increase in Sestrin2 expression levels in p53-proficient cells. In strict contrast, the depletion of Sestrin2 or Dram failed to affect autophagy in p53-deficient cells and did not modulate the inhibition of baseline autophagy by a cytoplasmic p53 mutant that was reintroduced into p53-deficient cells. We conclude that Sestrin2 acts as a positive regulator of autophagy in p53-proficient cells. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Anticancer drug-induced tumor suppression may involve mechanisms of protection against neoplastic transformation that are normally latent in mammalian cells and consist in a genetic program implemented during anti-tumoral defense. This defense program results in the self elimination of cells harboring potentially dangerous mutations by triggering cell death through apoptosis and/or autophagy or in the execution of a program that leads to a permanent growth arrest known as senescence. These responses are considered crucial tumor suppressive mechanisms and their study appears to be essential to develop therapeutical procedures based on the enhancement of the different responses. This review summarizes fundamental knowledge on the underlying mechanisms able to limit excessive or aberrant cellular proliferation and on the prognostic value of both apoptosis and senescence detection. In addition, interesting evidence showing that different drugs induce senescence or cell death depending on the genetic features of the tumor cells as well as on the integrity of the relative pathways is reported. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Imatinib mesylate (IM), a potent inhibitor of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase, has become standard first-line therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but the frequency of resistance increases in advancing stages of disease. Elimination of BCR/ABL-dependent intracellular signals triggers apoptosis, but it is unclear whether this activates additional cell survival and/or death pathways. We have shown here that IM induces autophagy in CML blast crisis cell lines, CML primary cells, and p210BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid precursor cells. IM-induced autophagy did not involve c-Abl or Bcl-2 activity but was associated with ER stress and was suppressed by depletion of intracellular Ca2+, suggesting it is mechanistically nonoverlapping with IM-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that suppression of autophagy using either pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference of essential autophagy genes enhanced cell death induced by IM in cell lines and primary CML cells. Critically, the combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), i.e., IM, nilotinib, or dasatinib, with inhibitors of autophagy resulted in near complete elimination of phenotypically and functionally defined CML stem cells. Together, these findings suggest that autophagy inhibitors may enhance the therapeutic effects of TKIs in the treatment of CML.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is the regulated process cells use to recycle nonessential, redundant, or inefficient components and is an adaptive response during times of stress. In addition to its function in enabling the cell to gain vital nutrients in times of stress, autophagy can also be involved in elimination of intracellular microorganisms, tumor suppression, and antigen presentation. Because of difficulty in diagnosing autophagy, few clinical studies have been performed. This study examined whether autophagy occurs in hepatocytes during sepsis. Electron microscopy (EM) was performed on liver samples obtained from both an observational clinical cohort of six septic patients and four control patients as well as liver specimens from mice with surgical sepsis (by cecal ligation and puncture) or sham operation. EM demonstrated increased autophagic vacuoles in septic vs nonseptic patients. Randomly selected fields (3000μm<sup>2</sup>) from control and septic patients contained 1.2±1.5 vs 5.3±3.3 (mean±s.d.) complex lysosomal autophagolysosomal structures per image respectively (P0.001). In rare instances, hepatocytes with autophagic vacuoles appeared to be unequivocally committed to death. Membrane alterations (membrane vacuoles, invagination into adjacent organelles, and myelin figure-like changes) occur in a subpopulation of mitochondria in sepsis, but other hepatocyte organelles showed no consistent ultrastructural injury. Findings in murine sepsis paralleled those of patients, with 7.2±1.9 vs 38.7±3.9 lysosomal autophagolysosomal structures in sham and septic mice, respectively (P 0.002). Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that sepsis induced the upregulation of select apoptosis and cytokine gene expression with minimal changes in the core autophagy genes in liver. In conclusion, hepatocyte autophagic vacuolization increases during sepsis and is associated with mitochondrial injury. However, it is not possible to determine whether the increase in autophagic vacuolization is an adaptive response or a harbinger of cell death.© 2009 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In traumatic brain injury (TBI), the primary, irreversible damage associated with the moment of impact consists of cells dying from necrosis. This contributes to fuelling a chronic central nervous system (CNS) inflammation with increased formation of proinflammatory cytokines, enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS promote oxidative stress, which leads to neurodegeneration and ultimately results in programmed cell death (secondary injury). Since this delayed, secondary tissue loss occurs days to months following the primary injury it provides a therapeutic window where potential neuroprotective treatment could alleviate ongoing neurodegeneration, cell death and neurological impairment following TBI. Various neuroprotective drug candidates have been described, tested and proven effective in pre-clinical studies, including glutamate receptor antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, and caspase inhibitors. However, most of the scientific efforts have failed in translating the experimental results into clinical trials. Despite intensive research, effective neuroprotective therapies are lacking in the clinic, and TBI continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This paper provides an overview of the TBI pathophysiology leading to cell death and neurological impairment. We also discuss endogenously expressed neuroprotectants and drug candidates, which at this stage may still hold the potential for treating brain injured patients. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy, an intracellular degradative pathway, maintains cell homeostasis under normal and stress conditions. Nascent double-membrane autophagosomes sequester and enclose cytosolic components and organelles, and subsequently fuse with the endosomal pathway allowing content degradation. Autophagy requires fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes, but it is not known if fusion with early endosomes is essential. We show that fusion of AVs with functional early endosomes is required for autophagy. Inhibition of early endosome function by loss of COPI subunits ((3', (3, or a) results in accumulation of autophagosomes, but not an increased autophagic fux. COPI is required for ER-Golgi transport and early endosome maturation. Although loss of COPI results in the fragmentation of the Golgi, this does not induce the formation of autophagosomes. Loss of COPI causes defects in early endosome function, as both transferrin recycling and EGF internalization and degradation are impaired, and this loss of function causes an inhibition of autophagy, an accumulation of p62/SQSTM-1, and ubiquitinated proteins in autophagosomes. © 2009 Razi et al.

ABSTRACT: Liver cancer is the predominant cause of cancer mortality in males of Southern China and Taiwan. The current therapy is not satisfactory, and more effective treatments are needed. In the search for new therapies for liver tumor, we found that Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin from Jack bean seeds, can have a potent anti-hepatoma effect. Con A after binding to the mannose moiety on the cell membrane glycoprotein is internalized preferentially to the mitochondria. An autophagy is triggered which leads to cell death. Con A as a T cell mitogen subsequently activates the immune response in the liver and results in the eradication of the tumor in a murine in situ hepatoma model. The liver tumor nodule formation is inhibited by the CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, and a tumor antigen-specific immune memory is established during the hepatic inflammation. The dual properties (autophagic cytotoxicity and immunomodulation) via the specific carbohydrate binding let Con A exert a potent anti-hepatoma therapeutic effect. The novel mechanism of the Con A anti-hepatoma effect is discussed. The prototype of Con with an anti-hepatoma activity gives support to the search for other natural lectins as anti-cancer compounds.

ABSTRACT: Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal accumulation of the mutant protein huntingtin. Improving clearance of the mutant protein is expected to prevent cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration in HD. We report here that such clearance can be achieved by posttranslational modification of the mutant Huntingtin (Htt) by acetylation at lysine residue 444 (K444). Increased acetylation at K444 facilitates trafficking of mutant Htt into autophagosomes, significantly improves clearance of the mutant protein by macroautophagy, and reverses the toxic effects of mutant huntingtin in primary striatal and cortical neurons and in a transgenic C. elegans model of HD. In contrast, mutant Htt that is rendered resistant to acetylation dramatically accumulates and leads to neurodegeneration in cultured neurons and in mouse brain. These studies identify acetylation as a mechanism for removing accumulated protein in HD, and more broadly for actively targeting proteins for degradation by autophagy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: APO866 inhibits nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), a key enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis from the natural precursor nicotinamide.Intracellular NAD is essential for cell survival, and NAD depletion resulting from APO866 treatment elicits tumor cell death. Here, we determine the in vitro and in vivo sensitivities of hematologic cancer cells to APO866 using a panel of cell lines (n = 45) and primary cells (n = 32). Most cancer cells (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], and T-cell lymphoma), but not normal hemato- poietic progenitor cells, were sensitive to low concentrations of APO866 as measured in cytotoxicity and clonogenic assays. Treatment with APO866 decreased intracellular NAD and adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) at 24 hours and 48 to 72 hours, respectively. The NAD depletion led to cell death. At 96 hours, APO866- mediated cell death occurred in a caspase-independent mode, and was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy. Further, in vivo administration of APO866 as a single agent prevented and abrogated tumor growth in animal models of human AML, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and leukemia without significant toxicity to the animals. The results support the potential of APO866 for treating hematologic malignancies. © 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a physiological and evolutionarily conserved process maintaining homeostatic functions, such as protein degradation and organelle turnover. Accumulating data provide evidence that autophagy also contributes to cell death under certain circumstances, but how this is achieved is not well known. Herein, we report that autophagy occurs during developmentally-induced cell death in the female germline, observed in the germarium and during middle developmental stages of oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Degenerating germline cells exhibit caspase activation, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and punctate staining of mCherry-DrAtg8a, a novel marker for monitoring autophagy in Drosophila. Genetic inhibition of autophagy, by removing atgl or atg7 function, results in significant reduction of DNA fragmentation, suggesting that autophagy acts genetically upstream of DNA fragmentation in this tissue. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell death in vivo during development. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is believed to be important in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, the role of autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and especially the prognostic value of autophagic proteins, has not been investigated. Our studies described here show decreased basal expression of autophagic genes and their corresponding autophagic activity under conditions of starvation in HCC cell lines, and the autophagy defect correlated well with the highly malignant phenotype of HCC. In addition, in a tissue microarray study of HCC patients who underwent resection, the expression of the autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 was extremely low in tumors, where Beclin 1 could predict the prognosis of HCC patients only in a Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>-positive expression background. Based on our results, we propose that autophagy defects that synergize with altered apoptotic activity might facilitate tumor progression and poor prognosis of HCC, due to the fact that autophagy may interact with apoptosis in the regulation of HCC. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Mounting evidence indicates that alterations of autophagy processes are directly involved in the development of many human diseases, including cancers. Autophagy-related gene (ATG) products are main players in the autophagy process. In humans there are 16 known ATG genes, of which four (ATG2B, ATG5, ATG9B and ATG12) have mononucleotide repeats with seven or more nucleotides. Frameshift mutations of genes with mononucleotide repeats are features of cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI). It is not known whether ATG genes with mononucleotide repeats are altered by frameshift mutations in gastric and colorectal carcinomas with MSI. For this, we analysed the mononecleotide repeats in ATG2B, ATG5, ATG9B and ATG12 in 32 gastric carcinomas with high MSI (MSI-H), 13 gastric carcinomas with low MSI (MSI-L), 43 colorectal carcinomas with MSI-H and 15 colorectal carcinomas with MSI-L by a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We found ATG2B, ATG5, ATG9B and ATG12 mutations in 10, 2, 13 and 0 cancers, respectively. The mutations were detected in MSI-H cancers but not in MSI-L cancers. Gastric and colorectal cancers with MSI-H harboured one or more ATG mutations in 28.1% and 27.9%, respectively. Our data indicate that frameshift mutations in ATG genes with mononucleotide repeats are common in gastric and colorectal carcinomas with MSI-H, and suggest that these mutations may contribute to cancer development by deregulating the autophagy process.

ABSTRACT: Background Programmed cell death has been traditionally related with caspase activation. However, it is now accepted that caspase-independent forms of programmed cell death also regulate cell death. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD47 ligation induces one of these alternative forms of cell death: type III programmed cell death. This poorly understood process is characterized by cytoplasmic hallmarks, such as mitochondrial damage. To gain insights into the molecular pathways regulating type III programmed cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we performed extensive biochemical and cell biology assessments. Design and Methods After CD47 triggering, purified B-cells from 20 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were studied by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and three-dimensional imaging, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and fibrillar/globular actin measurements. Finally, we subjected CD47-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to a phagocytosis assay. Results We first confirmed that induction of type III programmed cell death is an efficient means of triggering cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Further, we demonstrated that the signaling events induced by CD47 ligation provoked a reduction in cell size. This alteration is related to F-actin disruption, as the two other cytoskeleton networks, microtubules and intermediate filaments, remain undisturbed in type III programmed cell death. Strikingly, we revealed that the pharmacological modulation of F-actin dynamics regulated this type of death. Finally, our data delineated a new programmed cell death pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia initiated by CD47 triggering, and followed by serine protease activation, F-actin rearrangement, mitochondrial damage, phosphatidylserine exposure, and cell clearance. Conclusions Our work reveals a key molecular tool in the modulation of cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: F-actin. By assessing the regulation of F-actin and type III programmed cell death, this analysis provides new options for destroying chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, such as a combination of therapies based on apoptosis regulators (e.g., caspases, Bcl- 2, Bax) along with alternative therapies based on type III death effectors (e.g., F-actin). © 2009 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

ABSTRACT: In a screening of 65 derivatives of natural quinones using bloodstream trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, the 3 naphthoimidazoles derived from β-lapachone - N1, N2 and N3 - were selected as the most active. Investigation of their mode of action led to the characterization of mitochondrion, reservosomes and DNA as their main targets, and stimulated further studies on death pathways. Ultrastructural analysis revealed both autophagic (autophagosomes) and apoptotic-like (membrane blebbing) phenotypes. Flow cytometry analysis showed, in N2-treated trypomastigotes, a small increase of phosphatidylserine exposure, and a large increase in the percentage of necrosis, caused by N1 or N2. These death phenotypes were not detected in treated epimastigotes. The strong increase in labelling of monodansyl cadaverine, the inhibition of the death process by wortmannin or 3-methyladenine, the overexpression of ATG genes in treated epimastigotes, together with ultrastructural evidence point to autophagy as the predominant phenotype induced by the naphthoimidazoles. However, there are other pathways occurring concomitantly with variable intensities, justifying the need to detail the molecular features involved. Copyright © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system, by which cytoplasmic contents are degraded in lysosomes. Autophagy is dynamically induced by nutrient depletion to provide necessary amino acids within cells, thus helping them adapt to starvation. Although it has been suggested that mTOR is a major negative regulator of autophagy, how it controls autophagy has not yet been determined. Here, we report a novel mammalian autophagy factor, Atg13, which forms a stable ∼3-MDa protein complex with ULK1 and FIP200. Atg13 localizes on the autophagic isolation membrane and is essential for autophagosome formation. In contrast to yeast counterparts, formation of the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex is not altered by nutrient conditions. Importantly, mTORC1 is incorporated into the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex through ULK1 in a nutrient-dependent manner and mTOR phosphorylates ULK1 and Atg13. ULK1 is dephosphorylated by rapamycin treatment or starvation. These data suggest that mTORC1 suppresses autophagy through direct regulation of the ∼3-MDa ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex. © 2009 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

ABSTRACT: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest cancers world-wide with an estimated annual incidence and mortality rates of approximately 6,500 cases in the UK, over 40,000 cases in Europe, 19,000 cases in Japan and over 30,000 cases in the United States. Difficulty to diagnose the disease at an early stage, rapid progression and intrinsic resistance to currently available therapies are major factors that contribute to poor disease outcome in these patients (overall 5 years survival, <3%). Identification of cancer cell-encoded genes that contribute to the development of intrinsic resistance and metastatic spread of the PDA tumors, may yield immediate clinical benefits in terms of revealing new therapeutic targets for effective treatment of the disease. This article discusses the significance of tissue-type transglutaminase (TG2) whose expression is elevated in the majority of PDA tumors and cell lines. Based on the published data and the results discussed in this review, TG2 appears to be a promising target for containment and treatment of this formidable disease. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) is a major regulator of apoptotic signaling. Through interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, it drives calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, thereby establishing a functional and physical link between these organelles. Importantly, the IP<sub>3</sub>R also regulates autophagy, and in particular, its inhibition/depletion strongly induces macroautophagy. Here, we show that the IP<sub>3</sub>R antagonist xestospongin B induces autophagy by disrupting a molecular complex formed by the IP<sub>3</sub> R and Beclin 1, an interaction that is increased or inhibited by overexpression or knockdown of Bcl-2, respectively. An effect of Beclin 1 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis was discarded as siRNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin 1 did not affect cytosolic or luminal ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Xestospongin B- or starvation-induced autophagy was inhibited by overexpression of the IP<sub>3</sub>R ligand-binding domain, which coimmunoprecipitated with Beclin 1. These results identify IP<sub>3</sub>R as a new regulator of the Beclin 1 complex that may bridge signals converging on the ER and initial phagophore formation.

ABSTRACT: The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders with typical autofluorescence material stored in tissues. Ten clinical NCL forms and eight causative genes are known. Mutations in CLN6 have been reported in roughly 30 patients, mostly in association with the variant late-infantile NCL (v-LINCL) phenotype. We screened CLN6 in 30 children from a cohort of 53 v-LINCL cases and revised their clinical and ultrastructural features. We detected 11 mutations, eight of which are novel, all predicting a direct impairing of the putative gene function. No clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were observed, with inter- and intra-familial variability evident for few recurrent mutations. Ultrastructural findings were suggestive of an impaired regulation of the autophagic vacuoles turnover. While expanding the array of CLN6 mutations, we showed that more than half of our v-LINCL cases lack a DNA confirmation and further molecular etiologies are to be searched. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorder characterized by T cell-mediated demyelination. In MS, prolonged T cell survival and increased T cell proliferation have been linked to disease relapse and progression. Recently, the autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) has been shown to modulate T cell survival. In this study, we examined the expression of Atg5 using both a mouse model of autoimmune demyelination as well as blood and brain tissues from MS cases. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RNA isolated from blood samples of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice revealed a strong correlation between Atg5 expression and clinical disability. Analysis of protein extracted from these cells confirmed both upregulation and post-translational modification of Atg5, the latter of which was positively correlated with EAE severity. Analysis of RNA extracted from T cells isolated by negative selection indicated that Atg5 expression was significantly elevated in individuals with active relapsing-remitting MS compared to non-diseased controls. Brain tissue sections from relapsing-remitting MS cases examined by immunofluorescent histochemistry suggested that encephalitogenic T cells are a source of Atg5 expression in MS brain samples. Together these data suggest that increased T cell expression of Atg5 may contribute to inflammatory demyelination in MS. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter we discuss methods to study autophagic cell death. A large body of evidence demonstrates that autophagy is a cell survival mechanism in response to starvation. The role of autophagy in cell death, however, has long been controversial. Recently, molecular approaches have provided direct evidence that autophagy contributes to cell death in certain contexts. We begin this chapter by outlining methods to quantify cell death, for example by assaying for cell viability. Next, we discuss methods to measure processes involved in cell death, such as caspase activation and autophagy. Finally, we discuss methods to genetically or chemically perturb autophagy to test whether autophagy is required for cell death. Together, these approaches provide a guide to investigate the relationship between autophagy and cell death. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Dietary compounds can influence the risk of cancer and other diseases through diverse mechanisms which include the activation or inhibition of macroautophagy. Macroautophagy is a catabolic process for the lysosomal degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic constituents which has been implicated in several pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration. In some instances, macroautophagy acts to suppress tumor formation and neural degeneration. Thus, it may be feasible to design diets, supplements or therapeutics that can alter the level of macroautophagy within cells to prevent or treat disease. While critical questions still need to be answered before we can safely and effectively implement such a strategy, we provide here a review of the literature regarding dietary constituents that have a demonstrated macroautophagy-modulating function. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a reparative, life-sustaining process by which cytoplasmic components are sequestered in double-membrane vesicles and degraded on fusion with lysosomal compartments. A growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy is stimulated in advanced atherosclerotic plaques by oxidized lipids, inflammation, and metabolic stress conditions. However, despite the increasing interest in autophagy in various pathophysiological situations such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiac myopathies, the process remains an underestimated and overlooked phenomenon in atherosclerosis. As a consequence, its role in plaque formation and stability is poorly understood. Most likely, autophagy safeguards plaque cells against cellular distress, in particular oxidative injury, by degrading damaged intracellular material. In this way, autophagy is antiapoptotic and contributes to cellular recovery in an adverse environment. An interesting observation is that basal autophagy can be intensified by specific drugs. Excessively stimulated autophagic activity is capable of destroying major proportions of the cytosol, leading finally to type II programmed cell death that lacks several hallmarks of apoptosis or necrosis. Because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder of the arterial intima, pharmacological approaches could be developed to stabilize vulnerable, rupture-prone lesions through selective induction of macrophage autophagic death. © 2009 American Heart Association.

ABSTRACT: The heart is a highly plastic organ capable of remodeling in response to changes in physiological or pathological demand. When workload increases, the heart compensates through hypertrophic growth of individual cardiomyocytes to increase cardiac output. However, sustained stress, such as occurs with hypertension or following myocardial infarction, triggers changes in sarcomeric protein composition and energy metabolism, loss of cardiomyocytes, ventricular dilation, reduced pump function, and ultimately heart failure. It has been known for some time that autophagy is active in cardiomyocytes, occurring at increased levels in disease. Yet the potential contribution of cardiomyocyte autophagy to ventricular remodeling and disease pathogenesis has only recently been explored. This latter fact stems largely from the recent emergence of tools to probe molecular mechanisms governing cardiac plasticity and to define the role of autophagic flux in the context of heart disease. In this chapter, we briefly review prominent mouse models useful in the study of load-induced heart disease and standard techniques used to assess whether a molecular or cellular event is adaptive or maladaptive. We then outline methods available for monitoring autophagic activity in the heart, providing detailed protocols for several techniques unique to working with heart and other striated muscles. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a survival mechanism activated in response to metabolic stress. In normal tissues autophagy plays a major role in energy homeostasis through catabolic self-digestion of damaged proteins and organelles. Contrary to its survival function, autophagy defects are implicated in tumorigenesis suggesting that autophagy is a tumor suppression mechanism. Although the exact mechanism of this tumor suppressor function is not known, it likely involves mitigation of cellular damage leading to chromosomal instability. The complex role of functional autophagy in tumors calls for model systems that allow the assessment of autophagy status, stress management and the impact on oncogenesis both in vitro as well as in vivo. We developed model systems that involve generation of genetically defined, isogenic and immortal epithelial cells from different tissue types that are applicable to both wild-type and mutant mice. This permits the study of tissue- as well as gene-specific tumor promoting functions. We successfully employed this strategy to generate isogenic, immortal epithelial cell lines from wild-type and mutant mice deficient in essential autophagy genes such as beclin 1 (beclin 1<sup>+/-</sup>) and atg5 (atg 5<sup>-/-</sup>). As these cell lines are amenable to further genetic manipulation, they allowed us to generate cell lines with apoptosis defects and stable expression of the autophagy marker EGFP-LC3 that facilitate in vitro and in vivo assessment of stress-mediated autophagy induction. We applied this model system to directly monitor autophagy in cells and 3D-morphogenesis in vitro as well as in tumor allografts in vivo. Using this model system we demonstrated that autophagy is a survival response in solid tumors that co-localizes with hypoxic regions, allowing tolerance to metabolic stress. Furthermore, our studies have established that autophagy also protects tumor cells from genome damage and limits cell death and inflammation as possible means to tumor suppression. Additionally these cell lines provide an efficient way to perform biochemical analyses, and high throughput screening for modulators of autophagy for potential use in cancer therapy and prevention. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a catabolic process involved in cell death and in cell protective mechanism. Autophagic cell death is differentiated from apoptosis by the presence of double or multiple-membrane enclosed vesicles, and the ATG proteins are essential for the formation of these autophagic vesicles. Here, we show that ATG6/Beclin-1 is a novel caspase substrate. ATG6 is directly cleaved by caspases in a process inhibited by the pan caspase inhibitor, zVAD. Ectopic expression of ATG6 suppresses cell death while reduction of ATG6 levels by siRNA sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. Also, the inhibition of caspases leads to an increase in autophagy. These results suggest that caspase-mediated cleavage of ATG6 links the apoptotic and autophagic signaling pathways. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved intracellular process whereby cells break down long-lived proteins and organelles. Accumulating evidences suggest increasing physiological significance of autophagy in pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) exerts its influence on numerous cells and herein, we report a novel effect of LT-induced autophagy on mammalian cells. Several autophagy biochemical markers including LC3-II conversion, increased punctuate distribution of GFP-LC3 and development of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) were detected in cells treated with LT. Analysis of individual LT component revealed a moderate increase in LC3-II conversion for protective antigen-treated cells, whereas the LC3-II level in lethal factor-treated cells remained unchanged. In addition, our preliminary findings suggest a protective role of autophagy in LT intoxication as autophagy inhibition resulted in accelerated cell death. This study presents a hitherto undescribed effect of LT-induced autophagy on cells and provides the groundwork for future studies on the implication of autophagy in anthrax pathogenesis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy is a three-step process: (1) autophagosomes form and mature, (2) the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and (3) the autophagic cargo is degraded in the lysosomes. It is this lysosomal degradation of the autophagic cargo that constitutes the autophagic flux. As in the case of metabolic pathways, the steady-state concentration of the intermediary autophagic structures alone is insufficient for investigating the flux. Assaying the degradation of long-lived proteins as described in this chapter is one of the methods that can be used to measure autophagic flux. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter we describe the use of monodasylcadaverine (MDC) and DQ-BSA, two practical and convenient tools to study the autophagic pathway. MDC is a lysosomotropic compound useful for the identification of autophagic vesicles by fluorescence microscopy and, in addition, to assess autophagy induction via the accumulation of MDC-labeled vacuoles. However, the increase of autophagosomes does not necessarily reflect autophagosome maturation and degradation of the sequestered materials, thus the use of DQ-BSA in conjunction with and autophagic marker is an appropriate technique to monitor the formation of the autolysosome, the degradative compartment. Therefore, here we discuss the advantages of the utilization of these two methods to characterize the autophagy pathway. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, ARF has recently been shown to localize to mitochondria, and to induce autophagy; however, this has never before been demonstrated for endogenous ARF, and the molecular basis for this activity of ARF has not been elucidated. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry-based approach, we show that mitochondrial ARF interacts with the Bcl2 family member Bcl-xl, which normally protects cells from autophagy by inhibiting the Beclin-1/Vps34 complex, which is essential for autophagy. We find that increased expression of ARF decreases Beclin-1/Bcl-xl complexes in cells, thereby providing a basis for ARF-induced autophagy. Our data also indicate that silencing p53 leads to high levels of ARF and increased autophagy, thereby providing a possible basis for the finding by others that p53 inhibits autophagy. The combined data support the premise that ARF induces autophagy in a p53-independent manner in part by virtue of its interaction with Bcl-xl. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved vacuolar, self-digesting mechanism for cellular components, which end up in the lysosomal compartment. In mammalian cells, macroautophagy is cytoprotective, and protects the cells against the accumulation of damaged organelles or protein aggregates, the loss of interaction with the extracellular matrix, and the toxicity of cancer therapies. During periods of nutrient starvation, stimulating macroautophagy provides the fuel required to maintain an active metabolism and the production of ATP. Macroautophagy can inhibit the induction of several forms of cell death, such as apoptosis and necrosis. However, it can also be part of the cascades of events that lead to cell death, either by collaborating with other cell death mechanisms or by causing cell death on its own. Loss of the regulation of bulk macroautophagy can prime self-destruction by cells, and some forms of selective autophagy and non-canonical forms of macroautophagy have been shown to be associated with cell demise. There is now mounting evidence that autophagy and apoptosis share several common regulatory elements that are crucial in any attempt to understand the dual role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death.

ABSTRACT: The role of autophagy, a catabolic lysosome-dependent pathway, has recently been recognized in a variety of disorders, including Pompe disease, which results from a deficiency of the glycogen-degrading lysosomal hydrolase acid-alpha glucosidase (GAA). Skeletal and cardiac muscle are most severely affected by the progressive expansion of glycogen-filled lysosomes. In both humans and an animal model of the disease (GAA KO), skeletal muscle pathology also involves massive accumulation of autophagic vesicles and autophagic buildup in the core of myofibers, suggesting an induction of autophagy. Only when we suppressed autophagy in the skeletal muscle of the GAA KO mice did we realize that the excess of autophagy manifests as a functional deficiency. This failure of productive autophagy is responsible for the accumulation of potentially toxic aggregate-prone ubiquitinated proteins, which likely cause profound muscle damage in Pompe mice. Also, by generating muscle-specific autophagy-deficient wild-type mice, we were able to analyze the role of autophagy in healthy skeletal muscle. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a homeostatic process that enables eukaryotic cells to deliver cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation, to recycle nutrients and to survive during starvation. In addition to these primordial functions, autophagy has emerged as a key mechanism in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Autophagy restricts viral infections as well as replication of intracellular bacteria and parasites and delivers pathogenic determinants for TLR stimulation and for MHC class II presentation to the adaptive immune system. Apart from its role in defense against pathogens, autophagy-mediated presentation of self-antigens in the steady state could have a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell tolerance. This review describes the mechanisms by which the immune system utilizes autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic material to regulate adaptive immune responses.

ABSTRACT: Plants employ sophisticated mechanisms to recycle intracellular constituents needed for growth, development, and survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. Autophagy is one important route in which cytoplasm and organelles are sequestered in bulk into vesicles and subsequently delivered to the vacuole for breakdown by resident hydrolases. The formation and trafficking of autophagic vesicles are directed in part by associated conjugation cascades that couple the AUTOPHAGY-RELATED8 (ATG8) and ATG12 proteins to their respective targets, phosphatidylethanolamine and the ATG5 protein. To help understand the importance of autophagy to nutrient remobilization in cereals, we describe here the ATG8/12 conjugation cascades in maize (Zea mays) and examine their dynamics during development, leaf senescence, and nitrogen and fixed-carbon starvation. From searches of the maize genomic sequence using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) counterparts as queries, we identified orthologous loci encoding all components necessary for ATG8/12 conjugation, including a five-member gene family expressing ATG8. Alternative splicing was evident for almost all Atg transcripts, which could have important regulatory consequences. In addition to free ATG8, its membrane-associated, lipidated form was detected in many maize tissues, suggesting that its conjugation cascade is active throughout the plant at most, if not all, developmental stages. Levels of Atg transcripts and/or the ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine adduct increase during leaf senescence and nitrogen and fixed-carbon limitations, indicating that autophagy plays a key role in nutrient remobilization. The description of the maize ATG system now provides a battery of molecular and biochemical tools to study autophagy in this crop under field conditions. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy, a conserved pathway for bulk cellular degradation and recycling in eukaryotes, regulates proper turnover of organelles, membranes and certain proteins. Such regulated degradation is important for cell growth and development, particularly during environmental stress conditions, which act as key inducers of autophagy. We found that autophagy and MoATG8 were significantly induced during asexual development in Magnaporthe oryzae. An RFP-tagged MoAtg8 showed specific localization and enrichment in aerial hyphae, conidiophores and conidia. We confirmed that loss of MoATG8 results in dramatically reduced ability to form conidia, the asexual spores that propagate rice-blast disease. Exogenous supply of glucose or sucrose significantly suppressed the conidiation defects in a MoATG8-deletion mutant. Comparative proteomics-based identification and characterization of Gph1, a glycogen phosphorylase that catalyzes glycogen breakdown, indicated that autophagy-assisted glycogen homeostasis is likely important for proper aerial growth and conidiation in Magnaporthe. Loss of Gph1, or addition of G6P, significantly restored conidiation in the Moatg8Δ mutant. Overproduction of Gph1 led to reduced conidiation in wild-type Magnaporthe strain. We propose that glycogen autophagy actively responds to and regulates carbon utilization required for cell growth and differentiation during asexual development in Magnaporthe. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic program for degrading proteins and organelles, is essential for cell and tissue homeostasis. Primarily, this process has a cytoprotective role under nutrient deprivation, but several stress stimuli can induce autophagy and, thus, distinct programmed cell death (PCD) pathways can be actived when stress is not abolished. Fish ovaries are a suitable experimental model system for studying the mechanisms of PCD due to the presence of postovulatory and atretic (i.e., nonovulated) follicles, which follow different routes after spawning. Apoptosis of the follicular cells is the major mechanism responsible for the rapid resorption of the postovulatory follicles. Recently, we investigated the contribution of PCD during follicular atresia in two species of freshwater fish. In contrast to mammals, this study revealed that follicular apoptosis is not a major process for deletion of follicular cells in atretic follicles. Furthermore, we detected autophagic vacuoles containing degenerating organelles increasing through follicular atresia in both species. In this addendum, we propose a hypothesis for follicular cell removal during ovarian regression in oviparous fish. In this model, autophagy could have dual roles in follicular atresia. Thus, fish ovaries after breeding are suitable models for studying the interactions among the different cell death pathways. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is mediated primarily by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. Turnover of protein aggregates and other cytoplasmic components, including organelles, is another function attributed to autophagy. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy are essential for normal cell function but under certain pathological conditions can be overwhelmed, which can lead to adverse effects in cells. In this review we will focus primarily on the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cell. Pancreatic β-cells respond to glucose levels by both producing and secreting insulin. The inability of β-cells to secrete sufficient insulin is a major contributory factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this review is to examine some of the crucial roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in normal pancreatic β-cell function and how these pathways may become dysfunctional under pathological conditions associated with metabolic syndromes.

ABSTRACT: The lysosomal pathway digests material received by two main routes, phagocytosis and autophagy. Cells use phagocytosis to ingest extracellular particles by invaginations of the plasma membrane. In autophagy, a double membrane structure isolates portions of the cytoplasm to target it for degradation. During infection, phagocytes use both of these cellular functions to restrict microbial replication and at the same time to orchestrate an appropriate response against the invader. Toll-like receptor recognition of a pathogen initiates an innate immune response against the pathogen that includes production of inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of costimulatory molecules to prime an adaptive immune response, and activation of phagocytosis and autophagy. Signaling through this family of receptors also produces a hybrid response in which proteins that participate in autophagy are recruited to phagosomes, resulting in expedited microbial elimination. In this review, we discuss recent views on how Toll-like receptors direct microbes to final destruction by regulating the different pathways that lead to the lysosome. © 2009 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradative pathway that regulates the turnover of intracellular organelles, parasites, and long-lived proteins. Deregulation of autophagy results in a variety of pathological conditions, but little is known regarding the mechanisms that link normal cellular and pathological signals to the regulation of distinct stages in the autophagy pathway. Here we uncover a novel role for the Abl family kinases in the regulation of the late stages of autophagy. Inhibition, depletion, or knockout of of the Abl family kinases, Abl and Arg, resulted in a dramatic reduction in the intracellular activities of the lysosomal glycosidases α- galactosidase, α-mannosidase and neuraminidase. Inhibition of Abl kinases also reduced the processing of the precursor forms of cathepsin D and cathepsin L to their mature, lysosomal forms, which coincided with the impaired turnover of long-lived cytosolic proteins and accumulation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, defective lysosomal degradation of long-lived proteins in the absence of Abl kinase signaling was accompanied by a perinuclear redistribution of lysosomes and increased glycosylation and stability of lysosome-associated membrane proteins, which are known to be substrates for lysosomal enzymes and play a role in regulating lysosome mobility. Our findings reveal a role for Abl kinases in the regulation of late-stage autophagy and have important implications for therapies that employ pharmacological inhibitors of the Abl kinases. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Breast cancer remains the major cause of cancer-related deaths in women world-wide. The heterogeneity of breast cancer has further complicated the progress of target-based therapies. Triple negative breast cancers, lacking estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and the Her-2/neu (ErbB2), represent a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype, that are difficult to treat. Pleiotropic agents, such as those found in nature, can target receptor-positive as well as receptor-negative cancer cells, suggesting that such agents could have significant impact in breast cancer prevention and/or therapy. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) is one such agent which has anti-tumor activity against several cancers. However, its mechanism of action against breast cancer is not clearly understood. We hypothesized that plumbagin may act as an effective agent against breast cancer especially triple negative breast cancer. We tested our hypothesis using ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) breast cancer cells, and we found that plumbagin significantly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells with no effect on normal breast epithelial cells. We also found that plumbagin induces apoptosis with concomitant inactivation of Bcl-2 and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Bcl-2 over-expression resulted in attenuation of plumbagin-induced effects, suggesting that the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by plumbagin is in part due to inactivation of NF-κB/Bcl-2 pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report, showing mechanistic and cancer cell specific apoptosis-inducing effects of plumbagin in breast cancer cells, suggesting the potential role of plumbagin in the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The role of autophagy, a catabolic lysosome-dependent pathway, has recently been recognized in a variety of disorders, including Pompe disease, the genetic deficiency of the glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme acid-alpha glucosidase. Accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, presumably transported from the cytoplasm by the autophagic pathway, occurs in multiple tissues, but pathology is most severe in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle pathology also involves massive autophagic buildup in the core of myofibers. To determine if glycogen reaches the lysosome via autophagy and to ascertain whether autophagic buildup in Pompe disease is a consequence of induction of autophagy and/ or reduced turnover due to defective fusion with lysosomes, we generated muscle-specific autophagy-deficient Pompe mice. We have demonstrated that autophagy is not required for glycogen transport to lysosomes in skeletal muscle. We have also found that Pompe disease involves induction of autophagy but manifests as a functional deficiency of autophagy because of impaired autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion. As a result, autophagic substrates, including potentially toxic aggregate-prone ubiquitinated proteins, accumulate in Pompe myofibers and may cause profound muscle damage.

ABSTRACT: The heart is a highly plastic organ capable of remodeling in response to changes in physiological or pathological demand. For example, when workload increases, compensatory hypertrophic growth of individual cardiomyocytes occurs to increase cardiac output. Sustained stress, however, such as that occurring with hypertension or following myocardial infarction, triggers changes in energy metabolism and sarcomeric protein composition, loss of cardiomyocytes, ventricular dilation, reduced pump function, and ultimately heart failure. It has been known for some time that autophagy is active in cardiomyocytes, occurring at increased levels in disease. Now, with recent advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms governing autophagy, the potential contributions of cardiomyocyte autophagy to ventricular remodeling and disease pathogenesis are being explored. As part of this work, several recent studies have focused on autophagy in heart disease elicited by changes in hemodynamic load. Pressure overload stress elicits a robust autophagic response in cardiomyocytes that is maladaptive, contributing to disease progression. In this context, load-induced aggregation of intracellular proteins is a proximal event triggering autophagic clearance mechanisms. These findings in the setting of pressure overload contrast with protein aggregation occurring in a model of protein chaperone malfunction, where activation of autophagy is beneficial, antagonizing disease progression. Here, we review recent studies of cardiomyocyte autophagy in load-induced disease and address molecular mechanisms and unanswered questions. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy was induced in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by two different procedures: deprivation of fetal serum in culture medium, or treatment with dopamine. 3-methyladenine prevented autophagy in the two procedures. Although it is usually considered that the conversion of soluble LC3-I to lipid bound LC3-II is associated with the formation of autophagosomes, the inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine prevented this transformation in serum-deprived but not in dopamine-treated cells. While the PI3K-mTOR pathway was inhibited by serum deprivation, dopamine increased the phosphorylation of Akt but inhibited mTOR activity in a similar way to rapamycin. Dopamine and rapamycin increased LC3-II levels by a mechanism not prevented by 3-methyladenine. The activation of LC3-I to LC3-II may then be necessary but not sufficient to trigger cell autophagy. Thus, the increase in LC3-II, as the main biochemical parameter for autophagy at present, should be considered with caution.

ABSTRACT: Apoptosis of neutrophils controls the duration and the intensity of an inflammatory response and therefore the extent of neutrophil- mediated tissue damage, disturbance of neutrophil apoptosis has been associated with many diseases, underlying mechanism is not elucidated. C5a is a complement fragment that has multifunctional properties, which induces neutrophil chemoattraction, an oxidative burst, enhancement of phagocytosis, release of granule enzymes, and suppress neutrophil apoptosis. Several studies have reported calpain is involved in both neutrophil functions and apoptosis and it might play a more specific role in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis. Diffenrent isoform of calpains is activted by diffenrent stimuli through different transduction pathway. It was reported previously that calpain is required for neutrophil migration and Chemotaxis induced by C5a. In addition, autophagy is a ubiquitous physiological process that occurs in all eukaryotic cells and is considered to be a survival mechanism. Atg5 promotes autophagy and is indispensable to autophagosome formation. Upon calpain activation, Atg5 is cleaved and the resulting 24 ku Atg5 mediates apoptosis while losting the property of autophagy. Therefore, Atg5 represents a molecular switch between autophagy and apoptosis. The interaction among the C5a, calpain and Atg5 was introduced and new direction for further research was provided.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway for cytoplasmic material. Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is related closely to the occurrence and development of tumor. Beclin 1 was the first identified mammalian gene with a role in mediating autophagy. More and more evidence indicates beclin 1 has a causative role for autophagy deficiencies in cancer formation. Here, we review the present conditions of autophagy, beclin 1, and their correlation with the occurrence and development of cancer.

ABSTRACT: Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) regulates multiple membrane trafficking. In yeast, two distinct PI3-kinase complexes are known: complex I (Vps34, Vps15, Vps30/Atg6, and Atg14) is involved in autophagy, and complex II (Vps34, Vps15, Vps30/Atg6, and Vps38) functions in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. Atg14 and Vps38 are important in inducing both complexes to exert distinct functions. In mammals, the counterparts of Vps34, Vps15, and Vps30/Atg6 have been identified as Vps34, p150, and Beclin 1, respectively. However, orthologues of Atg14 and Vps38 remain unknown. We identified putative mammalian homologues of Atg14 and Vps38. The Vps38 candidate is identical to UV irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), which has been reported as a Beclin 1-interacting protein. Although both human Atg14 and UVRAG interact with Beclin 1 and Vps34, Atg14, and UVRAG are not present in the same complex. Although Atg14 is present on autophagic isolation membranes, UVRAG primarily associates with Rab9-positive endosomes. Silencing of human Atg14 in HeLa cells suppresses autophagosome formation. The coiled-coil region of Atg14 required for binding with Vps34 and Beclin 1 is essential for autophagy. These results suggest that mammalian cells have at least two distinct class III PI3-kinase complexes, which may function in different membrane trafficking pathways. © 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

ABSTRACT: The ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is emerging as a common downstream target of signalling by hormones and nutrients such as insulin and amino acids. Here, we have investigated how amino acids signal through the S6K1 pathway. First, we found that a commercial anti-phospho-Thr389-S6K1 antibody detects an 80-90 kDa protein that is rapidly phosphorylated in response to amino acids. Unexpectedly, this phosphorylation was insensitive to both mTOR and PI-3 kinase inhibitors, and knockdown experiments showed that this protein was not S6K1. Looking for candidate targets of this phosphorylation, we found that amino acids stimulated phosphorylation of RSK and MSK kinases at residues that are homologous to Thr389 in S6K1. In turn, these phosphorylations required the activity of either p38 or ERK MAP kinases, which could compensate for each other. Moreover, we show that these MAP kinases are also needed for the amino acid-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr421/Ser424, as well as for that of S6K1 substrate, the S6 ribosomal protein. Consistent with these results, concomitant inhibition of p38 and ERK pathways also antagonised the well-known effects of amino acids on the process of autophagy. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a previously unknown role for MAP kinases in amino acid signalling. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Disruption of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel results in the neurodegenerative disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a lysosomal storage disease with severe motor impairments. The mechanisms underlying MLIV are poorly understood and there is no treatment. Here, we report a Drosophila MLIV model, which recapitulates the key disease features, including abnormal intracellular accumulation of macromolecules, motor defects, and neurodegeneration. The basis for the buildup of macromolecules was defective autophagy, which resulted in oxidative stress and impaired synaptic transmission. Late-apoptotic cells accumulated in trpml mutant brains, suggesting diminished cell clearance. The accumulation of late-apoptotic cells and motor deficits were suppressed by expression of trpml<sup>+</sup> in neurons, glia, or hematopoietic cells. We conclude that the neurodegeneration and motor defects result primarily from decreased clearance of apoptotic cells. Since hematopoietic cells in humans are involved in clearance of apoptotic cells, our results raise the possibility that bone marrow transplantation may limit the progression of MLIV. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The regulation of mitochondrial degradation through autophagy is expected to be a tightly controlled process, considering the significant role of this organelle in many processes ranging from energy production to cell death. However, very little is known about the specific nature of the degradation process. We developed a new method to detect mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) by fusing the green fluorescent protein at the C terminus of two endogenous mitochondrial proteins and monitored vacuolar release of green fluorescent protein. Using this method, we screened several atg mutants and found that ATG11, a gene that is essential only for selective autophagy, is also essential for mitophagy. In addition, we found that mitophagy is blocked even under severe starvation conditions, if the carbon source makes mitochondria essential for metabolism. These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles are largely protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy presents a topological challenge for the cell because it requires delivery of cytosolic material to the lumen of a membrane-bound compartment, the lysosome. This is solved in an ingenious way by the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome, which captures cytosolic proteins and organelles during its transformation from a planar membrane disk into a sphere. In this way, cytosolic material first becomes lumenal and is then delivered for degradation to the lysosome. An unsolved set of questions in autophagy concerns the membrane of the autophagosome: what are the signals for its formation and what is its identity? Recently we provided some clues that may help answer these questions.<sup>1</sup> By following the dynamics of several phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding proteins during amino acid starvation (and autophagy induction) we concluded that at least some autophagosomes are formed in a starvation-induced, PI3P-enriched membrane compartment dynamically connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We termed the membranes of this compartment omegasomes (from their omega-like shape). Our data suggest that PI3P is important for providing localization clues and perhaps for facilitating the fusion step at the final stage of autophagosome formation. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Adaptation to hypoxia through activation of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is crucial for tumor cells survival. Here we describe the antitumoral effects of the new molecule CR 3294 on tumor cells in the presence of hypoxia. Treatment of the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 with CR 3294 in 1% O <sub>2</sub> resulted in an in vivo and in vitro inhibition of tumor growth. CR 3294 induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells as assessed by both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the autophagic marker LC3-II. TEM analysis revealed the presence of invaginations of the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Autophagosomes were present in such invaginations. Moreover, CR 3294 inhibited both the DNA binding of HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA synthesis. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed an interaction between LC3 and HIF-1α. We next detailed the effect of inhibitors and activators of autophagy on both HIF-1α and LC3. In particular, 3 methyladenine (3MA) and wortmannin, two macroautophagic inhibitors, prevented both the decrease of HIF-1α protein levels and LC3 processing in cells treated with CR 3294. Bafilomycin and leupeptin, inhibitors of lysosomes, prevented HIF-1α decrease without affecting LC3 processing. By contrast, treating hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells with trifluoperazine (TFP) or serum withdrawal (SW), two activators of autophagy, diminished HIF-1α levels and stimulated LC3 processing. These results indicate that activation of the autophagic pathway in hypoxic cells by the new molecule CR 3294, as well as by TFP or SW, can have potentially important implications for cancer treatment. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic mechanism whereby cells recycle cellular elements to survive under adverse conditions. Surprisingly, of the three fungal pathogens of greatest relevance to human health, only Cryptococcus neoformans has been shown to require this process during infection. In contrast, autophagy is dispensable for the virulence of both Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The divergent roles for autophagy in these opportunistic species underscore the uniqueness of the host infection niche occupied by each fungus and provide insights into the evolutionary pressures that may have influenced the need for autophagy during infection. Further study of fungal autophagy may reveal the host signals which induce this protective response and determine if these signals differ between host cells or tissues. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of the autophagy machinery in fungal pathogens may provide a rational basis for the design of future therapeutic interventions to improve outcome in patients who are at risk for these infections. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: In our previous studies, the bisindolic alkaloid voacamine (VOA), isolated from the plant Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, proved to exert a chemosensitizing effect on cultured multidrug resistant (MDR) osteosarcoma cells exposed to doxorubicin (DOX). In particular, VOA was capable of inhibiting P-glycoprotein action in a competitive way, thus explaining the enhancement of the cytotoxic effect induced by DOX on MDR cells. Afterwards, preliminary observations suggested that such an enhancement did not involve the apoptotic process but was due instead to the induction of autophagic cell death. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that the plant alkaloid VOA is an autophagy inducer able to exert apoptosis-independent cytotoxic effect on both wild-type and MDR tumor cells. In fact, under treatment condition causing about 50 percent of cell death, no evidence of apoptosis could be revealed by microscopical observations, Annexin V-FITC labeling and analysis of PARP cleavage, whereas the same cells underwent apoptosis when treated with apoptosis inducers, such as doxorubicin and staurosporine. Conversely, VOA-induced autophagy was clearly evidentiated by electron microscopy observations, monodansylcadaverine staining, LC3 expression, and conversion. These results were confirmed by the analysis of the modulating effects of the pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors prior to VOA administration. In addition, transfection of osteosarcoma cells with siRNA against ATG genes reduced VOA cytotoxicity. In conclusion, considering the very debated dual role of autophagy in cancer cells (protective or lethal, pro- or anti-apoptotic) our findings seem to demonstrate, at least in vitro, that a natural product able to induce autophagy can be effective against drug resistant tumors, either used alone or in association with conventional chemotherapeutics. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: The lysosomal compartment consists of numerous acidic vesicles (pH ~ 4-5) that constantly fuse and divide. It receives a large number of hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network, while their substrates arrive from both the cell's outside (heterophagy) and inside (autophagy). Many macromolecules under degradation inside lysosomes contain iron that, when released in labile form, makes lysosomes sensitive to oxidative stress. The magnitude of generated lysosomal destabilization determines if reparative autophagy, apoptosis, or necrosis will follow. Apart from being an essential turnover process, autophagy is also a mechanism for cells to repair inflicted damage, and to survive temporary starvation. The inevitable diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into iron-rich lysosomes causes the slow oxidative formation of lipofuscin in long-lived postmitotic cells, where it finally occupies a substantial part of the volume of the lysosomal compartment. This seems to result in a misdirection of lysosomal enzymes away from autophagosomes, resulting in depressed autophagy and the accumulation of malfunctioning mitochondria and proteins with consequent cellular dysfunction. This scenario might put aging into the category of autophagy disorders. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) constitutes one of the major checkpoint(s) of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Recently, the permeabilization of yet another organelle, the lysosome, has been shown to initiate a cell death pathway, in specific circumstances. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) causes the release of cathepsins and other hydrolases from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. LMP is induced by a plethora of distinct stimuli including reactive oxygen species, lysosomotropic compounds with detergent activity, as well as some endogenous cell death effectors such as Bax. LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D), which then induces MOMP, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation. However, massive LMP often results in cell death without caspase activation; this cell death may adopt a subapoptotic or necrotic appearance. The regulation of LMP is perturbed in cancer cells, suggesting that specific strategies for LMP induction might lead to novel therapeutic avenues. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Eukaryotic cells can synthesize the non-essential amino acid arginine from aspartate and citrulline using the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). It has been observed that ASS is underexpressed in various types of cancers ASS, for which arginine become auxotrophic. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is a prokaryotic enzyme that metabolizes arginine to citrulline and has been found to inhibit melanoma and hepatoma cancer cells deficient of ASS. We tested the hypothesis that pancreatic cancers have low ASS expression and therefore arginine deprivation by ADI will inhibit cell growth. ASS expression was examined in 47 malignant and 20 non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues as well as a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Arginine deprivation was achieved by treatment with a recombinant form of ADI formulated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-ADI). Effects on caspase activation, cell growth and cell death were examined. Furthermore, the effect of PEG-ADI on the in vivo growth of pancreatic xenografts was examined. Eighty-seven percent of the tumors lacked ASS expression; 5 of 7 cell lines similarly lacked ASS expression. PEG-ADI specifically inhibited growth of those cell lines lacking ASS. PEG-ADI treatment induced caspase activation and induction of apoptosis. PEG-ADI was well tolerated in mice despite complete elimination of plasma arginine; tumor growth was inhibited by ∼50%. Reduced expression of ASS occurs in pancreatic cancer and predicts sensitivity to arginine deprivation achieved by PEG-ADI treatment. Therefore, these findings suggest that arginine deprivation by ADI could provide a beneficial strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, a malignancy in which new therapy is desperately needed. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Anthocyanins extracted from the berries of Phillyrea latifolia L., Pistacia lentiscus L., and Rubia peregrina L., three evergreen shrubs widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, were examined for their antioxidant and anticancer activity. The P. lentiscus anthocyanins showed the highest H<sub>2</sub>O <sub>2</sub> and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical scavenging effects, indicating that these compounds can be considered as an alternative source of natural antioxidants for food and pharmaceutical products. Here, we also report a novel function of anthocyanins: the induction of autophagy, a process of subcellular turnover involved in carcinogenesis. Autophagy was characterized by the up-regulation of eIF2α, an autophagy inducer, and down-regulation of mTOR and Bcl-2, two autophagy inhibitors. This led to the enhanced expression of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker in mammals, and monodansyl-cadaverine incorporation into autolysosomes. Anthocyanin-induced autophagy switched to apoptosis, as shown by the activation of Bax, cytochrome c and caspase 3, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive fragmented nuclei, and cells with sub-G<sub>1</sub> DNA content, which were prevented by z-VAD. Inhibition of autophagy by either 3-methyladenine or Atg5 small interfering RNA enhanced anthocyanin-triggered apoptosis. This provided evidence that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism in liver cancer cells against anthocyanin-induced apoptosis and a rationale for the use of autophagy inhibitors in combination with dietary chemopreventive agents.

ABSTRACT: Alix/AIP1 is a cytosolic protein that regulates cell death through mechanisms that remain unclear. Alix binds to two protein members of the so-called Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT), which facilitates membrane fission events during multivesicular endosome formation, enveloped virus budding and cytokinesis. Alix itself has been suggested to participate in these cellular events and is thus often considered to function in the ESCRT pathway. ESCRT proteins were recently implicated in autophagy, a process involved in bulk degradation of cytoplasmic constituents in lysosomes, which can also participate in cell death. In this study, we shown that, unlike ESCRT proteins, Alix is not involved in autophagy. These results strongly suggest that the capacity of several mutants of Alix to block both caspase-dependent and independent cell death does not relate to their capacity to modulate autophagy. Furthermore, they reinforce the conclusion of other studies demonstrating that the role of Alix is different from that of classical ESCRT proteins. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a degradative process playing a role in both cell death and cell survival. Its presence is well conserved both in lower and higher eukaryotes. Recent studies have shown that activation or inhibition of autophagy may be possible in biotechnologically important species including mammalian cells and filamentous fungi using both environmental manipulation and genetic engineering. As our understanding of the autophagic biochemical pathways increases and monitoring methods become more user-friendly, the potential exists to obtain an optimum level of autophagy. This may allow for maximum cell survival and production of proteins and other metabolites in these industrially important eukaryotes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: While autophagy is believed to be beneficial for life-span extension, it is controversial which forms or aspects of autophagy are responsible for this effect. We addressed this topic by analyzing the life span of yeast autophagy mutants under caloric restriction, a longevity manipulation. Surprisingly, we discovered that the majority of proteins involved in macroautophagy and several forms of microautophagy were dispensable for life-span extension. The only autophagy protein that is critical for life-span extension was Atg15, a lipase that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to vacuoles for disintegrating membranes of autophagic bodies. We further found that vacuole-vacuole fusion was required for life-span extension, which was indicated by the shortened life span of mutants missing proteins (ypt7Δ, nyv1Δ, vac8Δ) or lipids (erg6Δ) involved in fusion. Since a known function of vacuole-vacuole fusion is the maintenance of the vacuole membrane integrity, we analyzed aged vacuoles and discovered that aged cells had altered vacuolar morphology and accumulated autophagic bodies, suggesting that certain forms of autophagy do contribute to longevity. Like aged cells, erg6Δ accumulated autophagic bodies, which is likely caused by a defect in lipase instead of proteases due to the existence of multiple vacuolar proteases. Since macroautophagy is not blocked by erg6Δ, we propose that a new form of autophagy transports Atg15 via the fusion of vacuoles with vesicles derived from ER, and we designate this putative form of autophagy as secretophagy. Pending future biochemical studies, the concept of secretophagy may provide a mechanism for autophagy in life-span extension. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Programmed cell death, together with proliferation and differentiation, is an essential process during the development of the nervous system. During neurogenesis, neurons and glia are generated in large numbers and, subsequently, they die in a process that depends on trophic signalling that refines the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the nervous system. in addition, programmed cell death also affects proliferating neuroepithelial cells and recently differentiated neuroblasts. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway that allows the recycling of cell constituents, and seems to be able to play a dual role. It may serve to protect the cell by preventing the accumulation of deleterious products and organelles and supplying energy and amino acids. on the other hand, it has been considered a type of cell death. The role of autophagy during development is little characterized. The retina provides an excellent model system to study autophagy in the context of neural development, and to establish its relationship with proliferation, differentiation and cell death. in the present review, we summarize recent findings showing that autophagy contributes to the development of the nervous system by providing energy for cell corpse removal after physiological cell death, a process associated with retinal neurogenesis. © The Authors Journal Compilation. © 2008 Biochemical Society.

ABSTRACT: The heart is capable of robust structural remodeling, sometimes improving performance and sometimes leading to failure. Recent studies have uncovered a critical role for autophagy in disease-related remodeling of the cardiomyocyte. We have shown previously that hemodynamic load elicits a maladaptive autophagic response in cardiomyocytes which contributes to disease progression. In a recent study, we went on to demonstrate that protein aggregation is a proximal event triggering autophagic clearance mechanisms. The ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathways of protein clearance are similarly activated in parallel with processing of stress-induced protein aggregates into aggresomes and clearance through autophagy. These findings in the setting of pressure overload contrast with protein aggregation occurring in a model of protein chaperone malfunction in myocytes, where activation of autophagy is beneficial, antagonizing disease progression. Our findings situate heart disease stemming from environmental stress in the category of proteinopathy and raise important new questions regarding molecular events that elicit adaptive and maladaptive autophagy. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that controls cell growth by activating an array of anabolic processes including protein synthesis, transcription and ribosome biogenesis, and by inhibiting catabolic processes such as mRNA degradation and autophagy. Control of autophagy by TOR occurs primarily at the induction step, and involves activation of the ATG1 kinase, a conserved component of the autophagic machinery. A substantial number of genes participating in autophagy have been originally identified in yeast. Most of these genes have mammalian homologues and many have apparent homologues in plants, indicating that autophagy is conserved among eukaryotes. The recent identification of TOR as a key element in cell growth control in plants and algae opens the way for future studies to investigate whether this signaling pathway may also control autophagy in photosynthetic organisms. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with unknown etiology. Growing evidence from genetic, pathologic, animal modeling, and biochemical studies strongly support the theory that abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. Protein aggregation is an alternative folding process that competes with the native folding pathway. Whether or not a protein is subject to the aggregation process is determined by the concentration of the protein as well as thermodynamic properties inherent to each polypeptide. An increase in cellular concentration of α-synuclein has been associated with the disease in both familial and sporadic forms of PD. Thus, maintenance of the intraneuronal steady state levels of α-synuclein below the critical concentration is a key challenge neuronal cells are facing. Expression of the α-synuclein gene is under the control of environmental factors and aging, the two best-established risk factors for PD. Studies also suggest that the degradation of this protein is mediated by proteasomal and autophagic pathways, which are two mechanisms that are related to the pathogenesis of PD. Recently, vesicle-mediated exocytosis has been suggested as a novel mechanism for disposal of neuronal α-synuclein. Relocalization of the protein to specific compartments may be another method for increasing its local concentration. Regulation of the neuronal steady state levels of α-synuclein has significant implications in the development of PD, and understanding the mechanism may disclose potential therapeutic targets for PD and other related diseases. © 2008 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A complex relationship exists between autophagy and apoptosis, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying their interactions are largely unknown. We conducted a systematic study of Drosophila melanogaster cell death-related genes to determine their requirement in the regulation of starvation-induced autophagy. We discovered that six cell death genes - death caspase-1 (Dcp-1), hid, Bruce, Buffy, debcl, and p53 - as well as Ras-Raf-mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway components had a role in autophagy regulation in D. melanogaster cultured cells. During D. melanogaster oogenesis, we found that autophagy is induced at two nutrient status checkpoints: germarium and mid-oogenesis. At these two stages, the effector caspase Dcp-1 and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein Bruce function to regulate both autophagy and starvation-induced cell death. Mutations in Atg1 and Atg7 resulted in reduced DNA fragmentation in degenerating midstage egg chambers but did not appear to affect nuclear condensation, which indicates that autophagy contributes in part to cell death in the ovary. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that coordinately regulate autophagic and apoptotic events in vivo. © 2008 Hou et al.

ABSTRACT: Resistance to cell death is a hallmark of cancer. Autophagy is a survival mechanism activated in response to nutrient deprivation; however, excessive autophagy will ultimately induce cell death in a nonapoptotic manner. The present study demonstrates that CCL2 protects prostate cancer PC3 cells from autophagic death, allowing prolonged survival in serum-free conditions. Upon serum starvation, CCL2 induced survivin up-regulation in PC3, DU 145, and C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Both cell survival and survivin expression were stunted in CCL2-stimulated PC3 cells when treated either with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (2 μM) or the Akt-specific inhibitor-X (Akti-X; 2.5 μM). Furthermore, CCL2 significantly reduced light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in serum-starved PC3; in contrast, treatment with LY294002 or Akti-X reversed the effect of CCL2 on LC3-II levels, suggesting that CCL2 signaling limits autophagy in these cells. Upon serum deprivation, the analysis of LC3 localization by immunofluorescence revealed a remarkable reduction in LC3 punctate after CCL2 stimulation. CCL2 treatment also resulted in a higher sustained mTORC1 activity as measured by an increase in phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr<sup>389</sup>). Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, both down-regulated survivin and decreased PC3 cell viability in serum-deprived conditions. Treatment with CCL2, however, allowed cells to partially resist rapamycin-induced death, which correlated with survivin protein levels. In two stable transfectants expressing survivin-specific short hairpin RNA, generated from PC3, survivin protein levels controlled both cell viability and LC3 localization in response to CCL2 treatment. Altogether, these findings indicate that CCL2 protects prostate cancer PC3 cells from autophagic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/survivin pathway and reveal survivin as a critical molecule in this survival mechanism. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cellular process of bulk degradation of damaged organelles, protein aggregates and other macromolecules in the cytoplasm. It is thought to be a general response to stress contributing to cell death; alternatively it might act as a cytoprotective mechanism. Here we found that administration of cisplatin induced the formation of autophagic vesicles and autophagosomes in mouse kidneys. In cultured proximal tubular cells, the nephrotoxin caused autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner prior to apoptosis. Notably, autophagy occurred within hours of cisplatin administration but this was partially suppressed by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α, suggesting that p53 is involved in autophagic signaling. This cisplatin-induced autophagy was attenuated in renal cells stably transfected with Bcl-2, suggesting an anti-autophagic role for this well-known anti-apoptotic protein. Blockade of autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors (3-methyladenine or bafilomycin) or shRNA knockdown of the autophagic gene Beclin increased tubular cell apoptosis during cisplatin treatment. Our study has found that autophagy occurs in acute kidney injury and this may be an important protective mechanism for cell survival. © 2008 International Society of Nephrology.

ABSTRACT: Cell cycle arrest in G<sub>0</sub> and autophagy have features in common, but the inter-relationship between the two processes is not well defined. The anti-apoptosis molecules BCL-2 and BCL-x<sub>L</sub> promote G<sub>0</sub> arrest through upregulation of p27 protein, which can also induce autophagy. We tested the hypothesis that autophagy was involved in the cell cycle arrest function of BCL-2 and BCL-x<sub>L</sub>. We found that in IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells, NIH3T3 cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts induced to arrest, treatment with 3-methyladenine did not affect the expected decrease in cell size and ribosomal RNA synthesis, or upregulation of p27 levels. Using the m5-7 ATG5 <sup>-/-</sup> MEF cell line with doxycycline-regulated ATG5 expression, we demonstrated that autophagy was activated during serum withdrawal and contact inhibition, but inhibition of autophagy had no measurable effect on G <sub>0</sub> arrest in parental or BCL-x<sub>L</sub>-expressing cells. Thus, our data indicate that, in cell culture models, autophagy occurs but is not required for entrance into quiescence or for the G<sub>0</sub> function of BCL-2 or BCL-x<sub>L</sub>. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies suggest a possible takeover of host antimicrobial autophagy machinery by positive-stranded RNA viruses to facilitate their own replication. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy in coxsackievirus replication. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a picornavirus associated with viral myocarditis, causes pronounced intracellular membrane reorganization after infection. We demonstrate that CVB3 infection induces an increased number of double-membrane vesicles, accompanied by an increase of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and an accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3-expressing cells, two hallmarks of cellular autophagosome formation. However, protein expression analysis of p62, a marker for autophagy-mediated protein degradation, showed no apparent changes after CVB3 infection. These results suggest that CVB3 infection triggers autophagosome formation without promoting protein degradation by the lysosome. We further examined the role of the autophagosome in CVB3 replication. We demonstrated that inhibition of autophagosome formation by 3-methyladenine or small interfering RNAs targeting the genes critical for autophagosome formation (ATG7, Beclin-1, and VPS34 genes) significantly reduced viral replication. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or nutrient deprivation resulted in increased viral replication. Finally, we examined the role of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in viral replication. We showed that blockage of the fusion by gene silencing of the lysosomal protein LAMP2 significantly promoted viral replication. Taken together, our results suggest that the host's autophagy machinery is activated during CVB3 infection to enhance the efficiency of viral replication.

ABSTRACT: The mitochondrial life cycle consists of frequent fusion and fission events. Ample experimental and clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of either fusion or fission results in deterioration of mitochondrial bioenergetics. While fusion may benefit mitochondrial function by allowing the spreading of metabolites, protein and DNA throughout the network, the functional benefit of fission is not as intuitive. Remarkably, studies that track individual mitochondria through fusion and fission found that the two events are paired and that fusion triggers fission. On average each mitochondrion would go though ~ 5 fusion:fission cycles every hour. Measurement of Δψ<sub>m</sub> during single fusion and fission events demonstrates that fission may yield uneven daughter mitochondria where the depolarized daughter is less likely to become involved in a subsequent fusion and is more likely to be targeted by autophagy. Based on these observations we propose a mechanism by which the integration of mitochondrial fusion, fission and autophagy forms a quality maintenance mechanism. According to this hypothesis pairs of fusion and fission allow for the reorganization and sequestration of damaged mitochondrial components into daughter mitochondria that are segregated from the networking pool and then becoming eliminated by autophagy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a highly conserved processing mechanism in eukaryotes whereby cytoplasmic components are engulfed in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and are delivered into organelles such as lysosomes (mammal) or vacuoles (yeast/plant) for degradation and recycling of the resulting molecules. Isolation of yeast AUTOPHAGY (ATG) genes has facilitated the identification of corresponding Arabidopsis ATG genes based on sequence similarity. Genetic and molecular analyses using knockout and/or knockdown mutants of those genes have unraveled the biological functions of autophagy during plant development, nutrient recycling, and environmental stress responses. Additional roles for autophagy have been suggested in the degradation of oxidized proteins during oxidative stress and the regulation of hypersensitive response (HR)-programmed cell death (PCD) during innate immunity. Our review summarizes knowledge about the structure and function of autophagic pathways and ATG components, and the biological roles of autophagy in plants.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a major intracellular degradative pathway that is involved in various human diseases. The role of autophagy, however, is complex; although the process is generally considered to be cytoprotective, it can also contribute to cellular dysfunction and disease progression. Much progress has been made in our understanding of autophagy, aided in large part by the identification of the autophagy -related (ATG ) genes. Nonetheless, our understanding of the molecular mechanism remains limited. In this study, we generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae multiple-knockout strain with 24 ATG genes deleted, and we used it to carry out an in vivo reconstitution of the autophagy pathway. We determined minimum requirements for different aspects of autophagy and studied the initial protein assembly steps at the phagophore assembly site. In vivo reconstitution enables the study of autophagy within the context of the complex regulatory networks that control this process, an analysis that is not possible with an in vitro system. © 2008 Cao et al.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy can be activated by a broad range of agents and cellular manipulations. In performing cellular transfection using the calcium phosphate method, we noticed that the calcium phosphate precipitates (CPP) could induce LC3 punctation. Because of the wide use of this transfection method in mammalian cells and the potential significance of calcium in autophagy induction, we investigated whether CPP could specifically induce macroautophagy. We found that CPP-induced LC3 punctation was dependent on calcium and could be neutralized by an extracelluar or intracellular calcium chelator. The punctation was not due to nonspecific aggregation of LC3 since it depended on the amino acid residue Glycine120, which is specifically required for LC3 to conjugate to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Consistently, there was also a significant increase of the PE-conjugated form of LC3. Electron microscopy confirmed the accumulation of typical autophagosomes following CPP treatment. Flux analysis indicated that CPP induced but did not inhibit autophagic degradation. Finally CPP-induced autophagy depended on the classical macroautophagy machinery including Beclin 1, the class III phosphoinositide-3 kinase and Atg5. Our studies thus indicate that exogenously introduced calcium in the form of CPP could specifically induce macroautophagy, which may have the practical significance in the use of this agent for introducing genes into cells, and for studying the mechanism of autophagy as a model system. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cellular process that has been defined and analyzed almost entirely by qualitative measures. In no small part, this is attributable to the absence of robust quantitative assays that can easily and reliably permit the progress of key steps in autophagy to be assessed. We have recendy developed a cell-based assay that specifically measures proteolytic cleavage of a tripartite sensor protein by the autophagy protease ATG4B. Activation of ATG4B results in release of Gaussia luciferase from cells that can be non-invasively harvested from cellular supernatants. Here, we compare this technique to existing methods and propose that this type of assay will be suitable for genome-wide functional screens and in vivo analysis of autophagy. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: As terminally differentiated vital cells, neurons may be specialized to fight viral infections without undergoing cellular self-destruction. The cellular lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is emerging as one such mechanism of neuronal antiviral defence. Autophagy has diverse physiological functions, such as cellular adaptation to stress, routine organelle and protein turnover, and innate immunity against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Most of the in vivo evidence for an antiviral role of autophagy is related to viruses that specifically target neurons, including the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus, and the α-herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In the case of HSV-1, viral evasion of autophagy is essential for lethal encephalitis. As basal autophagy is important in preventing neurodegeneration, and induced autophagy is important in promoting cellular survival during stress, viral antagonism of autophagy in neurons may lead to neuronal dysfunction and/or neuronal cell death. This review provides background information on the roles of autophagy in immunity and neuroprotection, and then discusses the relationships between autophagy and viral neurovirulence. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a unique form of membrane trafficking, which delivers macromolecules and organelles from the cytoplasm to lysosomes for degradation. This fundamental and ubiquitous process in eukaryotic cells is mediated by the double-membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes, which transiently emerge in the cytoplasm. The recent remarkable explosion of knowledge of autophagy has revealed its multiple roles, especially in mammals; in addition to its basic role in turnover and reuse of cellular constituents, the process unexpectedly functions in elimination of invading bacteria and antigen presentation. Analysis of mammalian homologs of the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins identified in yeast has shed light on not only the common molecular mechanisms underlying autophagosome formation, but also specialized mechanisms that are related to the diverse functions and complex regulation of autophagy in higher organisms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a homoeostatic process necessary for the clearance of damaged or superfluous proteins and organelles. The recycling of intracellular constituents also provides energy during periods of metabolic stress, thereby contributing to cell viability. In addition, disruption of autophagic machinery interferes with embryonic development in several species, although the underlying cellular processes affected remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of autophagy during the early stages of chick retina development, when the retinal neuroepithelium proliferates and starts to generate the first neurons, the retinal ganglion cells. These two developmental processes are accompanied by programmed cell death. Upon treatment with the autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine, retinas accumulated numerous TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling-positive cells that correlated with a lack of the 'eat-me' signal phosphatidylserine (PS). In consequence, neighbouring cells did not engulf apoptotic bodies and they persisted as individual cell corpses, a phenotype that was also observed after blockade of phagocytosis with phospho-L-Serine. Supplying the retinas with methylpyruvate, a cell-permeable substrate for ATP production, restored ATP levels and the presentation of PS at the cell surface. Hence, engulfment and lysosomal degradation of apoptotic bodies were also re-established. Together, these data point to a novel role for the autophagic machinery during the development of the central nervous system.

ABSTRACT: The cell biological phenomenon of autophagy (or 'self-eating') has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this review, we first address the cell biological functions of autophagy, and then discuss recent insights into the role of autophagy in animal development, particularly in C. elegans, Drosophila and mouse. Work in these and other model systems has also provided evidence for the involvement of autophagy in disease processes, such as neurodegeneration, tumorigenesis, pathogenic infection and aging. Insights gained from investigating the functions of autophagy in normal development should increase our understanding of its roles in human disease and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy (called autophagy hereafter) is a catabolic process activated by various types of stress, most notably by nutrient deprivation. The autophagic degradation of intracellular macromolecules provides metabolic support for the cell; however, this physiological process can also initiate a form of cell death (type 2 programmed cell death). Here we report that oxygen deprivation can activate the autophagic pathway in human cancer cell lines. We observed that hypoxia induced distinct cellular changes characteristic of autophagy such as an increase in cytoplasmic acidic vesicles, and processing and cellular localization of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3. Oxygen deprivation-induced autophagy did not require nutrient deprivation, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activity, or expression of the HIF-1 target gene BNIP3 (Bcl-2 adenovirus E1a nineteen kilodalton interacting protein 3) or BNIP3L (BNIP3 like protein). Hypoxia-induced autophagy involved the activity of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Finally, we determined that cells lacking the autophagy gene ATG5 were unable to activate the autophagic machinery in hypoxia, had decreased oxygen consumption and increased glucose uptake under hypoxia, had increased survival in hypoxic environments, and exhibited accelerated growth as xenografted tumors. Together, these findings suggest that the autophagic degradation of cellular macromolecules contributes to the energetic balance governed by AMPK, and that suppression of autophagy in transformed cells can increase both resistance to hypoxic stress and tumorigenicity.

ABSTRACT: After fertilization, maternal proteins in oocytes are degraded and new proteins encoded by the zygotic genome are synthesized. We found that autophagy, a process for the degradation of cytoplasmic constituents in the lysosome, plays a critical role during this period. Autophagy was triggered by fertilization and up-regulated in early mouse embryos. Autophagy-defective oocytes derived from oocyte-specific Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) knockout mice failed to develop beyond the four- and eight-cell stages if they were fertilized by Atg5-null sperm, but could develop if they were fertilized by wild-type sperm. Protein synthesis rates were reduced in the autophagy-null embryos. Thus, autophagic degradation within early embryos is essential for preimplantation development in mammals.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) mediate the degradation of cellular proteins. However, we are now realizing that autophagy can also be a selective process that degrades various organelles. Peter and co-workers discovered a selective autophagic pathway that targets ribosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This pathway, which they termed ribophagy, depends on Ubp3 ubiquitin protease and its partner Bre5. This is an important finding, because it suggests that the number of ribosomes can be adjusted to match the needs of the cell. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The essential autophagy protein and haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, Beclin 1, interacts with several cofactors (Ambrai, Bif-1, UVRAG) to activate the lipid kinase Vps34, thereby inducing autophagy. In normal conditions, Beclin 1 is bound to and inhibited by Bcl-2 or the Bcl-2 homolog Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. This interaction involves a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain in Beclin 1 and the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-2/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. Other proteins containing BH3 domains, called BH3-only proteins, can competitively disrupt the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> to induce autophagy. Nutrient starvation, which is a potent physiologic inducer of autophagy, can stimulate the dissociation of Beclin 1 from its inhibitors, either by activating BH3-only proteins (such as Bad) or by posttranslational modifications of Bcl-2 (such as phosphorylation) that may reduce its affinity for Beclin 1 and BH3-only proteins. Thus, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins may participate in the inhibition and induction of autophagy, respectively. This hitherto neglected crosstalk between the core machineries regulating autophagy and apoptosis may redefine the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in oncogenesis and tumor progression. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Neuronal survival requires continuous lysosomal turnover of cellular constituents delivered by autophagy and endocytosis. Primary lysosomal dysfunction in inherited congenital "lysosomal storage" disorders is well known to cause severe neurodegenerative phenotypes associated with accumulations of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles (AVs). Recendy, the number of inherited adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases caused by proteins that regulate protein sorting and degradation within the endocytic and autophagic pathways has grown considerably. In this Perspective, we classify a group of neurodegenerative diseases across the lifespan as disorders of lysosomal function, which feature extensive autophagic-endocytic-lysosomal neuropadiology and may share mechanisms of neurodegeneration related to degradative failure and lysosomal destabilization. We highlight Alzheimer's disease as a disease within this group and discuss how each of the genes and other risk factors promoting this disease contribute to progressive lysosomal dysfunction and neuronal cell death. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy plays a critical protective role maintaining energy homeostasis and protein and organelle quality control. These functions are particularly important in times of metabolic stress and in cells with high energy demand such as cancer cells. In emerging cancer cells, autophagy defect may cause failure of energy homeostasis and protein and organelle quality control, leading to the accumulation of cellular damage in metabolic stress. Some manifestations of this damage, such as activation of the DNA damage response and generation of genome instability may promote tumor initiation and drive cell-autonomous tumor progression. In addition, in solid tumors, autophagy localizes to regions that are metabolically stressed. Defects in autophagy impair the survival of tumor cells in these areas, which is associated with increased cell death and inflammation. The cytokine response from inflammation may promote tumor growth and accelerate cell non-autonomous tumor progression. The overreaching theme is that autophagy protects cells from damage accumulation under conditions of metabolic stress allowing efficient tolerance and recovery from stress, and that this is a critical and novel tumor suppression mechanism. The challenge now is to define the precise aspects of autophagy, including energy homeostasis and protein and organelle turnover, that are required for the proper management of metabolic stress that suppress tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we need to be able to identify human tumors with deficient autophagy, and to develop rational cancer therapies that take advantage of the altered metabolic state and stress responses inherent to this autophagy defect. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: One of the major side effects of cisplatin chemotherapy is toxic acute kidney injury due to preferential accumulation of cisplatin in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and the subsequent injury to these cells. Apoptosis is known as a major mechanism of cisplatin-induced cell death in renal tubular cells. We have also recently demonstrated that autophagy induction is an immediate response of renal tubular epithelial cell exposure to cisplatin. Inhibition of cisplatin-induced autophagy blocks the formation of autophagosomes and enhances cisplatin-induced caspase-3, -6 and -7 activation, nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis. The switch from autophagy to apoptosis by autophagic inhibitors suggests that autophagy induction was responsible for a pre-apoptotic lag phase observed on exposure of renal tubular cells to cisplatin. Our studies provide evidence that autophagy induction in response to cisplatin mounts an adaptive response that suppresses and delays apoptosis. The beneficial effect of autophagy has a potential clinical significance in minimizing or preventing cisplatin nephrotoxicity. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cellular process whose primary function is to degrade long-lived proteins and recycle cellular components. Beside macroautophagy, there are several forms of selective autophagy, including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt), pexophagy and mitophagy. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about selective autophagy, and discuss its role in cell death and survival. We also discuss possible mechanisms underlying the selectivity of macroautophagy. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Programmed cell death in protists does not seem to make sense at first sight. However, apoptotic markers in unicellular organisms have been observed in all but one of the six/eight major groups of eukaryotes suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin of this regulated process. This review summarizes the available data on apoptotic markers in non-opisthokonts and elucidates potential functions and evolution of programmed cell death. A newly discovered family of caspase-like proteases, the metacaspases, is considered to exert the function of caspases in unicellular organisms. Important results on metacaspases, however, showed that they cannot be always correlated to the measured proteolytic activity during protist cell death. Thus, a major challenge for apoptosis research in a variety of protists remains the identification of the molecular cell death machinery. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aggregation may significantly affect the fate of a polypeptide, including its susceptibility to proteasome-dependent or autophagic degradation, its interaction with chaperones, etc. Since all these factors may affect the antigenicity of a polypeptide, we hypothesized that stimulating aggregation of an antigenic protein by its fusion to polyQ domain may enhance its antigenic potential. This hypothesis was tested with the weakly immunogenic model antigen GFP, which was fused to either long polyQ domain that triggers protein aggregation (103Q), or short polyQ domain that does not promote aggregation (25Q). Plasmids encoding control pGFP or soluble 25Q-GFP generated a very weak antibody response, while a significant increase in anti-GFP antibody titer was seen in groups immunized with DNA encoding aggregating 103Q-GFP. Similarly, fusion with 103Q strongly enhanced anti-GFP CTL activity, compared to fusion with 25Q. No apparent toxicity was observed after immunization with polyQ-GFP fusions. These data suggest that fusion of an antigen with expanded polyQ domains could have a significant adjuvant potential. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background - Recent reports demonstrate that multiple forms of cardiovascular stress, including pressure overload, chronic ischemia, and infarction-reperfusion injury, provoke an increase in autophagic activity in cardiomyocytes. However, nothing is known regarding molecular events that stimulate autophagic activity in stressed myocardium. Because autophagy is a highly conserved process through which damaged proteins and organelles can be degraded, we hypothesized that stress-induced protein aggregation is a proximal trigger of cardiomyocyte autophagy. Methods and Results - Here, we report that pressure overload promotes accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in the left ventricle, development of aggresome-like structures, and a corresponding induction of autophagy. To test for causal links, we induced protein accumulation in cultured cardiomyocytes by inhibiting proteasome activity, finding that aggregation of polyubiquitinated proteins was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte autophagy. Furthermore, attenuation of autophagic activity dramatically enhanced both aggresome size and abundance, consistent with a role for autophagic activity in protein aggregate clearance. Conclusions - We conclude that protein aggregation is a proximal trigger of cardiomyocyte autophagy and that autophagic activity functions to attenuate aggregate/aggresome formation in heart. Findings reported here are the first to demonstrate that protein aggregation occurs in response to hemodynamic stress, situating pressure-overload heart disease in the category of proteinopathies. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Secretory and membrane proteins that fail to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retained and may be sorted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). During ERAD, ER-associated components such as molecular chaperones and lectins recognize folding intermediates and specific oligosaccharyl modifications on ERAD substrates. Substrates selected for ERAD are then targeted for ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation. Because the catalytic steps of the ubiquitin-proteasome system reside in the cytoplasm, soluble ERAD substrates that reside in the ER lumen must be retrotranslocated back to the cytoplasm prior to degradation. In contrast, it has been less clear how polytopic, integral membrane substrates are delivered to enzymes required for ubiquitin conjugation and to the proteasome. In this review, we discuss recent studies addressing how ERAD substrates are recognized, ubiquitinated and delivered to the proteasome and then survey current views of how soluble and integral membrane substrates may be retrotranslocated. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Endolysosomal proteases such as cysteinyl and aspartyl cathepsins play diverse roles in inflammatory autoimmune diseases, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cysteinyl cathepsin B and aspartyl cathepsin D levels are markedly elevated in a variety of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Studies have also shown an increased cathepsin activity in AD patients where senile plaques and neuronal loss are marked features of the disease. Senile plaques contain amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide, which is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the proteases. In this article, we present the current knowledge of cysteinyl and aspartyl cathepsins in cellular and molecular events that lead to formation of senile plaques in AD. This article also focused on the role of cathepsin inhibitors as disease-modifying treatment strategies that could halt, or even prevent, this devastating neurological disorder. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to examine the role of autophagy in cell death by using a well-established system in which zVAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, induces necrotic cell death in L929 murine fibrosarcoma cells. First, we observed the presence of autophagic hallmarks, including an increased number of autophagosomes and the accumulation of LC3-II in zVAD-treated L929 cells. Since the presence of such autophagic hallmarks could be the result of either increased flux of autophagy or blockage of autophagosome maturation (lysosomal fusion and degradation), we next tested the effect of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor for mTOR, and chloroquine, a lysosomal enzyme inhibitor, on zVAD-induced cell death. To our surprise, rapamycin, known to be an autophagy inducer, blocked zVAD-induced cell death, whereas chloroquine greatly sensitized zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells. Moreover, similar results with rapamycin and chloroquine were also observed in U937 cells when challenged with zVAD. Consistently, induction of autophagy by serum starvation offered significant protection against zVAD-induced cell death, whereas knockdown of Atg5, Atg7 or Beclin 1 markedly sensitized zVAD-induced cell death in L929 cells. More importantly, Atg genes knockdown completely abolished the protective effect of serum starvation on zVAD-induced cell death. Finally, we demonstrated that zVAD was able to inhibit lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B activity, and subsequently blocked autophagosome maturation. Taken together, in contrast to the previous conception that zVAD induces autophagic cell death, here we provide compelling evidence suggesting that autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism and suppression of autophagy via inhibition of lysosomal function contributes to zVAD-induced necrotic cell death. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Mutations in the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit CHMP2B are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both human neurodegenerative diseases characterized by accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins aggregates in affected neurons. The ESCRT proteins are known to be involved in diverse cellular processes such as mRNA transport, cytokinesis, transcriptional regulation and sorting of transmembrane proteins into the inner vesicles of the multivesicular body (MVB) during endocytosis. It was until recently not clear how ESCRT function may be involved in neurodegeneration. New findings in mammalian cells and in Drosophila melanogaster show that functional ESCRTs are required for efficient fusion of autophagic vesicles with the endocytic pathway and for degradation of autophagic cargo. Moreover, defective ESCRT function led to the accumulation of cytoplasmic protein aggregates containing ubiquitin, p62/Sequestosome-1 and TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Using cellular and Drosophila models for Huntington's disease it was also shown that reduced ESCRT levels inhibit clearance of expanded polyglutamine aggregates and aggravate their neurotoxic effect. These data indicate that efficient autophagic degradation requires functional MVBs and provides a possible explanation to the observed neurodegenerative phenotype seen in patients with CHMP2B mutations. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: A great part of our current understanding of mammalian macroautophagy is derived from studies of the liver. The term "autophagy" was introduced by Christian de Duve in part based on ultrastructural changes in rat liver following glucagon injection. Subsequent morphological, biochemical, and kinetics studies of autophagy in the liver defined the basic process of autophagosome formation, maturation, and degradation and the regulation of autophagy by hormones, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, and mammalian target of rapamycin. It is now clear that macroautophagy in the liver is important for the balance of energy and nutrients for basic cell functions, the removal of misfolded proteins resulting from genetic mutations or pathophysiological stimulations, and the turnover of major subcellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. Disturbance of autophagy function in the liver could thus have a major impact on liver physiology and liver disease. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

ABSTRACT: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a conserved adaptive reaction that increases cell survival under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The UPR controls diverse processes such as protein folding, secretion, ER biogenesis, protein quality control and macroautophagy. Occurrence of chronic ER stress has been extensively described in neurodegenerative conditions linked to protein misfolding and aggregation, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Prion-related disorders, and conditions such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's disease. Strong correlations are observed between disease progression, accumulation of protein aggregates, and induction of the UPR in animal and in vivo models of neurodegeneration. In addition, the first reports are available describing the engagement of ER sbess responses in brain post-mortem samples from human patients. Despite such findings, the role of the UPR in the central nervous system has not been addressed directly and its contribution to neurodegeneraton remains speculative. Recently, however, pharmacological manipulation of ER stress and autophagy - a stress pathway modulated by the UPR - using chemical chaperones and autophagy activators has shown therapeutic benefits by attenuating protein misfolding in models of neurodegenerative disease. The most recent evidence addressing the role of the UPR and ER stress in neurodegenerative disorders is reviewed here, along with therapeutic strategies to alleviate ER stress in a disease context. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Protein cleavage is a central event in many regulated biological processes. We describe a system for detecting intracellular proteolysis based on non-conventional secretion of Gaussia luciferase (GLUC). GLUC exits the cell without benefit of a secretory leader peptide, but can be anchored in the cell by fusion to β-actin. By including protease cleavage sites between GLUC and β-actin, proteolytic cleavage can be detected. Using this assay, we have identified regulators of autophagy, apoptosis and β-actin cleavage. © 2008 Ketteler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The lysosomal compartment is essential for a variety of cellular functions, including the normal turnover of most long-lived proteins and all organelles. The compartment consists of numerous acidic vesicles (pH ∼4 to 5) that constantly fuse and divide. It receives a large number of hydrolases (∼50) from the trans-Golgi network, and substrates from both the cells' outside (heterophagy) and inside (autophagy). Many macromolecules contain iron that gives rise to an iron-rich environment in lysosomes that recently have degraded such macromolecules. Iron-rich lysosomes are sensitive to oxidative stress, while 'resting' lysosomes, which have not recently participated in autophagic events, are not. The magnitude of oxidative stress determines the degree of lysosomal destabilization and, consequently, whether arrested growth, reparative autophagy, apoptosis, or necrosis will follow. Heterophagy is the first step in the process by which immunocompetent cells modify antigens and produce antibodies, while exocytosis of lysosomal enzymes may promote tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Apart from being an essential turnover process, autophagy is also a mechanism by which cells will be able to sustain temporary starvation and rid themselves of intracellular organisms that have invaded, although some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to prevent their destruction. Mutated lysosomal enzymes are the underlying cause of a number of lysosomal storage diseases involving the accumulation of materials that would be the substrate for the corresponding hydrolases, were they not defective. The normal, low-level diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into iron-rich lysosomes causes the slow formation of lipofuscin in long-lived postmitotic cells, where it occupies a substantial part of the lysosomal compartment at the end of the life span. This seems to result in the diversion of newly produced lysosomal enzymes away from autophagosomes, leading to the accumulation of malfunctioning mitochondria and proteins with consequent cellular dysfunction. If autophagy were a perfect turnover process, postmitotic ageing and several age-related neurodegenerative diseases would, perhaps, not take place. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy has emerged as another major "programmed" mechanism to control life and death much like "programmed cell death" is for apoptosis in eukaryotes. We examined the expression of autophagic proteins and formation of autophagosomes during progression of cisplatin injury to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC). Autophagy was detected as early as 2-4 h after cisplatin exposure as indicated by induction of LC3-I, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II protein, and upregulation of Beclin 1 and Atg5, essential markers of autophagy. The appearance of cisplatin-induced punctated staining of autophagosome-associated LC3-II upon GFP-LC3 transfection in RTEC provided further evidence for autophagy. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked punctated staining of autophagosomes. The staining of normal cells with acridine orange displayed green fluorescence with cytoplasmic and nuclear components in normal cells but displayed considerable red fluorescence in cisplatin-treated cells, suggesting formation of numerous acidic autophagolysosomal vacuoles. Autophagy inhibitors LY294002 or 3-methyladenine or wortmannin inhibited the formation of autophagosomes but induced apoptosis after 2-4 h of cisplatin treatment as indicated by caspase-3/7 and -6 activation, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death. This switch from autophagy to apoptosis by autophagic inhibitors further suggests that the preapoptotic lag phase after treatment with cisplatin is mediated by autophagy. At later stages of cisplatin injury, apoptosis was also found to be associated with autophagy, as autophagic inhibitors and inactivation of autophagy proteins Beclin 1 and Atg5 enhanced activation of caspases and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that induction of autophagy mounts an adaptive response, suppresses cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and prolongs survival of RTEC.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a bulk cytosolic degradative process which in the last few years has become a key pathway for the advancement of molecular medicine. Autophagy (cellular self-eating) has several implications in human disorders involving accumulation of cytosolic protein aggregatas such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington diseases, as well as in myopathies caused by deficient lysosomal functions and in cancer. Moreover, autophagy affects intracellular microorganism lifespan, acting either as a cellular defense mechanism or, on the contrary, promoting pathogen replication. Furthermore, autophagy also participates in antigen presentation, as a part of the adaptive immune response. Therefore, autophagy association with cell survival or cell death would depend on cell nutrition conditions, presence of cell intruders, and alterations in oncogene or suppressor gene expression. In this review we will focus on the wide spectra of disease-related topics where autophagy is involved, particularly, in those processes concerning microorganism infections. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an important intracellular recycling system in eukaryotes that utilizes small vesicles to traffic cytosolic proteins and organelles to the vacuole for breakdown. Vesicle formation requires the conjugation of the two ubiquitin-fold polypeptides ATG8 and ATG12 to phosphatidylethanolamine and the ATG5 protein, respectively. Using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants affecting the ATG5 target or the ATG7 E1 required to initiate ligation of both ATG8 and ATG12, we previously showed that the ATG8/12 conjugation pathways together are important when plants encounter nutrient stress and during senescence. To characterize the ATG12 conjugation pathway specifically, we characterized a null mutant eliminating the E2-conjugating enzyme ATG10 that, similar to plants missing ATG5 or ATG7, cannot form the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. atg10-1 plants are hypersensitive to nitrogen and carbon starvation and initiate senescence and programmed cell death (PCD) more quickly than wild type, as indicated by elevated levels of senescence- and PCD-related mRNAs and proteins during carbon starvation. As detected with a GFP-ATG8a reporter, atg10-1 and atg5-1 mutant plants fail to accumulate autophagic bodies inside the vacuole. These results indicate that ATG10 is essential for ATG12 conjugation and that the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate is necessary to form autophagic vesicles and for the timely progression of senescence and PCD in plants.

ABSTRACT: Research in autophagy continues to accelerate,<sup>1</sup> and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose.<sup>2,3</sup> There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that includes delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of the methods that can be used by investigators who are attempting to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as by reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that investigate these processes. This set of guidelines is not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to verify an autophagic response. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a regulated pathway for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents and organelles, an important process involved in many physiological and pathological conditions in multiple organs, including the nervous system. It has been proposed that developing autophagosomes fuse with late endosomal compartments before their fusion with lysosomes; however, little is known about the functional relationship between the autophagy and endocytic pathways. In the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, a key step in sorting transmembrane cargo proteins is regulated by multimeric complexes called ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport). We recently reported that dysfunction of ESCRT-III, either by depletion of its essential subunit mSnf7-2 or by expression of a mutant CHMP2B protein associated with frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3), caused autophagosome accumulation and dendritic retraction before neurodegeneration in cultured mature cortical neurons. This defect is likely a result of an abnormal fusion process between autophagosomes and endosomal compartments or lysosomes. This study suggests that defects in the late steps of the autophagy pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of FTD and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Salmonella enterica is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that inhabits membrane-bound vacuoles of eukaryotic cells. Coined as the 'Salmonella-containing vacuole' (SCV), this compartment has been studied for two decades as a replicative niche. Recent findings reveal, however, marked differences in the lifestyle of bacteria enclosed in the SCV of varied host cell types. In fibroblasts, the emerging view supports a model of bacteria facing in the SCV a 'to grow' or 'not to grow' dilemma, which is solved by entering in a dormancy-like state. Fine-tuning of host cell defense/survival routes, drastic metabolic shift down, adaptation to hypoxia conditions, and attenuation of own virulence systems emerge as strategies used by Salmonella to intentionally reduce the growth rate inside the SCV. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Autophagy principally serves an adaptive role to protect organisms against diverse pathologies, including infections, cancer, neurodegeneration, aging, and heart disease. However, in certain experimental disease settings, the self-cannibalistic or, paradoxically, even the prosurvival functions of autophagy may be deleterious. This Review summarizes recent advances in understanding the physiological functions of autophagy and its possible roles in the causation and prevention of human diseases. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Apoptosis and autophagy are genetically-regulated, evolutionarily-conserved processes that regulate cell fate. Both apoptosis and autophagy are important in development and normal physiology and in a wide range of diseases. Recent studies show that despite the marked differences between these two processes, their regulation is intimately connected and the same regulators can sometimes control both apoptosis and autophagy. In this review, I discuss some of these findings, which provide possible molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest that it may be useful to think of these processes as different facets of the same cell death continuum rather than completely separate processes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy is a lysosomal catabolic process involved in recycling cell components and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Identifying some of the molecules involved in the control and execution steps of autophagy has shed light on the close link between autophagy and tumour progression. Several tumour-suppressor proteins -including Beclin 1, a protein involved in autophagosome formation- positively regulate autophagy. Conversely, some oncogenic proteins display inhibitory effects on autophagy. The antitumoral role of autophagy is supported by its involvement in reducing chromosome instability, proliferation and inflammation of tumour cells. However, autophagy can also be a protumoral mechanism which helps tumour cells to adapt to changes in their microenvironment (hypoxia, starvation...). Moreover, autophagy is induced in response to several anticancer treatments. This response can either be a mechanism allowing cell survival or a mechanism promoting cell death. The aim of this article is to summarize recent progress focusing on the dual role of autophagy in cancer. © John Libbey Eurotext.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway for the clearance of damaged or superfluous proteins and organelles. The recycling of these intracellular constituents also serves as an alternative energy source during periods of metabolic stress to maintain homeostasis and viability. In tumour cells with defects in apoptosis, autophagy allows prolonged survival. Paradoxically, autophagy defects are associated with increased tumorigenesis, but the mechanism behind this has not been determined. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy provides a protective function to limit tumour necrosis and inflammation, and to mitigate genome damage in tumour cells in response to metabolic stress. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

ABSTRACT: The latest discoveries in biology invite us to consider life as a series of on-going metamorphoses. This paper shows that processes such as programmed cell-death or the cell-suicide mechanism, which shape life, should prompt us to reconsider our own conceptions of life and death, away from the temptations of both anthropomorphism and sociobology. Thus the way we think about life as a whole, be it related to cellular or social organisation, should be reconsidered in the light of the latest findings in medicine and biology.

ABSTRACT: Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to the lysosome. Despite its simplicity, recent progress has demonstrated that autophagy plays a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles, which are sometimes complex. Autophagy consists of several sequential steps - sequestration, transport to lysosomes, degradation, and utilization of degradation products - and each step may exert different function. In this review, the process of autophagy is summarized, and the role of autophagy is discussed in a process-based manner. © 2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.
